Think of how much farmers depend on government subsidies. On the flip side, think of the substandard levels of government services in a lot of big cities. People are always more complicated and contradictory than any one data point about them suggests.", "Gail: Certainly true, as we have been reminded every single day lately.", "Bret: Speaking of data, Gail, one interesting thing about this election is how badly most of the pollsters seem to have muffed their electoral predictions. Just take a look at the FiveThirtyEight election eve polls. In Ohio, they gave Trump an edge of 0.8 percentage points. He won by 8 points. In Florida, the FiveThirtyEight forecast had Biden beating Trump by 2.5 percentage points. Trump ended up with a 3 point lead. In Wisconsin, they gave Biden an 8.4 point lead. Biden won it by less than a point.", "Should this be the end of the polling as we\u2019ve known it?", "Gail: I was always in awe of the polling people just because they had to walk that tightrope of expectations. One bad prediction and you\u2019re in free-fall.", "Bret: In this case, it\u2019s been two massive failures in consecutive presidential elections. The failure will be partially obscured by Biden\u2019s ultimate victory, but there ought to be some accountability for the industry.", "Gail: It\u2019s become very, very clear that getting accurate predictions is next to impossible when the subject is Donald Trump. And I\u2019m not sure what will happen after he\u2019s actually gone (please, God). Maybe people will go back to giving more reliable responses to the surveyors. Or maybe the science just doesn\u2019t work well in our new digital universe.", "Bret: We definitely learned that the phenomenon of the shy Trump voter didn\u2019t end when he became president. We also learned that people don\u2019t necessarily vote the way they are often typecast by parts of the media. Exit polls showed Trump doubled his support among L.G.B.T.Q. voters. His share of the Hispanic vote also went up steeply, and he also did better with Black voters this time around. Another reminder that people are just \u2026 complicated.", "Gail: Before we go, tell me \u2014 any big surprises for you in the Senate races?", "Bret: The biggest surprise for me was in Maine, with Susan Collins\u2019s thumping win over Sara Gideon. (Not to belabor a theme here, Gail, but FiveThirtyEight gave Gideon a 59 percent chance of winning.) On the other hand, I predicted Joni Ernst\u2019s win in Iowa, Thom Tillis\u2019s in North Carolina and Lindsey Graham\u2019s in South Carolina. The big question for everyone is whether Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler manage to hold on to their seats in Georgia, which will determine control of the Senate."], "authors": ["Gail Collins", "Bret Stephens"], "keywords": ["think", "trump", "win", "fury", "big", "scorned", "gave", "points", "opinion", "fivethirtyeight", "won", "biden", "hath", "point", "hell"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
