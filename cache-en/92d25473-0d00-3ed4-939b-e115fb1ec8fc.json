Swift wrote on Twitter:", "To put it plainly, we just couldn\u2019t stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. I\u2019ve never done this before. In the past I\u2019ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them.", "Bon Iver again guests on one track, with another featuring Dessner\u2019s band the National, and another with the pop-rock trio Haim. Swift also said she has directed the video for the song Willow, released at the same time as the album, the latest in a string of self-directed videos including Lover, The Man and Cardigan.", "Tonight the story continues, as the music video for \u201cwillow\u201d drops at midnight eastern. pic.twitter.com/T3o0nsANpY \u2014 Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) December 10, 2020", "It\u2019s been a creatively fertile year for Swift: a live album and film with material from Folklore, The Long Pond Studio Sessions, was also released last month.", "Swift is also currently re-recording her first six albums, amid a dispute over the master recordings with music mogul Scooter Braun.
