Known for thriving in dust and soil, clostridium has the power to contaminate honey. In cases where it does, the honey is dangerous for a baby\u2019s digestive system because it isn\u2019t strong enough to fend off the bacteria. This can cause infant botulism, with serious results. Typical symptoms from this type of food poisoning include poor sucking, lethargy, a weak cry, constipation and decreased muscle tone, for example.", "Food poisoning experts avoid these foods, too.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "How a Baby\u2019s Developing Digestive System Reacts", "The main reason infants can\u2019t handle the clostridium bacteria and adults can is because of digestive system maturity.
