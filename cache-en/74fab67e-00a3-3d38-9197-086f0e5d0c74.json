is stranded,", "so we have to give him a little bit of leeway there.", "But, one thing that would be very challenging to me", "would be getting the shark out of the water.", "And whenever bow fishing happens,", "there's a reel that you attach to your bow,", "and there's an attachment for it to go to the arrow,", "so when you shoot,", "you have the string that trails after the arrow,", "and then

target,", "but then the back end needs to be stabilized,", "otherwise there's gonna be more oscillation", "left and right, versus when you add that vane on there,", "it's gonna be able to spin,",

the bow", "once you draw back, and that's something that's unique", "to a compound bow.", "This is my hunting compound.", "What you'll notice that's different", "from some of the other bows we've seen today", "are these wheels on it, and we call these cams,", "and they have basically like a pulley system in them.", "So whenever you draw the bow back,", "there will be a break-over moment,", "versus a longbow or a traditional bow,", "where you can keep drawing, keep drawing, keep drawing", "until pretty much the bow breaks.", "The one thing that I would critique", "is the fact that there's not really a rest,", "or a place for that arrow to be sitting on.", "Usually you would have a separate rest", "that you would attach to the bow", "for it to hold the arrow up,", "versus it just sitting on

II.", "Them calling it a range finder is incorrect,", "I would just call this a sight.", "A range finder has a system of lasers", "that determines a distance", "between you and a particular target,",

pulled the string", "off of one end of the bow, and just took it off.", "You have to actually put pressure onto the bow", "to get the limb to move and flex,", "to get that string off, because it's under tension.", "And then whenever she strung the bow again,", "she kind of just pulled the limb down", "and then put the string on,", "which, depending on the weight of the bow", "is pretty impractical,", "you have to have like a 15, 20 pound bow", "to be able to do something like that maneuver", "for it to actually work.", "The last piece of equipment", "that they put on this bow is a grip,", "and they claim that this would help with", "decreasing weapon sway.", "To my knowledge, the only way", "to kind of change the way your bow moves or doesn't move", "would be to add stabilizers.", "A grip is just to fit your hand,", "cause everybody's hands are different.", "When you look at my bow that I compete with,", "I have these bars on my bow that hang off,", "that help balance the bow.", "Yeah, this'll do.", "Let's talk about targets.", "Moving target, Far Cry 3.", "[dramatic music]", "[man yells]", "The first thing that jumps out at me", "is just the delayed reaction of the shot.", "You hear the shot hit [arrow strikes],", "and then the guy goes [man yells],", "and it's just like so delayed, it cracks me up.", "Something that you would look at in this scenario", "would be the movement of the truck,", "the movement of the people in the truck.", "You also have to take into account the sunshine,", "versus wind and direction and all of that stuff.",

fires]", "[arrow strikes]", "[Man] That's sloppy shooting, friend.", "I actually would kinda disagree,", "because the person is shooting center mass,", "and then they're shooting lower than the sternum.", "So the sternum's gonna be a pretty solid bone", "to shoot against.", "You see on the end of the arrow, it has a broadhead.", "These blades don't move, they're razor-sharp,", "and pretty much stay that way,", "but whenever you shoot, it stays open like that.", "I think that's pretty accurate to what happens in real life.", "[Man] That was close, but still off the mark.", "Making an arrow, The Forest.", "[Man] In this video, I'm gonna quickly show you", "how to craft the bow and arrow in the forest,", "add the cloth, add the rope, and then add your stick.", "Craft it together,

a lot of knots and burrs on it,", "and it also had quite a few V's off", "for like twigs and stuff like that.", "[Man] And you now have your bow.", "I would try to find all one contiguous piece.",

execution or the making of the arrows,", "I would say trying to find straighter sticks,", "and then kind of whittling those down", "into straight cylinders,", "versus something that's a little bit more crooked,", "and all of that's just for accuracy.", "Hidden target, Wii Sports Resort.", "[crowd cheers]", "I've actually shot some fruit before,", "it makes your arrows very sticky,", "and it's
