I was on a patio, lighting birthday candles on a pan of frosted cinnamon rolls. I had on a cotton nightgown like a Victorian ghost. First a finger felt hot, and then an industrial furnace seemed to blast behind me. It was so very hot. Something\u2019s wrong, I thought or whispered, turning to confront what I imagined was a steel foundry someone must have set up in our yard. My partner Richard emerged. It was his birthday. This was supposed to be a surprise, I thought, as out of the corner of my eye, I saw that I was the foundry, and the nightgown\u2019s hem\u2014now farther up the nightgown, now consuming my legs\u2014was on fire.", "Richard commanded \u201cstop, drop, and roll,\u201d and for a fraction of a second I wanted to say, I know, I know the slogan, we all know the slogan. Infinite options presented themselves, prismatically, but also on a spectrum\u2014shades between cold and hot, or their new equivalents: life and death. My mind was also ablaze with self-justification. *I can\u2019t pitch forward because I\u2019m on stone, and besides the fire is behind me, and \u2026 * I aimed to fall backward, as in a pool plunge or trust fall, but instead I sat down hard. That made something good happen.", "But not good enough. In a wordless exchange Richard and I agreed the fire wasn\u2019t out, and I was conscious of needing to roll to supine, to complete the triptych, but before I could start, Richard clobbered me with an afghan. Patting, patting, patting, clobbering, now I knew it was out; I wanted to explain why I hadn\u2019t rolled, but as I struggled to my feet it dawned on me that in a second or two I had undergone some kind of metamorphosis. I\u2019d deal with the Gregor Samsa component of the morning later.", "Happy birthday happy birthday I\u2019ll be right back\u2014I was a little overbright now. The Aquaphor was in my daughter\u2019s room. The Tylenol was in mine. I was slipping back into real clothes when my right leg was suffused with something bad, so bad, something plausibly \u201cevil,\u201d underworld spirits with no name. The bath was running before I even got there. Sequences were becoming nonlinear. The cold water hit like a narcotic; my terror tilted into galactic well-being. My right thigh, now my sole preoccupation, was overwhelmed with gratitude. That didn\u2019t last. The high waned almost the moment it started, and life-giving water betrayed me when its temperature mounted by even half a degree. I opened the cold tap as wide as I could and kept that glacial gush coming, and the bliss returned, but I was then frantic when the water warmed. Cold cold colder colder colder colder don\u2019t stop ice ice icecold. I ordered myself to stay conscious.", "The cold water hit like a narcotic; my terror tilted into galactic well-being.", "After some number of cold-warm, bliss-agony cycles, I uncertainly called for Richard. He worried the water was too cold. Could anything be too cold? But my body was shivering and bluish. Richard carried me to the bed where he put a cold cloth on the burns. Thus started a cycle where washcloths in ice water were applied to the burns and the pleasure was extraordinary\u2014for a few seconds. Then the neural storm kicked up, and raged. A cloth any warmer than freezing felt like a greasy boiling rag, and I\u2019d groan like an animal, throwing it aside and grabbing a fresh icy one. Around and around like this for hours. Richard put socks and a hat on me, and a sweater, and blankets. For the rest of the day, icy cloths were my morphine, and I called out for them like a fiend."], "authors": ["Virginia Heffernan", "Virginia Hefferna"], "keywords": ["colder", "nightgown", "ice", "birthday", "hot", "cold", "right", "richard", "patting", "know", "wrong", "flames", "water"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
