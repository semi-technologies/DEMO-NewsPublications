As at many luxury buildings, the fleet of workers who perform the cleaning, stocking, fixing, and general upkeep of these spaces are admitted via a service entrance; when a plumber or a furniture-delivery person arrives for a job, he is obligated to check in at a security desk near the service elevators, where he can observe the flow of building employees coming in and out. It was here, in June, 2015, that John Elliott, a union carpenter and woodwork installer, who was working a job inside one of the building\u2019s condominiums, saw handcarts stacked high with kegs of beer being rolled out by a small group of men grinning ear to ear, like they\u2019d pulled off a jewel heist.", "\u201cThat was the end of Trump Gold,\u201d Elliott told me recently. He\u2019s now retired, but that particular morning has stayed with him over the years; it\u2019s a story he loves to tell. \u201cIt was a fleeting moment\u2014it probably lasted all of thirty seconds\u2014but I knew right away what was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could see the labels.\u201d The beer, a blond ale produced by the local brewery 5 Rabbit Cervecer\u00eda, had been available for a little more than a month as the house beer of Rebar, a lounge in the hotel\u2019s mezzanine. The white-label commission had been a windfall for 5 Rabbit, the sort of reliable income stream that can be a lifeline for a small brewery. The partnership was born out of affinity. 5 Rabbit describes itself as a \u201cLatin American-inspired brewery\u201d; Mauricio Kuri, a former food-and-beverage manager at the Chicago Trump Tower, who is Mexican, had felt connected to the brewery and its mission, and commissioned the custom ale, which was on tap at Rebar and stocked, in bottles, in the hotel rooms\u2019 minibars. \u201cIt was huge for us,\u201d Mila Ramirez, a partner at 5 Rabbit, told me, of getting the contract.", "Then, on June 16, 2015, Donald Trump kicked off his campaign for President with a speech in which he smeared Latinx immigrants, particularly those from Mexico. \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d Ramirez was born in Peru and grew up in countries including Brazil and Venezuela; her husband, Andr\u00e9s Araya, was born in Costa Rica. The couple had lived in Mexico City, where their first daughter was born, and many of the brewery\u2019s employees were Mexican. To 5 Rabbit, Trump\u2019s comments were deeply personal. \u201cAll Trump had been to us before then was this clown of reality TV,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cFor him to use his platform to speak the way he spoke of my culture\u2014we thought, O.K., we need to remove ourselves completely. I was, like, \u2018I will hop in my car right now. I\u2019m going to get my beer back!\u2019 \u201d", "Within a week, 5 Rabbit had called its distributor, killed its contract with Rebar, and repossessed Trump Golden Ale, about fifty kegs in all. The business couldn\u2019t afford to write the beer off as a loss, so Ramirez, Araya, and their partners began calling friends at bars and restaurants and explaining the situation. Within a couple of hours, the entire stock was accounted for. \u201cAll the local places, they all mentioned what a big part of their restaurant family or bar family Latinos and Latinas were\u2014back of house, doing a lot of the cooking, a lot of the dishwashing. Without that community, the restaurant and bar business wouldn\u2019t even exist,\u201d Ramirez said. On the kegs\u2019 collars\u2014the round, sticker-like labels found on top of the reusable metal barrels\u2014a 5 Rabbit employee made a spontaneous edit. \u201cAnd I guess\u2014I don\u2019t really know, but I guess\u2014that it was one of the guys at the brewery who, as a joke, took a Sharpie and wrote \u2018Chinga tu Madre Donald\u2019 \u201d\u2014Spanish for, more or less, \u201cfuck your mother, Donald\u201d\u2014Ramirez said. \u201cAnd it went out the door like that. And some bars started using that name, and that\u2019s what the beer became.\u201d", "5 Rabbit Cervecer\u00eda is named after Macuiltochtli, the Aztec god of drunkenness, a rabbit-shaped deity who is one of the Ahuiateteo, a quintet of gods who embody various excesses. The business is unabashedly Latinx in its branding and values; their brews draw inspiration (and ingredients, such as the Peruvian chocolate in their CaCao imperial stout) from throughout South and Central America, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and from the broader Latinx diaspora. Some beers are named for the rest of the Ahuiateteo\u20145 Lizard, 5 Vulture\u2014and their ultra-small-batch Loter\u00eda beers are inspired by the cards of the Mexican game of chance. Some of the brewery\u2019s best-sellers are the American-style beers of their \u201cGringolandia\u201d quartet, which in their original runs had the name stamped across the bottles and cans in a swirly, Disneyland-style typeface: America as a magic kingdom, a place of fantasy.", "\u201cI remember perfectly, there was a beer buyer in Chicago who said, \u2018I am not buying this, because you\u2019re making fun of Americans by calling it Gringolandia\u2019\u2014even though we were doing the opposite,\u201d Ramirez said. She was speaking to me over FaceTime from 5 Rabbit\u2019s brewery and tasting room, which sits in an industrial park near Midway Airport. The warehouse space is filled with rows of silvery fermentation tanks; one wall is hung with the flags of Costa Rica, the United States, and Mexico; other walls are decorated with vast, colorful murals painted by artists from Chicago and Mexico. Ramirez is forty-two, with expressive eyebrows and a waterfall of dark hair. During our call, she walked through the space, pausing to scratch the ears of the brewery cat, Sim\u00f3n, and eventually sat down in front of a mural depicting the Virgin of Guadalupe wearing a red gown painted with flowers that resemble hops blossoms. Gringolandia was conceived, Ramirez explained, as an homage to the dream of emigration, the hope of finding a better life in the United States. But, she added, once you realize people think you\u2019re saying something you\u2019re not, \u201cyou cannot desmentir\u2014there\u2019s no good word for that in English, but it\u2019s like to \u2018un-lie,\u2019 to fix the incorrect story.\u201d The brewery took the word \u201cGringolandia\u201d off the beer.", "It wasn\u2019t the only 5 Rabbit creation whose name came up for revision. Just a few weeks after Chinga tu Madre made its public d\u00e9but, Ramirez said, she saw someone posting negatively about the beer on Twitter\u2014not about its political message, necessarily, but about its name. \u201cThey were, like, \u2018Isn\u2019t this name misogynist? How is his mother involved in this?\u2019 \u201d she recalled. Ramirez, a committed feminist, took the note to heart. (\u201cThough Trump\u2019s mother, I\u2019ve read, wasn\u2019t so great either,\u201d she noted.) She called an emergency confab of the brewery\u2019s partners, and they settled on an amended title, a little lighter in tone but still clearly dissenting: Chinga tu Pelo\u2014\u201cFuck Your Hair.\u201d", "In the weeks after Chinga tu Pelo\u2019s ersatz launch, the brewery\u2019s social-media and voice-mail in-boxes filled up with notes of support, and with screeds from angry Trump supporters. A driver from one of their distributors refused to drive any truck containing the beer. If Ramirez believes in not offending people, I asked her, did she ever consider pulling the beer entirely? \u201cI\u2019ve always said that it\u2019s not my intention to offend,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the minute I feel anyone is being disrespected because of color, religion, sexual orientation, anything\u2014I will always feel comfortable disrespecting the person who is disrespecting. I think that\u2019s what Chinga tu Pelo is about.\u201d", "When Trump was sworn in as President, in January of 2017, 5 Rabbit renamed Chinga tu Pelo yet again. \u201cWe needed to make something more active, more about doing something, not just reacting,\u201d Ramirez explained. The new name was La Protesta (\u201cthe Protest\u201d), and the brewery used it to bring attention to the progressive values that the Trump Administration seemed intent on eroding: immigrant rights, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, voter access. The beer continued to sell (the filmmaker Lilly Wachowski designed a can in honor of trans rights), but customers still clamored for Chinga tu Pelo\u2014never mind that La Protesta was the exact same beer. \u201cF*** Your Hair,\u201d a documentary short about the beer, from 2019, raised the beer\u2019s profile even more\u2014especially, this August, when the film mysteriously disappeared from Amazon, its streaming distributor, seemingly in response to a co\u00f6rdinated complaint campaign by Trump supporters. (Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.)", "Earlier this year, by popular demand, 5 Rabbit brought back the Chinga tu Pelo branding. In the weeks leading up to the election, Ramirez told me, she received daily requests for the beer, mostly from people out of state, especially New York and California. 5 Rabbit doesn\u2019t work with any distributors who are licensed to ship alcohol outside of the state, so she was busy telling people no. Even if Ramirez could have shipped the beer, though, supplies were dwindling. When I spoke to her in early October, she had only two cases left at the brewery. She later dug up more from an off-site storage unit, and she\u2019ll be serving it at an Election Night party she\u2019s hosting. Depending on how things turn out, the beers that her guests drink may be among the final cans. \u201cIf Trump loses, that\u2019s it,\u201d Ramirez told me. \u201cWe\u2019re done, once he\u2019s gone. I hope we never brew Chinga tu Pelo ever again.\u201d", "Read More About the 2020 Election"], "authors": ["Helen Rosner", "Helen Rosne", "Susan B.
