The Clinton administration could have jammed the radio signals and taken those broadcasts off the air , but Pentagon lawyers decided against it, citing free speech. It\u2019s true that the propagandists\u2019 speech would have been curtailed. It\u2019s also possible that a genocide would have been averted.", "I am not calling for repealing the First Amendment, or even for banning speech I find offensive on private platforms. What I\u2019m arguing against is paralysis. We can protect unpopular speech from government interference while also admitting that unchecked speech can expose us to real risks. And we can take steps to mitigate those risks.", "The Constitution prevents the government from using sticks, but it says nothing about carrots.", "Congress could fund, for example, a national campaign to promote news literacy, or it could invest heavily in library programming. It could build a robust public media in the mold of the BBC. It could rethink Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 the rule that essentially allows Facebook and YouTube to get away with (glorification of) murder. If Congress wanted to get really ambitious, it could fund a rival to compete with Facebook or Google, the way the Postal Service competes with FedEx and U.P.S.", "Or the private sector could pitch in on its own. Tomorrow, by fiat, Mark Zuckerberg could make Facebook slightly less profitable and enormously less immoral: He could hire thousands more content moderators and pay them fairly. Or he could replace Sheryl Sandberg with Susan Benesch, a human rights lawyer and an expert on how speech can lead to violence. Social media companies have shown how quickly they can act when under pressure. After every high-profile eruption of violence \u2014 Charlottesville, Christchurch and the like \u2014 tech companies have scrambled to ban inflammatory accounts, take down graphic videos, even rewrite their terms of service. Some of the most egregious actors, such as Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, have been permanently barred from all major platforms.", "\u201cWe need to protect the rights of speakers,\u201d John A. Powell, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me, \u201cbut what about protecting everyone else?\u201d Mr. Powell was the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and he represented the Ku Klux Klan in federal court. \u201cRacists should have rights,\u201d he explained. \u201cI also know, being black and having black relatives, what it means to have a cross burned on your lawn. It makes no sense for the law to be concerned about one and ignore the other.\u201d", "Mr. Powell, in other words, is a free-speech advocate but not a free-speech absolutist. Shortly before his tenure as legal director, he said, \u201cwhen women complained about sexual harassment in the workplace, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s response would be, \u2018Sorry, nothing we can do. Harassment is speech.\u2019 That looks ridiculous to us now, as it should.\u201d He thinks that some aspects of our current First Amendment jurisprudence \u2014 blanket protections of hate speech, for example \u2014 will also seem ridiculous in retrospect. \u201cIt\u2019s simpler to think only about the First Amendment and to ignore, say, the 14th Amendment, which guarantees full citizenship and equal protection to all Americans, including those who are harmed by hate speech,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simpler, but it\u2019s also wrong.\u201d"], "id": "12e4fc28-f071-3a56-928a-7267fd3f72f5", "pubDate": null, "title": "Opinion | Free Speech Is Killing Us"}
