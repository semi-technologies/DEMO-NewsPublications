Beeld Eigen foto's", "On Sunday, during a concert in Afas Live, Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder recalled the meeting he had with a Dutch woman 27 years ago. After the concert, she gave him a lift to his hotel room on the back of her bike. He often thinks back to this encounter, he told the audience.", "The woman herself remembers it vividly too, she told the Dutch newspaper Het Parool on Tuesday. A former co-student and her husband had mailed the newspaper earlier. At first, she thought it was a joke. \u201cBut surely there weren\u2019t other girls who took Eddie Vedder to his hotel room on the back of their brother\u2019s bike?\u201d", "Valeska Custers \u2013 at the time, Dijkstra \u2013 attended the Pearl Jam concert in Tivoli, Utrecht in March of 1992 (not Amsterdam\u2019s Melkweg, as Vedder believed). The 23-year-old student did not come for the up-and-coming grunge band from Seattle, but for the supporting act: the Dutch band City Pig Unit, in which a friend of hers played.", "Shy", "The concert was \u2018awesome\u2019, recalls Custers. \u201cI watched together with Koen, the guitarist of City Pig Unit. At one point Eddie climbed all the way to the top to the upper speakers. All the girls backstage went completely mad afterwards.\u201d Custers kept her distance. \u201cBut then he approached me. \u2018How do you like my new tattoo?,\u2019 he asked. I told him I liked it. He was extremely shy, but I really felt a connection with him.\u201d", "Vedder wanted to get a drink after the concert and asked Custers to join him at Kaf\u00e9 Belgi\u00eb. \u201cI declined because I wanted to help the members of City Pig Unit pack up their gear.\u201d Once the instruments were loaded onto the van, Custers plucked up the courage and walked into the caf\u00e9. \u201cHe was sitting there with only girls again. He immediately saw me and pulled up a chair. That\u2019s how I got to sit next to him.\u201d", "They talked for hours, and Custers wrote her address in his diary. At about 3 a.m., the rocker thought about getting to bed. \u201cI offered to call him a taxi, but he asked: Do you have a bike? He wanted to ride on the back.\u201d", "Custers cycled through the centre of Utrecht on her brother\u2019s bike, with Vedder on the back. As Vedder said at the concert on Sunday night, she did indeed have long, blond hair that fluttered in his face as they cycled. There were stops along the way; Vedder took a picture of Custers twice.", "Eddie Vedder in Tivoli and during the concert in Afas Live. Beeld Marcel Wagenaar (rechts)", "Backpack", "Custers carried a backpack in which she had a white T-shirt and a red flannel shirt. The shirt, which Vedder mentioned on Sunday, also belonged to her brother.", "She wore it earlier that evening. \u201cBut I had purchased a City Pig Limit shirt in Tivoli and thought that was much cooler.\u201d During the bike trip, Vedder held on to the backpack \u2013 Custers can\u2019t recall if he also put on the shirt. She does know, however, that Vedder forgot to return the backpack when they said good-bye. Both the backpack and shirt have disappeared without a trace; Vedder probably took them.", "Custers describes the farewell by the Hilton Hotel in Utrecht as awkward. \u201cHe was so shy and modest. That also made him so nice.\u201d When they said good-bye, they shook hands and he kept waving at her as she cycled away.", "Custers went home and to bed \u2018with a wonderful memory\u2019. \u201cI still remember thinking: I\u2019m not going to give myself to him. He\u2019ll be somewhere else tomorrow and I\u2019ll be one of the thousands of girls.\u201d", "Soulmate", "But she certainly wasn't any other groupie to Vedder. After 27 years, Vedder still thinks of that moment, he said in Afas Live. \u201cI\u2019m almost certain I would recognise her face.\u201d", "Custers \u2013 now 49, moved from Utrecht to Hilversum, married and a mother to three girls \u2013 would also like to meet Vedder again. \u201cI have thought about it so many times, but I didn\u2019t know how I would arrange it. It would be great to meet again. He kind of feels like my soulmate.\u201d", "She did give it a try. Two years ago, when Vedder also played two concerts in Afas Live, she walked to the front before the start of the show, attracted the attention of a roadie and told him the story. \u201cCan you tell Eddie that the girl who took him to his hotel room years ago is here?\u201d It didn\u2019t lead to them meeting each other. She also went back to his concert in Carr\u00e9 in 2012, but didn\u2019t feel like waiting for him by the exit.", "In 1992, a few months after their nocturnal bike ride, she came close. She attended Pinkpop and spotted Stone Gossard, Pearl Jam\u2019s guitarist, at a terrace in Heerlen. She also told him the bike story and Gossard promised that she could go backstage during Torhout/Werchter. But unfortunately for Custers, that performance got cancelled.", "Whether the two will meet again after 27 years is unclear. Vedder will perform in Brussels on Wednesday evening and will then continue his tour in Italy, Portugal and Spain. There are no concerts scheduled in the Netherlands. Het Parool has approached Eddie Vedder\u2019s management.", "Translated by Paola Westbeek"], "authors": ["Hanneke Keultjes"], "keywords": ["thought", "bike", "gave", "forward", "extremely", "utrecht", "shirt", "told", "shy", "comes", "woman", "lift", "vedder", "eddie", "concert", "took", "custers"], "pubDate": "2019-06-11T18:07:00Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
