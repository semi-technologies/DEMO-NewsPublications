Peter Parker the Spectacular Spider-Man is one of the biggest characters in pop culture, so there was a real chance the Miles would get overshadowed by Peter\u2019s lasting legacy. Instead, in less than ten years, Miles has risen to become a defining character in his own right and an important piece of the Marvel Universe. However, if you\u2019re still relatively unfamiliar with Miles, we put together this handy overview. Here is everything you need to know about Miles Morales before playing Insomniac's upcoming open-world superhero romp.", "Real Name: Miles Gonzalo Morales", "Height: 5' 8\"*", "Weight: 160 lbs*", "Creators: Brian Michael Bendis, Sara Pichelli", "First Appearance: Ultimate Fallout #4 (October 2011)", "Character Creation", "Miles Morales was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli in 2011 in the comic Ultimate Fallout #4. In interviews, Bendis has stated that he was inspired to create Miles when he saw Donald Glover in a Spider-Man outfit on an episode of NBC\u2019s sitcom Community, which in turn was a nod to the online campaign to secure Glover an audition for the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. For Miles\u2019 new look, Pichelli designed a black and red consume, which paid homage to Peter Parker\u2019s original design while still feeling fresh.", "Miles debuted in Marvel\u2019s Ultimate line of comics, which was an alternate reality version of Marvel\u2019s main continuity. In that version of the Marvel Universe, Peter Parker had just died and Miles was positioned to take over the mantel of Spider-Man. Miles' critical reception was largely positive and fan enthusiasm for the new character was huge. In fact, Miles proved to be so popular that when Marvel ended the Ultimate imprint in 2015, and killed off that entire universe, it spared Miles and transferred him over to mainline Marvel continuity, where he has settled in as an important member of the Spider-Man family.", "Fictional Character Bio", "Morales was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an African American father named Jefferson Davis and a Puerto Rican mother named Rio Morales. When Miles was young, Jefferson was a police officer and Rio worked as a nurse. Like Peter, Miles is very smart, and Miles was selected in a lottery to attend Brooklyn Visions Academy where he became best friends with a young Korean American named Ganke Lee. After Miles gained his spider powers, Ganke was the first person who Miles told.", "During Miles\u2019 junior year of high school, he was bitten by a genetically-modified spider created by Oscorp in an attempt to replicate Peter Parker\u2019s extraordinary abelites (hey, this is comics). This spider bite grated Miles superhuman abilities similar \u2013 and yet slightly different \u2013 from those of Peter Parker (see Powers sidebar below).", "\u201cI feel like Miles is an avatar of teenage experience in a way that has advanced so much more than when Peter Parker was a teenager,\u201d says Insomniac writer Evan Narcisse. \u201cMy shorthand for this basically is saying that I personally believe that Miles, as a teenager, is cooler than Peter Parker as a teenager. He dresses better than Peter did. He's got friends. He's got game \u2013 maybe its not good game but he can at least talk to someone he\u2019s attracted to whereas Peter could barely manage that. I think he's more connected to the world that surrounds him. Peter Parker early on was a very reactive kind of character. That's part of how we understood teenagers back then, and I think we understand teenagers differently now. They're their own people with their own concerns and ways of moving through the world.\u201d", "Unfortunately, Miles' family has a dark and troubled history. Miles' father and uncle were once career criminals. Jefferson eventually reformed and married Miles\u2019 mother Rio. Unfortunately, Miles\u2019 uncle Aaron remained on a dark path and eventually became the supervillain known as the Prowler. Miles and his uncle Aaron fought a number of times as Spider-Man and Prowler before they two learned of their secret identities.", "Powers Miles has a spider physiology, which gives him the proportionate abilities of a spider. These powers are similar to Peter Parker\u2019s spider abilities but also different in a few notable ways. Superhuman Strength: capable of lifting at least 10 tons, can jump to a height of several stories in a single bound", "capable of lifting at least 10 tons, can jump to a height of several stories in a single bound Superhuman Speed: can run and move at speeds beyond the limits of Olympic athletes", "can run and move at speeds beyond the limits of Olympic athletes Superhuman Stamina: can physically exert himself for several hours before fatigue sets in", "can physically exert himself for several hours before fatigue sets in Superhuman Durability: Miles' body is physically resistant to some types of injury and can withstand great impacts", "Miles' body is physically resistant to some types of injury and can withstand great impacts Superhuman Agility: enhanced agility, balance, flexibility, and bodily coordination", "enhanced agility, balance, flexibility, and bodily coordination Wall-Crawling: can cling to any wall or ceiling using his fingertips and feet", "can cling to any wall or ceiling using his fingertips and feet Spider-Sense: an internal buzz alerts Miles\u2019 to incoming dangers, offering close to near-complete awareness of surroundings", "an internal buzz alerts Miles\u2019 to incoming dangers, offering close to near-complete awareness of surroundings Bio-Electrokinesis: unlike Peter, Miles can control the natural electricity of his body, which can be weaponized, sending bio-electric shocks to enemies with a touch. These attacks take several forms (such as Venom blast and Venom punch) and can also be used to destroy technology", "unlike Peter, Miles can control the natural electricity of his body, which can be weaponized, sending bio-electric shocks to enemies with a touch.

There are comic characters who were created decades ago who haven\u2019t had the same cultural impact. Miles star bloomed even larger after the release of the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which some consider the best superhero film ever made.", "The same year as Into the Spider-Verse, Insomniac released its hit game based on Spider-Man. While that game focused on Peter\u2019s adventures, the team at Insomniac was also excited by Miles and eager to work with the character. Now the studio is on the cusp of making Miles the star of his very own game. Spider-Man: Miles Morales picks up the story after Miles has been training with Peter for several months. However, when Peter tells Miles that he\u2019ll be leaving town for a few weeks, Miles understands that he\u2019ll be New York\u2019s only Spider-Man, which is no small task. We can\u2019t wait to see how Miles rises to this challenge just like he\u2019s risen to assume all of the responsibilities that come with the name Spider-Man in the comics. Miles' story has tugged on the heartstrings for years, and we can\u2019t wait to see what the next decade brings.", "Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales releases on November 12 for the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
