But the dish is not difficult to make\u2014after all, it involves zero cooking. In fact, making a batch doesn\u2019t require much more than a butcher you trust, a very sharp knife, clean hands, and freezingly cold bowls and plates.", "Tartare is served \u201cdressed\u201d with any number of possible sauces, which are enlivening and essential, but the dish is obviously all about the meat: you want the best, most vibrantly delicious beef you can find. The cut? A lean one, but the cut is less important than the quality. Riad Nasr, of the restaurant Frenchette, who, during his time as a chef at Balthazar and Minetta Tavern, might well have sold more steak tartare than any other individual in the history of New York City meat eating, makes his from whatever is at hand. \u201cFilet is good,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut really anything goes if the meat is beautiful and fresh.\u201d Top round, eye of round, heart, strip. The color is important (bright, intensely red), as is the firmness of the tissue. And the smell should be appetizing, the healthy aromatics of a beneficently raised animal: grass-fed, if possible\u2014a creature that has lived and roamed in the open air. You want to be happy sticking your nose into it. I once did a stint in the Tuscan butcher shop of the celebrated and flamboyant carnivore Dario Cecchini, where the senior butcher\u2014\u201cil Maestro\u201d\u2014assessed his beef by slicing off a piece raw and chewing it slowly and reflectively. Raw, the meat revealed to him the animal\u2019s diet, its exercise, and its health. When it was good, the Maestro smiled. This, his smile conveyed, was the flavor of sunshine and green grass and nature.", "Our palates tell us everything, Cecchini told me recently, \u201cfrom the animal\u2019s birth to the moment of this raw slice, including if it had an honest death.\u201d By way of example, I got lucky in my tartare experiments, which were conducted this last summer when I was in Maine with my family, owing to a savvy local butcher, Anders Tallberg, at Maine Street Meats, in Rockport. Tallberg prides himself on his local farm animals (like the seven- to eight-year-old dairy cows from Springdale Farm), and sells meat that is so flavorful and healthy and popular that his customers have to order it a week in advance. Tallberg and I discussed, and experimented with, different cuts for a tartare. My favorite, I admit, was the tenderloin (which is almost banal in its obviousness), largely because it hadn\u2019t been aged for more than ten days. You age meat for reasons of flavor development and tenderness. And, in New York at least, there seems to be an unofficial can-you-top-me competition among butchers to see who is prepared to age theirs the longest, as if to prove one\u2019s commitment to taste over cash flow. But in a dish made of raw meat? You want fresh.", "Raw meat, like raw fish, is a quiet food. It presents few contrasts on the palate\u2014no burnt and rare, nothing caramelized, no rendered fat, no crunch. Its appeal, instead, is in how the meat\u2019s flavors linger in the mouth, akin to how a good wine is sometimes said to have \u201clength.\u201d The Italians, respecting the subtlety of those flavors, prepare their raw beef like a plate of crudo\u2014with olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, a lot of salt, maybe an herb leaf. What the French do is much more interestingly aggressive. When waiters prepare a tartare for you tableside, they can seem as though they\u2019re just making it up with whatever bottle they have nearby: a big spoon of mustard, a splash of Tabasco, an egg yolk, a little olive oil (because why not?), capers, Worcestershire (which the French, unable to pronounce, always refer to as a \u201csauce anglaise\u201d), even ketchup. Maybe there\u2019s an analogy in Japanese preparations of raw fish, another quiet food. Yes, you can honor it by dressing it delicately, or you can summon all the condiments on offer and attack it with intensifiers: Soy! Wasabi! Spicy ginger!", "The French approach is in the peculiar word \u201cTartar,\u201d historically a Western noun to describe a Central Asian population and the empires of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane. Today, in cooking, we use the word to describe cutting up a raw ingredient with a knife, whether meat, fish (tartare de saumon, tartare de thon), or even vegetables. But it originally referred to a sauce, an early intensifier. According to Joseph Favre (1849-1903), the Swiss-born chef and a culinary theoretician who produced one of the great reference books of the French kitchen (the four-volume Grand dictionnaire Universel de cuisine pratique), sauce \u00e0 la tartare was a common accompaniment to foods that were breaded and fried\u2014an exotic-seeming preparation popular in France in the early nineteenth century, having come from the East, from some central Asian culture \u201cover there somewhere\u201d: i.e., those \u201cTartar\u201d people. By 1894, Favre recognizes that the Tartars had nothing to do with either the sauce or the preparation, which, by then, was described as coming from Poland\u2014\u00e0 la polonaise. But, by then, the name sauce \u00e0 la tartare had stuck.", "The sauce, made with a base of a Dijon-mustard mayonnaise, isn\u2019t so different from the fish-and-chips dressing that descended from it, that mass-produced dipping cream that comes in plastic tubs with snap-on lids that I enjoyed last summer with my haddock, which, as it happens, was also breaded and fried. But a handmade tartare, which I learned to do when living in Lyon with my family, is a revelation: it has bite and texture and a wonderfully acidic punch. The mayonnaise is whisked by hand and not a blender, then enhanced, at the end, with equal parts chopped shallots, capers, and cornichons. In the French kitchen, a sauce of this kind is described as relev\u00e9e, from the verb lever, to elevate; the prefix re- adds emphasis. A sauce relev\u00e9e heightens the dish it is added to; it is extra elevated. I first learned the word from my son George, who took up ballet in Lyon and continued to dance in studios in New York, where the word relever refers not merely to rising up on his toes, but really rising up. (The opposite term, plier, to bend, is also a cooking word: it describes how you fold dough when making puff pastry.)", "Many of the raw-beef preparations that you get in New York City are made with variations of a sauce tartare, plus a couple of the \u201cmodern condiments.\u201d The raw beef that I ate twenty-five years ago at Les Halles, on Park Avenue, was made (though I didn\u2019t know it at the time) by a man who would become a friend, Tony Bourdain, who prepared his with a classic sauce tartare, plus a little hot sauce. The one my wife and I ate recently, under quarantine conditions, at Pastis downtown, was also classic\u2014plus a little ketchup.", "For my purposes, I wanted a throwback taste, a flavor of turn-of-the-century bistros, with gas lights and mirrors and a hand-written menu\u2014no American ketchup, or English sauces, or Mexican chilis. I made a classic sauce \u00e0 la tartare. I folded it into the meat, adding nothing else except salt and pepper.", "Frederick, George\u2019s twin brother, eyed the final preparation uncomfortably. He loves steak tartare but doesn\u2019t like it with a sauce. It\u2019s the raw meat he likes, iron-red, uncompromisingly itself. Also, until this moment, his tartares had been prepared out of view, in a restaurant kitchen somewhere. This one had been made in the open by his father. Frederick was suspicious.", "I gave him a spoon. \u201cTry it,\u201d I said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not red,\u201d he said, warily, which was true: the beef\u2019s earlier vibrant color had been dulled by the sauce to a not entirely appealing pink.", "He slipped his spoon into the mound of meat and carved out the smallest of small bits. He looked at me. \u201cWill it make me sick?\u201d", "\u201cProbably not.\u201d", "\u201cProbably not?\u201d", "He tasted it. \u201cWow!\u201d and he instantly dipped his spoon back into the meat, deeply. The rest of us joined him, one by one (George, ever cautious, was last), and we remained there, at the counter, eating, standing up. The raw meat, the subtle fat, the prickly acidities of the sauce, the pure flavor. It was raw but also, surprisingly, better than raw. It wasn\u2019t the best-looking tartare I\u2019ve eaten, but it was certainly among the best-tasting. Was it the meat or the sauce? Or simply that I was eating it with my family? It was transporting in every sense. It took us all to another place, another time.
