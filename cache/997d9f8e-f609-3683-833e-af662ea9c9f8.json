The stylist behind Justin Bieber, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Sarah Paulson already runs a creative agency, a clothing line, and an underwear start-up, but Welch continues to embark on new endeavors. Her latest project, Stella x Karla, puts a fresh twist on athleisure for a great cause. Each product sold goes to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit dedicated to preventing pollution and expanding clean energy. Even with her other commitments, Welch didn\u2019t require much convincing to take on the project. \u201cI love that they let us have crazy ideas and help us raise money for great organizations,\u201d she shared via email. \u201cIt\u2019s as easy as that.\u201d", "Welch first joined forces with Stella Artois in 2019, by creating merchandise tied to its Super Bowl LIV celebration. She\u2019s since continued the collaboration during quarantine by hosting a series of weekly Instagram Live events to raise money for the millions of hospitality workers who lost their jobs during the crisis. The experience of making these virtual happy hours was nonstop fun. \u201cWhen the pandemic began, we teamed up on digital Happy Hour, where we chatted with some of my favorite peeps and raised a bunch of money for restaurant workers. I had so much fun doing it,\u201d says Welch, who brought in pals like Busy Philipps and Brandon Maxwell along for fun. \u201cDid I get drunk? Yes. Yes, I did.\u201d", "Naturally, when the Stella Artois team began brainstorming ideas for its first clothing capsule, she was the first person they called. Welch created a series of hoodies, T-shirts, and sweatpants inspired by the snapshots her family in Canada would send to her after their video calls, featuring the ombr\u00e9 shades of an autumn sunset. \u201cIt may sound cheesy, but [those pictures] gave me such comfort. It can be super easy to feel like we\u2019re all individually going through this alone,\u201d says Welch. \u201cNo matter how great the distance from loved ones or how insurmountable and isolating this pandemic can make an individual feel, in reality, we\u2019re all having a globally shared experience, under the same sky.\u201d Instead of just utilizing the color palette of a sunset, she and partner Matthew Welch drove down to California\u2019s Joshua Tree National Park to capture a truly brilliant one.", "With prices ranging from $18 for a bandana to $98 for a brushed-fleece hoodie, the line is accessible and ideal for lounging around the house. It\u2019s an effortless way for Welch to give back and bring a sense of cheer to days spent working from home. \u201cI think they are supercute and comfy, and I hope they make the wearer (and the viewer) smile,\u201d she says, adding that the print can be carried from head to toe. \u201cWe\u2019re in a pandemic\u2014go crazy with your style!\u201d On paper, the union of a beer brand and stylist may seem unusual, but after a successful web series and a new clothing collaboration, Welch plans to continue the partnership. \u201cI have always been obsessed with beer merch, so it\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d she says. \u201cNow they just need to let me near their bottle label!\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["yes", "workers", "clothing", "stella", "project", "sunsetinspired", "welch", "great", "money", "capsule", "series", "fun", "karla", "collection"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
