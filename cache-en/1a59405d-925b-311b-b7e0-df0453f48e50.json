These styles are also available as Trainer and Energy cards, which assist Pok\u00e9mon of the corresponding style to allow you to build decks centered around Single Strike or Rapid Strike.", "The new Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield \u2013 Battle Styles expansion introduces this gameplay mechanic, bringing 60 Battle Style cards, 12 Pok\u00e9mon V cards, 16 full-art Pok\u00e9mon V cards, 6 Pok\u00e9mon VMAX cards, 19 Trainer cards, 6 full-art Supporter cards, and 2 Special Energy cards.
