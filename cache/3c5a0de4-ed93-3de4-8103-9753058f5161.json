They are accusing his ministry of an \u201cegregious and widespread failure to comply with legal duties and established policies\u201d.", "The group is warning of a \u201ctransparency gap\u201d and is pushing for an independent judge-led inquiry into the billions spent on personal protective equipment, medicines and virus testing and tracing since the pandemic began.", "In a legal filing in the case, dated 30 October, government lawyers revealed that \u00a317bn had been spent by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on Covid-related goods and services since the start of the financial year in April. However, to date civil servants in Hancock\u2019s ministry have only released details of \u00a312.4bn in Covid-related contracts for that period \u2013 leaving \u00a34.6bn unaccounted for.", "The gap narrowed last week after the department rushed out details of \u00a31.6bn in contracts. Many of the new deals are for the purchase of rapid test kits of the kind being used in Liverpool\u2019s city-wide testing effort.", "Government departments are required by law to publish details of contracts no later than 30 days after awarding them. The measures are designed to reduce the risk of fraud and improve value for money by allowing proper scrutiny of how taxpayer cash is spent.", "Notices alerting the public to awards over a certain value by publicly funded bodies appear on a European database, Tenders Electronic Daily, and on the UK\u2019s own Contracts Finder website.", "Meanwhile, government guidance advises civil servants to publish the contracts themselves within 20 days.", "\u201cThere is overwhelming evidence that entities connected to key government figures have made staggering fortunes from these procurement contracts,\u201d said Jolyon Maugham, founder of the Good Law Project. \u201cThere is a clear public interest in us knowing promptly, whilst those contracts can still be challenged, who benefited and to the tune of how much.\u201d", "Among last week\u2019s notices is the largest Covid-related purchase so far by DHSC. The ministry has signed a \u00a3496m deal with Innova Medical, which is supplying lateral flow kits. The devices look and work like pregnancy tests, and are made in China for Innova.", "An earlier contract with Innova cost the taxpayer \u00a3107m. The California-based company is owned by the private equity group Pasaca Capital, which was founded by a Chinese investment banker in 2017.", "Whether the deals are value for money remains in question. It is not yet known whether the tests can detect the virus in pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic people, and the government has not published its data on trials of the kits.", "Good Law\u2019s claim singles out a number of cases, including the award of a \u00a3252m PPE contract to a company called Ayanda Capital on 29 April. Notice of the award was not published on the European database until 2 July. The contract itself was not published until 4 September. Ayanda, which describes itself as specialising in currency trading and offshore property, secured the deal with the help of an associate who was previously an adviser to the government.", "The legal challenge also names Pestfix, a pest control business, which has signed 11 PPE contracts with the government. So far, only six have been published.", "Government lawyers have defended the delays, admitting \u201ctechnical breaches\u201d of the law, but saying the information will be made public \u201cin due course\u201d. They say any legal action risks delaying publication.", "The DHSC said it could not comment on legal proceedings, adding: \u201cAs part of an unprecedented response to this global pandemic we have drawn on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners. This is completely in line with procurement regulations for exceptional circumstances.", "\u201cWe have been clear from the outset that public authorities must achieve value for taxpayers and use good commercial judgement. Publication of contract information is being carried out as quickly as possible in line with government transparency guidelines.\u201d", "Spending watchdog the National Audit Office has prepared a report on government procurement during the pandemic. It is understood the report is with DHSC for factchecking and due to be released this month.", "\u201cIt\u2019s astounding that there could be a gap this big between what the government spent and what it has told the public it paid,\u201d said Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves. \u201cThere has been a whole catalogue of contracts that are either opaque, wasteful, unaccountable, or linked to Tory friends and donors. It\u2019s little wonder that trust in the government\u2019s handling of public contracts is dropping like a stone.\u201d", "The gap between the value of contracts awarded and the value of those published has been caused by delays in meeting the 30-day deadline. Research firm Tussell, which was commissioned by Good Law to monitor contract notices, said Covid-related awards are taking an average of 78 days to appear, compared with 41 days for non-Covid awards.", "\u201cWhile the Department of Health has published \u00a312.4bn of Covid-response contracts, we know this is still not the full picture of its spending to date,\u201d said Tussell founder, Gus Tugendhat. \u201cIt may be that the lag in publishing is even greater than that reported here.\u201d"], "authors": ["Juliette Garside"], "keywords": ["public", "covidrelated", "published", "publish", "private", "4bn", "group", "value", "fails", "firms", "contracts", "covid", "contract", "legal", "uk", "details", "gap", "law"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
