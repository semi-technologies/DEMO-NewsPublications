Despite the nearly universal acclaim that the novel had received, critics had trouble deciding whether the PowerPoint was a dazzling, avant-garde innovation or, as one reviewer described it, \u201ca wacky literary gimmick,\u201d a cheap trick that diminished the over-all value of the novel. In an interview with Egan, the novelist Heidi Julavits confessed to dreading the chapter before she read it, and then experiencing a happy relief once she had. \u201cI live in fear of the gimmicky story that fails to rise above its gimmick,\u201d she said. \u201cBut within a few pages I totally forgot about the PowerPoint presentation, that\u2019s how ungimmicky your gimmick was.\u201d", "The word \u201cgimmick\u201d is believed to come from \u201cgimac,\u201d an anagram of \u201cmagic.\u201d The word was likely first used by magicians, gamblers, and swindlers in the nineteen-twenties to refer to the props they wielded to attract, and to misdirect, attention\u2014and sometimes, according to \u201cThe Wise-Crack Dictionary,\u201d from 1926, to turn \u201ca fair game crooked.\u201d From such duplicitous beginnings, the idea of gimmickry soon spread. In Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s novel \u201cInvitation to a Beheading,\u201d from 1935, a mother distracts her imprisoned son from counting the hours to his execution by describing the \u201cmarvelous gimmicks\u201d of her childhood. The most shocking, she explains, was a trick mirror. When \u201cshapeless, mottled, pockmarked, knobby things\u201d were placed in front of the mirror, it would reflect perfectly sensible forms: flowers, fields, ships, people. When confronted with a human face or hand, the mirror would reflect a jumble of broken images. As the son listens to his mother describe her gimmick, he sees her eyes spark with terror and pity, \u201cas if something real, unquestionable (in this world, where everything was subject to question), had passed through, as if a corner of this horrible life had curled up, and there was a glimpse of the lining.\u201d Behind the mirror lurks something monstrous\u2014an idea of art as device, an object whose representational powers can distort and devalue just as easily as they can estrange and enchant.", "Trick mirrors are gimmicks, but they are also metaphors for how gimmicks work, eliciting both charm and suspicion. In \u201cA Visit from the Goon Squad,\u201d Egan transforms a clunky corporate technology into an ingenious storytelling technique by embedding it in the older technology of the novel. Seen in this context, the PowerPoint\u2019s history as a management tool begins to vanish behind the story of a young girl\u2019s life\u2014the novelist\u2019s version of the magician\u2019s final act, when he folds his assistant in a trunk and makes her disappear. Teetering between novelty and banality, Egan\u2019s novel manages to squeeze a drop of wonder out of a crude communication method. Yet its single-use success\u2014no other writer could get away with repeating her trick\u2014reminds us that the literary marketplace, as Theodor Adorno once observed of the art world, favors \u201cwork with a \u2018personal touch,\u2019 or more bluntly, a gimmick.\u201d", "The seductive wonders of Nabokov\u2019s mirror or Egan\u2019s PowerPoint are harder to find in the gimmicks of the present. Recent headlines offer up a wide range of gimmicks rushed into production to contain the spread of the coronavirus (robot chefs, antiviral cars), as well as products and ideas whose sudden obsolescence (\u201cfun\u201d workplaces, airline miles) reveals that they were gimmicks all along. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to veto the National Defense Authorization Act, in order to stop Confederate names being removed from military bases; Kanye West\u2019s announcement of his Presidential run; and Amazon\u2019s new surveillance drone, the Ring Always Home Cam, have attracted scorn as \u201cgimmicks\u201d\u2014promotional shticks, dangerous stunts. Why is a word used to describe a literary technique also the word used to describe the buffoonery, the cruelty and carelessness, of contemporary political and economic life? What is in a word as minor as \u201cgimmick\u201d?", "\u201cNo way! It\u2019s your turn. I got whacked all day yesterday.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Mick Stevens", "For Sianne Ngai, a professor of English at the University of Chicago and the author of \u201cTheory of the Gimmick\u201d (Harvard), the answer is: everything, or at least everything to do with the art consumed and produced under capitalism. One of the most original literary scholars at work today, Ngai has made a career of unravelling the social and political histories that shape our aesthetic judgments (\u201cHow beautiful! How hideous!\u201d) of novels, films, and photographs, as well as of show tunes and YouTube videos, bath toys and smiley faces. Her work draws attention to the public dimensions of apparently private reactions to art, and to the world in which these aesthetic experiences arise\u2014a \u201ccapitalist lifeworld,\u201d she writes, where art is increasingly trivial and artifice reigns supreme, where fun and fright merge to create the same arresting, alienating magic as Nabokov\u2019s mirror.", "Ngai\u2019s first scholarly book, \u201cUgly Feelings,\u201d published in 2005, examined a set of negative emotions\u2014irritation, envy, paranoia, anxiety\u2014that she described as \u201cminor and generally unprestigious\u201d compared with the \u201cgrander passions\u201d of love, anger, and sympathetic uplift, which have historically animated so much of art and literature. The passivity and inscrutability of these ugly feelings, which Ngai tracked in works from \u201cBartleby, the Scrivener\u201d to \u201cSingle White Female,\u201d offered a frustrated response to the sense of limited agency\u2014to living and working, especially as a woman or a nonwhite person, in a \u201chighly differentiated and totally commodified world.\u201d Her next book, \u201cOur Aesthetic Categories: Zany, Cute, Interesting\u201d (2012), placed the three ambivalent assessments in its subtitle at the heart of aesthetic theory, arguing that they best captured the nature of aesthetic experience in \u201cthe hypercommodified, information-saturated, performance-driven conditions of late capitalism.\u201d The cuteness of a sculpture by Takashi Murakami, for instance, fetishized the helpless; the zaniness enacted by Lucille Ball or Richard Pryor showcased the incessant activity of a person who was always working.", "Although Ngai\u2019s books are conceptually and philosophically dense, their appeal comes from how they tap into our ordinary use of language. Unless I collect art, or live in a many-windowed house at the edge of a westerly peninsula, where the sea is gilded by the sun and silvered by the moon, I am unlikely to have regular encounters with things I would call \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201csublime,\u201d and I may well find the rush and roar of such Romantic descriptions embarrassing. But not a day goes by when I do not call something\u2014my son\u2019s stuffed animals, a dress, a poem by Gertrude Stein\u2014\u201ccute,\u201d or a novel or an essay \u201cinteresting.\u201d And I can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve called a kitchen gizmo my husband swears we really, really need (but we really, really don\u2019t) or a colleague\u2019s online persona \u201cgimmicky.\u201d \u201cTheory of the Gimmick\u201d finds in the pervasiveness of the gimmick the same duelling forces of aesthetic attraction and repulsion that shape all Ngai\u2019s work. \u201c \u2018You want me,\u2019 the gimmick outrageously says,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is never entirely wrong.\u201d", "As with all aesthetic judgments, calling something a gimmick begins simply, with a feeling of pleasure or displeasure, or some uncertain mingling of the two. Consider the pandemic-era robot chef: behind its flashiness and the obvious expense of producing it, behind the hypnotic slicing and dicing of its hands, I sense its fraudulence. No doubt it will underperform, cooking meals only as well as a Roomba cleans a house. No doubt it will occasion gruesome comic mishaps\u2014say, if the cat tries riding it. None of this needs to be explained; I know a gimmick when I see one. My judgment is elicited by my perception of what Ngai identifies as the gimmick\u2019s defining feature: \u201cdubious yet attractive promises about the saving of time, the reduction of labor, and the expansion of value.\u201d", "Although my calling something a gimmick registers a subjective response, it also demands agreement or invites confrontation, and more brazenly so than other judgments. Should a fan of robot chefs and Roombas question why I harbor such unwarranted suspicions about them, I will feel compelled to convince him that my suspicions ought to be felt universally. But I will also delight in a newfound sense of superiority, my belief that only I am discerning enough to see that these devices are overvalued, too good to be true. Every gimmick, Ngai tells us, needs a dupe. For every skeptic, there must be a person, or an entire market society, who will affirm the value of what the skeptic judges to be\u2014in the words of Ron Padgett\u2019s poem \u201cGimmicks\u201d\u2014\u201ccheap, tricky, fast, without substance, even immoral.\u201d", "For Ngai, the problem of the gimmick\u2014the mismatch between how it appears and the value it creates\u2014is also the fundamental problem of capitalism as explained by Karl Marx. In \u201cCapital,\u201d Marx tells the story of capital\u2019s relation to value with the help of a gimmicky character he introduces as \u201cour friend, Moneybags.\u201d Moneybags is an \u201cembryo capitalist\u201d\u2014no mustache, no top hat yet\u2014looking for a special commodity to buy, one whose consumption will create value, allowing him to make money from money. Luckily, Moneybags meets a worker. He buys the worker\u2019s \u201clabor-power\u201d by paying him a wage, sells whatever product the worker makes, and appropriates the difference between the two\u2014what Marx calls \u201csurplus-value\u201d\u2014as profit. That, at least, is how capitalist relations appear in the market, \u201cthe noisy sphere, where everything takes place on the surface and in view of men.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t lift weights. I got this way because I wipe down the equipment really, really hard.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Drew Dernavich", "But when Marx accompanies Moneybags into \u201cthe hidden abode of production,\u201d he draws back the glittering green curtain on wage and profit, exposing how value is created: the exploitation of labor. Though Moneybags requires his worker to labor for twelve hours a day to earn his wage, the worker needs only six of those hours to produce his means of subsistence: the daily cost of the food, clothing, and housing he needs to replenish his \u201cmuscle, nerve, brain\u201d and reproduce his labor-power. In the six hours he works beyond that, \u201che creates no value for himself,\u201d Marx writes. \u201cHe creates surplus-value which, for the capitalist, has all the charms of a creation out of nothing.\u201d The wage makes all labor performed during the workday appear as if it were compensated labor, when, in fact, half of it is not. Cloaked by the \u201cmagic and necromancy\u201d of money, capital\u2019s \u201ctrick\u201d is its command of unpaid labor and time to create value. Behind the appealing illusion of free, happy exchange sits a hollow and untrustworthy reality, a gimmick.", "Leaning long and hard on Marx, Ngai argues that the capitalist\u2019s boundless quest to increase surplus labor prompts him to find new ways of enhancing his trick. He turns to \u201cthe magic of machinery,\u201d Marx writes\u2014not just one machine but a system of machines, \u201ca mechanical monster whose body fills whole factories, and whose demon power . . . at length breaks out into the fast and furious whirl of his countless working organs.\u201d These contrivances intensify capital\u2019s gimmick by increasing the efficiency of labor-power, eking out more work from the same twelve-hour day. Yet intensifying labor also makes it redundant\u2014the same number of laborers can, with less work, convert an ever-expanding quantity of raw materials into products. The devices designed to make capitalism\u2019s trick slicker contain the seeds of the contradiction that drives it to crisis: they also eliminate labor, and along with it the surplus-value on which capital depends.", "According to Ngai, calling something a gimmick indicates our discomfort with capitalism\u2019s sneaky distortion of the relationship between value, labor, and time. The gimmick is both an aesthetic and an economic judgment. Think back to Egan\u2019s PowerPoint. Compared with the intricacy of the rest of her novel, the PowerPoint seems like a mechanical shortcut\u2014what Ngai would call a \u201clabor-saving trick,\u201d and what a critic or a creative-writing professor might describe as \u201cunearned.\u201d At the same time, the PowerPoint appears to be working too hard to get our attention. The ambivalence about whether the PowerPoint is, as the clich\u00e9 goes, working hard or hardly working becomes even more telling when we learn that its design was outsourced to an unpaid worker: Egan\u2019s sister, a consultant, who, as Egan reveals, \u201cmade the graphs in the chapter for me because I couldn\u2019t seem to crunch the numbers competently.\u201d", "The female family member who volunteers her labor recalls Rosey, the robot maid in \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d perennially unpaid and verging on obsolescence, as well as the trio of strippers from the Broadway show \u201cGypsy,\u201d who, as Ngai reminds us, sing \u201cYou Gotta Get a Gimmick.\u201d Why do gimmicks so often feature a woman performing undervalued labor? In a memorable moment in James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses,\u201d Leopold Bloom recalls suggesting to his former boss, a stationer, that he could drum up business by placing in front of his store \u201ca transparent show cart with two smart girls inside writing. . . . Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she\u2019s writing.\u201d Bloom\u2019s gimmick grabs attention by conflating sex with intellectual labor and, in the process, devaluing both. The smart girls may be paid to sit there, but they are not paid for the writing they do or for men to ogle them. \u201cHave a finger in the pie. Women too,\u201d Bloom boasts, hinting that business and sex might be dispensed by the same gimmick.", "For Ngai, no novelist knows this dynamic better than Helen DeWitt, who draws sexual and intellectual labor together with zany brilliance in \u201cLightning Rods.\u201d DeWitt\u2019s sleazy hero, Joe, proposes to solve the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace by founding a temp agency staffed by women who provide male employees with on-site sex, stopping them from harassing full-time employees. He also comes up with a gimmick, the Lightning Rod: a contraption that divides a woman in half, like the magician sawing his lovely assistant in two. Her front half performs intellectual labor\u2014reading Proust, applying to law school\u2014while her back end, Ngai explains, protrudes \u201cthrough a hidden door into a bathroom stall for the male user to fuck.\u201d Once Joe has cornered the market on sex, he persuades his clients to outsource all their temporary hiring to his company, also called Lightning Rods.", "The comedy of DeWitt\u2019s gimmick\u2014a woman embedded in a machine embedded in a sex service embedded in a temp agency\u2014confirms the depressing reality of those whom capitalism exploits most ruthlessly: women. It\u2019s not just that women\u2019s labor in the workplace is increasingly contingent and precarious; women are also disproportionately responsible for many forms of unwaged labor\u2014domestic work, child rearing, arguably even sex. \u201cCapitalism\u2019s ultimate labor-saving device is just simply a woman,\u201d Ngai concludes, for women are \u201cthe permanently transient, cheaper labor used to further cheapen labor in general.\u201d", "Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Carol Lay", "Until around the end of the Renaissance, Ngai suggests, aesthetic devices we might now find gimmicky\u2014the pneumatic heads in \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d the talking animal spirits in Margaret Cavendish\u2019s \u201cThe Blazing World,\u201d the deus ex machina in theatre\u2014were received without suspicion. \u201cDevices like these were wonders, not in any way equivocal,\u201d Ngai writes. They made \u201cno particular claim to abbreviating work on which they could henceforth renege.\u201d The capitalist gimmick, by contrast, \u201cis both a wonder and a trick. It is a form we marvel at and distrust, admire and disdain.\u201d And it often arrives overloaded with unearned praise, wrongful or embarrassing hyperbole that one feels compelled to take down a notch.", "Perhaps the earliest accusation of literary gimmickry was made by Samuel Johnson. In 1775, during a meeting of the Literary Club, he attacked Jonathan Swift\u2019s \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels,\u201d declaring, \u201cWhen once you have thought of big men and little men, it is very easy to do all the rest.\u201d It is telling that his criticism hinges on the idea of ease. Swift\u2019s trick of scale let him avoid the hard work that Johnson believed was a novelist\u2019s duty, making him instead the kind of writer who, as Johnson wrote elsewhere, scribbled \u201cwithout the Toil of Study, without Knowledge of Nature, or Acquaintance with Life.\u201d The high-concept premise of \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels\u201d was a shortcut, a con by which Swift could smuggle in tired social satire, using fantastic creatures, instead of ordinary humans, as mouthpieces for his ideas.", "From here, one could see the history of prose fiction as a series of allegations of gimmickry\u2014of writers\u2019 and critics\u2019 cutting down their predecessors\u2019 sleights, puncturing the inflated plaudits they had garnered. To the narrator of Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cEmma,\u201d sentimental romances, like the ones Emma imagines herself in and that Austen\u2019s novels ironize, turn on coded letters, word games, and other vehicles \u201cfor gallantry and trick.\u201d Both romance and realism, according to G. K. Chesterton, were \u201ctricks and tricks alone,\u201d and he railed against the \u201ctechnical dodges\u201d of realists such as Charles Dickens and Gustave Flaubert. \u201cIt is a trick to make a heroine, in the act of accepting a lover, suddenly aureoled by a chance burst of sunshine, and then to call it romance,\u201d Chesterton wrote. \u201cBut it is quite as much of a trick to make her, in the act of accepting a lover, drop her umbrella, or trip over a hassock, and then call it the bold plain realism of life.\u201d Gimmickier still, to Henry James, was the novelist who menaced a beautiful young woman with illness or death, \u201cthe very shortest of all cuts to the interesting state.\u201d James\u2019s late works, which Ngai considers at length, threaten women with something different: the corny insinuations, or verbal gimmicks, of men who refuse to acknowledge the care and sexual attention that women have given them."], "authors": ["Merve Emre", "Merve Emr"], "keywords": ["gimmick", "gimmicks", "work", "value", "lovehate", "trick", "powerpoint", "ngai", "aesthetic", "novel", "relationship", "labor"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
