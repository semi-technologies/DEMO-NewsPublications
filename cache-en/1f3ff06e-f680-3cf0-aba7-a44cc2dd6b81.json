Crenshaw pushed back on republican infighting over voting in Georgia runoff Senate Races. Saying,", "\"We need to be on message on this. We need to get out and vote. All right. I don't want to hear any childish, I'm going to take my ball and go home because I'm upset. I want you to get out and vote. I don't want to hear it. You know, we need to we need to talk to people like they're adults because they are adults. And, you know, I share those concerns. You need to get out and vote. Your vote counts. Are there problems with these elections that we've seen? Yes. And I've been bringing it up for months, you know, and that was the time to bring it up. We've seen holding in a lot of the processes and a lot of states for a while. I've been pointing them out. The expansion of mail and voting such an exceptional degree becomes impossible to know whether the process is secure or not. OK, that's certainly an issue. The main issue for Republicans going forward across, especially at the state level where the stuff get decided, but do not take that to mean that you shouldn't go out and vote. And that is some kind of protest that you're really showing the people in charge when you when you abstain from this election. That is nonsense. Don't do it, it's childish, You need to get out and vote.\""], "authors": ["Wyatt Dobrovichfago"], "keywords": ["seen", "vote", "rtx", "need", "races", "weve", "dont", "crenshaw", "republicans", "voting", "ga", "runoff", "rep", "know", "senate"], "pubDate": "2020-12-02T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
