Three years later, she was on the cover of Anna Wintour\u2019s first September issue, the first Black woman to do so. \u201cAmerican Vogue, it was a symbol that you really made it as a model,\u201d Campbell says in her video.

And truly, when asked, I was quite surprised. I didn\u2019t say yes right away, as I really wanted to think about all that was going on in the world.\u201d Ultimately, she decided to accept the offer. As she explains, \u201cIt\u2019s a milestone of my age, as a woman today, and it\u2019s for my family, but more than anything, this cover is for my culture.\u201d", "And as for the magic that goes into creating such gorgeous photos as the ones by Ethan James Green for the issue?

Instead, she puts her trust in the photographers. \u201cAfter 34 years of modeling, I\u2019m always so excited to know how they will make me look next. It\u2019s always a thrill for me,\u201d she says.
