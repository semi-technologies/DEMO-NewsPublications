I stood outside the kitchen and watched her napping heavy under the drugs.", "She had seemed well\u2014healthy and alert, if morose\u2014up until a few weeks ago. At the start of the new year, my fiance\u00e9 Elettra and I left our Brooklyn apartment and moved in with her mother Joanie and her stepfather, who lived in a quiet Massachusetts suburb. The plan was to stay till our new house was built, a project Joanie had worried we were rushing into.", "Elettra and I had still only been dating when we bought the land, and though Joanie loved the overgrowth, the wildness of it, she had suggested wryly we might need to shop around for a backhoe. She also deemed it foolish, signing a mortgage with someone you were not married to. Dreams are oftentimes foolish. For as long as I could remember, I had wanted a place in the woods full of tattered books to be read for the hundredth time and soft, cuddly pets and without any schedules or demands. I didn\u2019t want to see any uninvited soul for days. Elettra wanted the same. We bought our 5-acre hideaway, and I proposed to Elettra on a craggy ledge backed by a brush-covered mountain. At our engagement party, which Joanie had been well enough to plan and attend that December, I told everyone the house would be ready in about nine months. As Elettra\u2019s family became my family, I figured we could wait out the construction together.", "Then one day in January, after we moved in, Joanie climbed into the hospital bed we had installed in the living room, and another kind of waiting began.", "I curled back around the corner into the kitchen, not wanting to stare, feeling like an outsider in Joanie\u2019s home and within the family she would soon leave.", "\u201cShe\u2019s asleep?\u201d", "\u201cThink so. Maybe dozing. Drink?\u201d I asked Joanie\u2019s youngest brother. He and several other siblings had come to visit Joanie when the prognosis of her cancer deteriorated from hopeful to terminal. They were now waiting around to say goodbye. My uncle-in-law had been surveying the dirty dishware in the kitchen sink. He helped with every fifth load.", "\u201cCourvoisier?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cRight. She\u2019s got it over here.\u201d", "We walked to the red liquor cabinet in the dining room, built by Joanie\u2019s father, and I poured him a finger.", "\u201cKeep going,\u201d he said.", "I poured two more.", "He raised the tumbler and caught my eye through the glass. He took a sip. Sober and without a liquid crutch, I had cooked meals and cleaned for the family for nearly a month, hoping to bind together a group that otherwise felt entropic. I was navigating a type of anticipated loss I knew nothing about while simultaneously asking such banal questions as, \u201cHow do you like it out there on the Cape?\u201d", "Having retreated into the roles of dishwasher, cook, cleaner, and jester, I was incredibly lonely. My wife was pulling away emotionally as I was struggling (and in my mind, failing) to take care of her and her family.", "\u201cHave you broken ground yet, over at the property?\u201d", "\u201cNot yet. Just closed on the land last month. Working to get a building permit. Absolute nightmare.\u201d Joanie liked our idea to use shipping containers to form the skeleton of our house, but I think she and everyone else were right in saying that building a house was never easy\u2014even if it was a somewhat prefabricated one.", "I insisted the project was sound. I can be unpleasantly, aggressively stubborn\u2014I\u2019ve cursed torque wrenches I felt were lying\u2014and all I wanted was for Joanie and her siblings to see the home built, our dreams realized, to see that I was right and our project wasn\u2019t some foolish gambit but something at which they\u2019d one day marvel."], "authors": ["Kenneth R.
