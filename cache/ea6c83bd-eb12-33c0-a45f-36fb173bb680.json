The campaign's got a team there, a legal team ready on the ground to make sure that votes are accurately counted and that we're adhering to the laws within the state. But it's always concerning when those who are tasked with objectively carrying, executing an election, really seem to be putting their thumb on the scale one direction or the other. But I can tell you this. We love Pennsylvania. We have been fighting for votes in Pennsylvania. The president's got a tremendous record on energy. You've got the Democrats, who on every side of it, they're for or against fracking and then supporting the ludicrous Green New Deal that would just crush Pennsylvania jobs. But you know what? There's a lot of parts to victory for the President as well. So we hope we win Pennsylvania. It would be an honor. But there's other routes as well.\""], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["day", "pa", "comments", "thumb", "votes", "election", "theres", "scale", "team", "really", "attorney", "trying", "win", "embed", "alyssa", "officials", "pennsylvania", "farah", "youve"], "pubDate": "2020-11-03T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
