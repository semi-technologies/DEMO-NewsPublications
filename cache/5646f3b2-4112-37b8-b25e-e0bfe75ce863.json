The session follows four tumultuous years that saw one death, a retirement, three pitched Senate confirmation battles, two new arrivals and, for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u201486 and the anchor of the court\u2019s liberal wing\u2014two cancer diagnoses. A bundle of hot-button controversies await the nine.", "Discrimination against gay and transgender people is on the docket on the justices\u2019 second day back. The question is whether the bar on discrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prevents an employer from disadvantaging employees on the basis of their gender identity or sexual orientation. Fewer than half the states have laws against sacking workers because they are gay or trans. Now the Supreme Court will decide if the federal civil-rights umbrella protects some 8.1m LGBT workers across America.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Gerald Bostock, a child advocate (welfare officer) in Georgia, was fired after joining a gay softball league. Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor in New York, was sacked after he told a customer he was gay. Mr Zarda died in 2014, but in 2018 he prevailed posthumously in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Sexual-orientation bias, the judges held, is \u201ca subset of sex discrimination\u201d, because it is based on notions about \u201chow persons of a certain sex can or should be\u201d. Mr Bostock\u2019s similar contention was rejected in the 11th Circuit, creating a split that the Supreme Court is this term stepping in to resolve.", "Transgender discrimination gets separate treatment in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. After six years as a funeral director in Michigan, Aimee (n\u00e9e Anthony) Stephens wrote to Thomas Rost, her boss, explaining that she planned to transition and would present herself as a woman at work. Two weeks later Mr Rost fired Ms Stephens. Failing to wear the suit and tie required of male employees and presenting as a woman would have a negative impact on his clients\u2019 \u201chealing process\u201d, Mr Rost\u2019s lawyers say, and the \u201coriginal public meaning\u201d of sex discrimination when Congress wrote Title VII in 1964 did not require transgender people to be treated according to their self-declared gender identity rather than their biological sex.", "A three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Mr Rost illegally discriminated against Ms Stephens, the panel held unanimously, by treating her differently from how he would have treated a female employee and by requiring her to conform to male stereotypes.", "The Trump administration has taken the employers\u2019 side in the Title VII cases\u2014contrary to the view of another arm of the federal government, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2014and will take part in oral arguments. The federal government has a more direct stake in two immigration disputes to be heard on November 12th. A reprise of a 2017 case asks whether a border-patrol agent can be sued for shooting and killing a Mexican boy across the southern border. The justices will also sort out a two-year-long fight over Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to wind down Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA , Barack Obama\u2019s programme granting relief to undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. Challengers and several courts have said the rollback was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d, in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act.", "A significant Second Amendment case involving a gun regulation in New York City is scheduled for argument on December 2nd. But after the Supreme Court said it would review the constitutionality of the law\u2014which prohibits New York City residents with firearms licences from taking their guns to the suburbs\u2014the rule was rescinded. The plaintiffs, anxious to fortify the individual \u201cright to bear arms\u201d, have implored the Supreme Court to keep the case on its docket. But New York says there is \u201cno ongoing injury\u201d to the aggrieved gun owners and no controversy left to adjudicate. On October 1st, when the justices meet privately to review reams of petitions that have piled up over the summer, they will discuss whether to scrap New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v City of New York or carry on as planned.", "Other notable cases among the 50 the justices have already agreed to hear include a driver\u2019s privacy row in Kansas; fallout from the 2013 \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal in New Jersey; and a church-state fight in Montana. Several budding petitions could make headlines, too. An immigration case that Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, says may have \u201csweeping ramifications\u201d asks if undocumented immigrants on American soil have a constitutional right to judicial review when being detained or deported. A case involving Louisiana abortion-clinic regulations nearly identical to rules the court struck down as an \u201cundue burden\u201d in 2016 gives the new conservative bloc a first swipe at pushing back abortion rights.", "According to Kate Shaw, a professor at Cardozo law school, \u201cit seems almost certain\u201d that the limits of presidential power will soon be another point of contention.
