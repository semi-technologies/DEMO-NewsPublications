If you\u2019re an investor hoping it will add to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, you\u2019ll need even more.", "In June, Facebook (ticker: FB) released its plans for the Libra digital currency. The new system, it hoped, would provide a viable alternative to the current global payments system\u2014and make its own platform even more valuable.", "Those goals didn\u2019t seem so farfetched because a who\u2019s who of payments heavyweights and major merchants were on its side. Lyft (LYFT), eBay (EBAY), Mastercard (MA), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Spotify Technology (SPOT), Visa (V), Uber Technologies (UBER), and private fintech company Stripe were all announced as founding members of the Libra Association.", "The fact that so many established players were working with Facebook made it possible to believe that Libra might withstand the political backlash that greeted it.", "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that Libra raised serious concerns. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the currency\u2019s money-laundering vulnerabilities \u201ca national security issue.\u201d The Facebook executive leading the Libra project, David Marcus, was called in front of Congress to receive a bipartisan tongue-lashing. France and Germany even got into the act by releasing a joint statement in September agreeing to block Libra from being launched.", "Now it seems that Facebook\u2019s putative partners are getting worried that Facebook is overmatched by regulators. PayPal said on Friday that it is withdrawing from the Libra Association, a move that Mastercard and Visa were also considering, according to The Wall Street Journal. (Facebook\u2019s Marcus tweeted that the list of Libra members would be \u201dformalized in the weeks to come.\u201d)", "Facebook declined to comment further. In a statement late Friday, Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, said, \u201cThe type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard. Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else. We\u2019re better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later.\u201d", "There\u2019s little reason for PayPal, Mastercard, and Visa to stick around. They have benefited tremendously from huge secular shifts in how people shop\u2014increasingly online and with cards. And they have navigated all the regulatory chicanes that are currently slowing Libra down.", "Newsletter Sign-up", "PayPal has seen its shares fall since it cut its revenue guidance when it reported second-quarter earnings. But its earnings guidance held fast, and the product-integration issues that led to the cut shouldn\u2019t eat into future quarters. As for Mastercard and Visa, there are hardly any two more durable earnings machines in global finance.", "Those three companies won\u2019t face many financial repercussions if they decide to let Facebook fight on without them. The companies that were initial partners in the Libra Association signed only nonbinding letters of intent. The companies would eventually kick in $10 million in funding but aren\u2019t on the hook for anything if they leave in relatively short order.", "Facebook, on the other hand, is yet another tech giant struggling to succeed in financial services, and its digital currency is teetering on the edge of irrelevance as it meets growing resistance from regulators and its own partners.", "By contrast, the earnings potential of companies like Mastercard, Visa, and PayPal look ever more durable and their relatively pricey valuations look ever more defensible. Shares of Visa trade for 28.1 times 12-month forward earnings, while Mastercard trades at 31.5 times and PayPal trades at 29.9 times. The S&P 500 trades at 16.5 times.", "For investors looking to tap into fintech\u2019s vast earnings potential, Mastercard, PayPal, and Visa look as attractive as ever. If you want one of the most scalable, cash-generating advertising businesses the world has ever seen\u2014but one that comes with a morass of privacy regulation and antitrust risk\u2014look to Facebook.", "This story has been updated to reflect comment from the Libra Association.", "Write to Ben Walsh at ben.walsh@barrons.com"], "url": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebooks-fintech-aspirations-grow-dim-as-powerful-partners-edge-away-from-its-libra-cryptocurrecy-51570237132?mod=hp_minor_pos16"}
