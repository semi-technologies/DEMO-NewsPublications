Beeld Eva Plevier", "In the early noughties I often used to go to London, where pub food was all the rage. Fish and chips, ham and pea soup, steak and kidney pie, bread and butter pudding, trifle: classic dishes crafted by chefs who\u2019d earned their spurs in more traditionally culinary settings.", "Ever since, I\u2019ve fantasised about taking over a brown caf\u00e9 and serving really good versions of eetcaf\u00e9 dishes. Sat\u00e9 met patat; sate kambing with the best fries you\u2019ve ever tasted; fresh lasagna; beautifully chargrilled steaks; unpretentious but stunningly good food in an average-looking kind of venue.", "Amsterdam style", "Two items that have found their way onto just about every Amsterdam eetcaf\u00e9 menu in the last few years are burrata and ceviche, rightly regarded as today\u2019s versions of caprese and carpaccio.", "I wasn\u2019t exactly fired up about the idea of going to a new caf\u00e9 whose name is a Dutchified version of \u201cceviche\u201d, but sometimes it\u2019s really nice to be proved wrong.", "On the evening of our visit to Sjefietsche, which is in De Pijp, it was raining bucketloads and we were glum and soaked to the skin. But a tall, friendly guy in a flat cap gave us such a warm, relaxed welcome that our gruelling bike ride was quickly forgotten.", "Corner caf\u00e9", "The interior of this street-corner caf\u00e9 was just as warm: dark colours, dim lighting, but immaculate. We sat at a two-top in the window and ordered cocktails: a maracuy\u00e1 sour and a pisco sour (both \u20ac10, both expertly prepared and refreshingly unsweet).", "The langoustines we chose on the server\u2019s recommendation were a minor miracle. They were a feast in their own right, a modern, au-gratin version of scampi, extremely fresh, flash-grilled on the outside and raw but not cold inside, the classic herbs replaced by chopped seaweed (\u20ac14). This is the stuff that dreams are made of.", "We obviously tried gamba and hamachi ceviches (\u20ac14 and \u20ac15), and both were magical. The shrimp and meat cuissons were perfect, and the citrus juice provided just the right degree of acidity to cook them, but without tasting bitter.", "It was very clever, and that\u2019s without the almost voluptuous, oh-so-exquisite garnish of sweetcorn, yellow pepper and red onion (for the gamba) and radish, avocado, and kumquat for the hamachi. If I have one criticism, it\u2019s that the fish and shrimps weren\u2019t given enough visual prominence, but they were cooked by someone who had their buying, preparation and flavours down to a T.", "The wine list was small, with lots of organic wines. We chose a glass of Orl\u00e9ans Blanc chardonnay that lacked length, and a very fine Adeneuer blanc de noir (both \u20ac6.50).", "We always eat more than the average visitor when reviewing for A matter of taste, but even then, we didn\u2019t want to miss out on the best fishcakes ever (\u20ac8 for four). They were fried ultra-crisp on the outside and soft, briny and airy on the inside, accompanied by a slice of lemon and smoked chilli mayonnaise: not chipotle, but a version made by the Mapuche Indians.", "Octopus tentacle", "For \u20ac19, we got a chunky, perfectly tenderized and grilled octopus tentacle \u2013 those crispy suckers! - with wonderful anchovy a\u00efoli and salsa verde from the Magimix. Its rich heartiness was perfectly counterbalanced by the acidity of the salsa and mayo, which is not as easy as it sounds.", "Then came a delicate and artfully butterflied sea bream (\u20ac18), with the bones removed but the fillets still in contact with the back. As sides, we had a very good waffle with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, trout caviar and chopped dill, parsley, and sorrel (\u20ac7) and fermented fries (\u20ac5). The fermentation gave the fries a slight acidity like British chips and vinegar.", "The dragon mayonnaise that came with them was not too shabby, and the server also gave us a dish of excellent hollandaise because it went really well with the potato.", "Near perfect", "Today\u2019s dessert was a near-perfect lemon-curd tart, with a crisp cr\u00e8me-br\u00fbl\u00e9e-style layer of burnt caramel, an outstanding variation on a class", "ic dish. My only quibble of the evening was its base, cold and damp as though thawed before the curd was added.", "Sjefietshe is not cheap like an eetcaf\u00e9. We came out nearly \u20ac160 lighter but, like I said, we ordered more than a normal guest would. In this lovely, cosy caf\u00e9, the two of you can dine on manna from heaven for around a hundred euro."], "authors": ["Gilles Van Der Loo", "Translation", "Het Vertaalcollectief"], "keywords": ["came", "gave", "version", "brown", "caf\u00e9", "really", "fries", "eetcaf\u00e9", "superlative", "sjefietshe", "good", "classic", "acidity"], "pubDate": "2019-11-07T15:04:38Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
