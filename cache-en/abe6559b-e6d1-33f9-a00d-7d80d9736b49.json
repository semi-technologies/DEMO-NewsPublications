The Times suggested that this \u201cmay be the biggest acquisition ever of the music publishing rights of a single song-writer.\u201d Universal will now collect all the income generated whenever one of Dylan\u2019s songs is sold, broadcast, streamed, covered, or placed in a film, television show, or commercial; the company will also control Dylan\u2019s copyright, meaning that it determines when and how his songs can be used, and at what price. Dylan did not offer a comment on the announcement. Jody Gerson, the chief executive of Universal\u2019s publishing arm, described the acquisition as \u201ca privilege and a responsibility.\u201d", "Few American songwriters have been as zealously exalted as Dylan\u2014and few are as consistently inscrutable. His most devoted fans spent the day speculating about Dylan\u2019s motivation: it certainly looked financial (the pandemic has grounded his Never-Ending Tour), but could also be pragmatic (he is seventy-nine, and might be taking proactive steps to organize and secure his estate). There was anxiety, of course, about how Dylan\u2019s songs could now be deployed to embarrassing or brazenly mercenary ends. But Dylan himself has not always approached his catalogue with the same seething reverence as his fans do, nor has he been especially reluctant to monetize his image.", "In 2014, \u201cI Want You\u201d\u2014a wordy, cryptic song about unwelcome love, from \u201cBlonde on Blonde\u201d\u2014was used in a Super Bowl ad for Chobani, in which a marauding grizzly bear destroys a general store in search of a cup of honey-flavored yogurt. In 2015, in a commercial for I.B.M., Dylan had a brief conversation with the company\u2019s signature artificial intelligence, Watson, about the recurring themes of his lyrics, which Watson identified as \u201cthat time passes and love fades.\u201d Dylan agreed with the assessment: \u201cThat sounds about right.\u201d My favorite example came in 2004, when Dylan, sporting his late-career pencil mustache, appeared in a moody, ponderous commercial for Victoria\u2019s Secret, co-starring the model Adriana Lima, who was wearing only her underwear and a pair of enormous wings. Dylan doesn\u2019t speak in the spot\u2014\u201cLove Sick,\u201d which opens \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d plays\u2014but glowers purposefully at the camera for a few seconds, as if to say, \u201cCan you believe this shit?\u201d (Beyond his work in commercials, Dylan has also developed his own line of whiskey, and recently revived his SiriusXM radio show, the \u201cTheme Time Radio Hour,\u201d to promote it. In 2016, he granted Amazon and Lions Gate Entertainment permission to develop any of the characters or stories in his collected lyrics into a television series.)", "2020 in Review New Yorker writers reflect on the year\u2019s highs and lows.", "Dylan\u2019s fans are multigenerational enough that reactions to the news of the sale revealed the shift in how we think about the intersection of art and commerce. I\u2019m just old enough to remember the offense and outrage unleashed by the public when a beloved song was used to sell, say, running shoes. I\u2019ve since made peace with the idea\u2014placing a track in a commercial is a relatively easy way for artists to make money in a marketplace that continues to devalue creative work\u2014but some small, eternally righteous part of me still bristles whenever I hear a song that means something repurposed as an advertising jingle. Pop songs are so useful in commercials, in part, because they allow a corporation to exploit whatever complex, visceral connection that viewers and listeners have already established with an artist. It\u2019s not fair, perhaps, to expect the artist to honor or protect that point of communion in an era in which huge numbers of fans listen for free.", "These days, how much a songwriter cares about maintaining control of her rights varies, although age does seem to have something to do with the fervency with which an artist approaches the issue. This year alone, a handful of legacy acts (including Stevie Nicks, Blondie, Barry Manilow, and Chrissie Hynde) have made similar deals, relinquishing control of their catalogues in exchange for sizable payouts. The popularity of streaming has, at least temporarily, buoyed the bigger names in the music industry, which means that new investors are now looking to scoop up evergreen music rights. (For Dylan, this all but insures that his music will remain available and highlighted on streaming services in perpetuity.)", "Meanwhile, Taylor Swift, who turns thirty-one this Sunday, has been entangled in an increasingly public and acrimonious fight with her former label, Big Machine Records, and the music manager Scooter Braun, who acquired Big Machine from its founder, Scott Borchetta, and, with it, the rights to the master recordings of Swift\u2019s first six studio albums. Swift described Braun\u2019s involvement in her career as her \u201cworst case scenario,\u201d and has accused Braun, who manages Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, of \u201cincessant, manipulative bullying.\u201d Many fans believe that at least two songs (\u201cmy tears ricochet\u201d and \u201cmad woman\u201d) on Swift\u2019s newest album, \u201cfolklore\u201d refer directly to what Swift understands as an unforgivable betrayal. \u201cI\u2019m taking\u2019 my time / Taking my time / \u2018Cause you took everything from me,\u201d she sings, her voice tender but menacing.", "For Swift, the issue seems to be less an ideological opposition to the fact that her songs might be used to sell stuff (she has had elaborate promotional partnerships with U.P.S., Target, Subway, Capital One, Diet Coke, and more), but the understandable and very human desire to maintain some degree of control over her work and legacy as she moves further into her career. Swift recently posted a note to Twitter, explaining that her team had attempted to negotiate with Braun but ultimately found his conditions\u2014namely, the signing of a nondisclosure agreement that Swift\u2019s team suggested was more commonly used to \u201csilence an assault accuser\u201d\u2014unreasonable. Instead, Swift said, she is rerecording all of her old music, a process that will ultimately diminish the value of Braun\u2019s acquisition. Swift said that the work of revisiting her old albums has been \u201cexciting and creatively fulfilling.\u201d", "Dylan\u2019s situation feels different, and not simply because he consented to the sale (or because Braun only acquired the master rights to part of Swift\u2019s catalogue, and not also her publishing rights). It is difficult, perhaps, to know precisely when an artist\u2019s work transforms into common property, becoming part of the public domain in the spiritual sense, if not quite the financial one. (That Dylan\u2019s songs have reportedly been covered more than six thousand times suggests how they have been functionally untethered from their creator.) Dylan has always seemed to subscribe to the notion that songs are never quite fixed or fully claimed, even by their authors. Instead, all music can be reimagined or reshaped to suit new purposes. He has, at times, been accused of borrowing a little too freely from other writers, including just this past spring. (\u201cFalse Prophet,\u201d a song from \u201cRough and Rowdy Ways,\u201d is extremely similar to \u201cIf Lovin\u2019 Is Believing,\u201d a B-side, from 1954, by the pianist and singer Billy \u201cThe Kid\u201d Emerson.)", "Sixty years after his recording d\u00e9but, Dylan\u2019s best-known and most resonant songs (\u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind,\u201d \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019,\u201d \u201cSubterranean Homesick Blues\u201d) are now so intensely and inextricably interwoven into the American experience that the question of \u201cownership\u201d almost seems moot. \u201cThose songs are part of the cultural ether and will be with us forever,\u201d Michael Chaiken, the curator of the Bob Dylan Archive, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, told me recently. Universal may have secured certain legal and financial privileges when it comes to Dylan\u2019s catalogue. But I\u2019d venture that the songs belong to everyone who has claimed them.", "2020 in Review"], "authors": ["Amanda Petrusich", "Amanda Petrusic"], "keywords": ["bob", "dylans", "rights", "music", "really", "used", "songs", "fans", "work", "times", "buy", "swift", "dylan"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
