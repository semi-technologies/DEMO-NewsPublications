In 2020, it was what supermodels wore to travel by air. Noted germophobe Naomi Campbell was photographed in this hazmat suit, with goggles, face mask and surgical gloves, on 11 March, months before face masks were commonplace in the UK. The reaction encapsulated the angst of those doomscrolling days, ranging from celebration, for a moment\u2019s light relief, to ire, at a time when so many medics were short of PPE (\u201cThey were acting like I was stealing supplies from the hospital \u2026 I got it on Amazon,\u201d Campbell later said). Since donated to the Fashion Museum in Bath, it is certainly an outfit for the history books. Hannah Marriott", "Paapa Essiedu", "Was just thinking how wonderful Paapa Essiedu was in \"I May Destroy You\" - his eyes, his face, so beautiful and soulful. pic.twitter.com/gIOaQXPxIh \u2014 Rebecca Theodore-Vachon (@FilmFatale_NYC) October 25, 2020", "As a brown man, I have never expected to see the way I dress reflected on TV shows. Sure, bits of clothing here and there, but nothing that really mirrors my wardrobe. So it was with my mouth in an \u201cO\u201d of surprise that I took in Paapa Essiedu\u2019s wardrobe as he played Kwame in I May Destroy You. Some items were exact replicas of mine (striped short-sleeved top, caramel teddy bear jacket) and others (beanie hats, long sleeved T-shirts) that had a familiarity. But more than seeing myself reflected in Kwame\u2019s outfits was the fact that here was a character whose wardrobe felt less costume and more, along with the rest of the show, brutally honest and authentic. The soft fabrics his character wore in early episodes gave way to more mature tones, such as mustard and teal, as his character unravelled and finally matured. Priya Elan", "Jay-Z", "Around the time of his \u201cI\u2019m sorry I cheated on Beyonc\u00e9\u201d album 4:44, Jay-Z\u2019s style did a 360-degree pivot. He effortlessly changed to suiting and bright colours. His switch from streetwear symbol to older gentleman embraced the riskier end of the style spectrum. In Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Black Is King film, he wore polo necks, draped Dior suits, polo necks and statement necklaces with no hint of midlife crisis. This was a rapper growing up in public with a dapper sense of maturity rarely seen before. My favourite bit of this evolution was his hair. He grew out dreadlocks and the result was one of the best hair makeovers of the last few years: relaxed locks with a slight nod to his hero, Jean-Michel Basquiat. It was symbolic of the ease he felt in this new style, which he totally owned. PE", "Nigella Lawson", "Nigella Lawson on Cook, Eat, Repeat. Photograph: Jay Brookes/BBC", "Along with Strictly Come Dancing, the return of Nigella to our TV screens brought a much-needed dose of glamour into our homes, during what has been a long, dark and extraordinarily tedious autumn. Just like Strictly, Nigella is two-parts wholesome radiance to one-part wink-to-camera mischief. Chez Nigella is a temple of books and fairy lights, and she dishes out her generously salted nuggets of wisdom in shiny copper measuring spoons, while wearing fitted sweaters worthy of 1950s pin-ups and talking about Proust. What would we do without her? Jess Cartner-Morley", "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez", "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cooks while lecturing her viewers about politics.

Instead, it was AOC\u2019s snappy, possibly-but-probably-not electioneering campaign merch \u2013 and in particular her \u201cTax the rich\u201d sweatshirt, made by unionised workers in the US that did it for me. In a year in which everyone from Nick Cave to Yuval Noah Harari brought out merch, and the wealthy escaped lockdown by decamping to their second homes, this slogan said it all, for a pretty reasonable $58 (\u00a342).

Forget Dominic Cummings and his misbuttoned rose garden linens, this year\u2019s poster boy was Robert Pattinson in his self-styled, self-photographed shoot for GQ magazine. It was not the clothes that did it for me \u2013 a \u201cprice on request\u201d shirt by Dior Men? In 2020? \u2013 but the mood. Here was the summer issue of a men\u2019s fashion magazine and what did we have but the hottest star in Hollywood, cooped up (like us) in a rented flat with no garden (like us), long overdue a haircut (like us), eating cornflakes and cheese. OK, the last bit wasn\u2019t quite us, but the poor guy had only a microwave to hand. MF", "Brad Pitt", "Screengrab showing Brad Pitt during a read-through of Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Photograph: Twitter", "You might think the inclusion of a suntanned Brad Pitt in an old green T-shirt is a dubious objectification of his evergreen Californian looks, but you would be wrong. Time and again, Pitt has proved himself a valuable player on team 2020 by his ability to make the feral-adjacent scruffiness that has defined this year look \u2026 quite hot. See here: not having had a haircut since lockdown. And if you haven\u2019t yet done a deep dive on Pitt volunteering in Los Angeles, in a mask and an old checked shirt, then I direct you here immediately.

Photograph: Des Willie/AP", "People-watching was not exactly a thing this year, but TV-watching was, and many took style inspiration where they could find it. Thanks to The Crown, the obsession with Princess Diana\u2019s wardrobe has reached such a fever pitch that I would say we should get out more, if only it were that simple. It\u2019s depiction of Princess Anne, however, was the real standout, layering checked shirts under olive-coloured knits, a look that spoke of no-nonsense cold-weather walks, which was handy.

Photograph: JM Enternational/REX/Shutterstock", "Harry Styles\u2019s evolution from a Simon Cowell-farmed boyband cash cow of pop to generation Z\u2019s premier gender iconoclast is perhaps the most pleasing twist of 21st-century pop culture to date. This year, he has changed the rules of dressing up for men: why be hemmed in to the tired old tropes of the tuxedo (for suave) or leather jacket (for rebels) when you can be both, in a pearl necklace and a pretty lace blouse, as seen on Styles at the Brits? Or in a Gucci chiffon gown, on the cover of Vogue? Last month, the V&A museum announced that it had acquired for its permanent collection the JW Anderson patchwork cardigan that Styles made a TikTok sensation. Harry 1 Toxic Masculinity 0.
