Then, she described a scene of sadness at the hospital, where she and her husband mourned the loss together.", "She then went on to highlight the culture of silence surrounding miscarriage: \u201cIn the pain of our loss, my husband and I discovered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suffered from miscarriage. Yet despite the staggering commonality of this pain, the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning.\u201d", "Her piece ends with the duchess urging all of us to ask each other if we\u2019re okay. It\u2019s a nod to her famous 2019 interview with ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby, where the journalist posed to her that same simple question.

In a world riddled with partisan strife, a pandemic that\u2019s left more than 250,000 dead in the U.S., and civil rights crises, she argues, there\u2019s a good chance loved ones need to be asked how they\u2019re doing\u2014just like Meghan and Harry.", "The duchess isn\u2019t the only high-profile figure to address the stigma of miscarriage; earlier this fall, Chrissy Teigen wrote a powerful personal essay about losing her third child, Jack. She revealed that at 20 weeks, she was diagnosed with a partial placenta abruption. After a few days in the hospital, the doctors told her \u201cit was time to say goodbye.\u201d", "\u201cI cried a little at first, then went into full-blown convulsions of snot and tears, my breath not able to catch up with my own incredibly deep sadness,\u201d Teigen wrote.", "As many as 15% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage\u2014which means that odds are most Americans know someone who has had one. Yet, as both women describe, it\u2019s a topic mourned, often detrimentally so, behind closed doors. The conversations started around Meghan and Teigen\u2019s stories will hopefully bring more mourning into the light.
