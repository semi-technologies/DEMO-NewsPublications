The 500,000 inhabitants of Mekelle, the capital of Ethiopia\u2019s northern region of Tigray, were spared a large-scale bloodbath. On November 28th Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, declared victory over Tigray\u2019s ruling party, the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front ( TPLF ). A military operation that had started a few weeks earlier was complete, he said. Shelling of the city began at about ten that morning. By the evening Tigray\u2019s president, Debretsion Gebremichael, and other leaders had vanished into the mountains. Crowds in the national capital, Addis Ababa, broke into celebration.", "But the fighting has not stopped. \u201cAlmost all the Tigrayan forces are outside the big towns and cities,\u201d says a TPLF intelligence officer, explaining that they had withdrawn when Ethiopian forces started shelling towns. Only hours after Abiy\u2019s announcement of victory, rockets were fired for the third time from Tigray into Eritrea, a country to its north that has been helping Ethiopian forces. There have since been reports of sporadic clashes and air raids, as well as looting in towns, including Mekelle. \u201cWe have a plan to retake our towns from the invaders,\u201d Debretsion told The Economist by text message.", "The fog of Ethiopia\u2019s month-long civil war has thickened since it was declared over. Speaking to parliament on November 30th, Abiy claimed that not a single civilian life had been lost during the march into Tigray. The UN and the more than 40,000 refugees who have fled to Sudan reckon otherwise. Hospitals in the regional capital are flooded with injured people. Medical supplies for the wounded and body bags for the dead are running low. But a communications blackout imposed on the region since the start of the conflict means it is impossible to know the true figure. Counter-claims that TPLF forces downed a jet and recaptured the town of Axum are also unverified."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["tigrayan", "tplf", "ethiopias", "capital", "war", "battle", "towns", "confusion", "abiy", "tigrays", "ethiopia", "won", "tigray", "started", "victory", "ahmed", "forces", "defeat"], "pubDate": "2020-12-01T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
