What\u2019s less discussed is that many of those people also have the technology, philosophy, and knowledge that could have prevented the rising temperatures, the uncontrollable wildfires, and the dying coral reefs in the first place.", "They\u2019re people like the Chagga in Tanzania, whose forest agriculture systems support Mount Kilimanjaro\u2019s rich biodiversity and feed a rapidly-growing population. Or the Kayap\u00f3 in the Amazon Basin, who use fire to cultivate their crops, replenish the soil, and protect their land from deforestation. In Iran, Persians have developed qanats, or underground aqueducts, which serve as natural foils to our energy-intensive pumps and wells. Then there\u2019s the Khasi people of Meghalaya, India\u2014known as the wettest place on earth\u2014who have a solution for navigating heavy rains and monsoons: They\u2019ve trained rubber fig trees to grow across rivers. Over the course of decades, the massive roots grow, tangle, and strengthen into the only bridges\u2014natural or otherwise\u2014that can withstand surging water levels and powerful storms.", "These are people who were embracing regenerative agriculture, zero-waste living, and nature-based solutions long before they were 2020 buzzwords. Architect, landscape designer, and Harvard and Columbia professor Julia Watson traveled across 18 countries for six years to visit these communities and document their ways of life in her new book, Lo-TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism, published by Taschen earlier this year. Beyond shining a light on their cultures and innovations, Watson illustrates how indigenous methods actually benefit the planet\u2014and how they might be adopted worldwide in the face of climate crisis."], "authors": ["Emily Farra", "Emily Farr", "Yessenia Funes", "Richard Williams", "Tara Houska", "Emma Specter", "Ella Riley-Adams"], "keywords": ["withstand", "worldwide", "watson", "agriculture", "earth", "whats", "wettest", "change", "grow", "climate", "way", "indigenous", "wildfires", "zerowaste", "live", "architecture"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
