The streetwear brand, founded in 2016 out of Seoul, offers zingy, manga- and anime-centric pieces that would work equally as well in a club as on the couch. Graphic prints are applied onto everything, from puffer coats to sweaters and trousers\u2014and the eccentric collection is swiftly becoming a musician favorite too. Billie Eilish, Rosal\u00eda, BTS, and many other stylish stars have recently worn the brand.", "The label began when cofounders Koh V and MLMA first met in Seoul a few years back. At the time, MLMA\u2014who is an artist and a singer-rapper\u2014was focused on her art, and Koh randomly stumbled upon some of her painted canvases. \u201cPainting was my first talent that I discovered when I was like, two or three,\u201d MLMA says. \u201cKoh was the first person who ever discovered [my work].\u201d After meeting each other, they then came up with a spontaneous idea: to apply her artwork onto clothing. Shortly after, Skoot was born.", "Now, Koh and MLMA also work with the artist problem6oy, and the trio produce bold ready-to-wear pieces that embrace wild, manga-inspired prints. \u201cAnime and manga are two huge inspirations,\u201d says Koh, while MLMA adds, \u201cI grew up around animation culture because I\u2019m from Korea. Reading comic books was really big, and those kinds of images really inspire me. I like to twist those images in my own way.\u201d Recently, the label debuted puffer coats that take imagery from \u201cAngel Attack,\u201d an episode from the Japanese anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Other references are more abstract, such as a printed turtleneck and skirt, which both come in a strong print that is inspired by \u201ca heroine who isn\u2019t afraid to cry.\u201d", "The collection is a mix of both custom, one-off pieces and ready-made items. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make everything one-of-one, but we still make a lot of custom, handmade stuff,\u201d says MLMA. The offering is also largely genderless, something that is reflected in the brand\u2019s logo (which is sometimes used to look like a bootleg designer monogram, as seen here). \u201cThe meaning of the logo means no gender: It\u2019s the male and female sex symbol combined,\u201d says Koh, while MLMA adds, \u201cClothing shouldn\u2019t have any limits in terms of gender.\u201d", "Eilish has been a supporter of Skoot from the get-go, and her personal style\u2014heavy on the graffiti prints and streetwear\u2014is a natural fit. \u201cI started following Billie really early on,\u201d says MLMA. \u201cThen, she followed me back and started wearing our stuff. One of the first pieces she wore was a fire-print hoodie that I made.\u201d Recently, Eilish wore a printed cardigan and shorts by Skoot in her \u201cTherefore I Am\u201d music video as well as for her performance at the American Music Awards. \u201cWe did those masks two days before the performance,\u201d says Koh. \u201cWe dyed them, painted them, and shipped them out the next day.\u201d In addition to Eilish, they\u2019ve also outfitted Rico Nasty, BTS, Rosal\u00eda, Blackpink, Grimes, and rapper Jackson Wang, among many other artists. They even styled a doll of BTS\u2019s Jungkook in Skoot clothes (the real Jungkook is also a big fan of Skoot).", "As a musician herself, MLMA says she can see the draw of Skoot\u2019s more theatrical pieces as a performer. \u201cWhen I wear our stuff, I always get complimented,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you wear it, you can see other people instantly reacting to it.\u201d It\u2019s a vibe Koh says is at the essence of Skoot. \u201cWe get so many emails from people saying, \u2018I wish I had the courage to wear some of your stuff,\u2019\u201d says Koh. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of it\u2014to show that you can dress [in a] ridiculous and loud and boisterous [way].\u201d"], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["billie", "work", "wear", "pieces", "really", "skoot", "artists", "stuff", "prints", "animeinspired", "brand", "stylish", "streetwear", "love", "mlma", "eilish", "recently", "koh"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
