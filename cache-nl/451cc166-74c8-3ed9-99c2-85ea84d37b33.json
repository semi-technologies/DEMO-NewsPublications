Beeld Marie Wanders", "A computer scientist by training and a big-data manager by trade, Sara Ramezani comes across as straightforward. Although the 37-year-old Iranian used to be puzzled when her Dutch colleagues would remark exactly how straightforward she is, after working in the Netherlands for over a decade, Ramezani has found that the famously frank Dutch are direct, but not about everything.", "\u201cI get this comment a lot, saying: \u2018Oh you\u2019re very direct.\u2019 But I thought you people are direct,\u201d she laughs. \u201cDutch people are \u2018oh-wow-that\u2019s-a-lot-of-food-are-you-gonna-be-able-to-eat it-all?\u2019 kind of direct, but I don\u2019t see \u2018You-didn\u2019t-do-this-work-well-you-have-to-fix-it kind of direct. Instead, I see a lot of \u2018What do you think about the quality of the work? Maybe it could have been better. Do you think it could have been? I actually see a lot of beating around the bush when it comes to work issues.\u201d", "Much of Ramezani\u2019s sector is known for, in a word, hardness.", "\u201cAs a researcher you really focus on the hard skills, especially if you\u2019re in the harder sciences,\u201d she says, citing common concerns, such as \u201coh I have to fix this algorithm, or I have to be really smart.\u201d\u2019", "The names alone of her previous employers have gravitas: the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), the Dutch research institute for mathematics and computer science (perhaps most globally known for being the birthplace of programming language Python); the Amsterdam Medical Center (AMC); and Decisive Facts, a boutique data analysis firm where Ramezani was tasked with, simply put, improving IT processes.", "And yet, \u201cI always sold myself as a \u2018geek with social skills\u2019,\u201d states Ramezani. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got the technical consultant job in the first place, because the consultants are the customer-facing technical people in the company.\u201d", "She refers to her current position at SURFsara, a company that handles research data management and offers services in high-performance computing (HPC). Ramezani started there in 2017 and, after a year, also became a group leader, managing a team of fellow technical consultants and system experts.", "\u201cBecause of this management role, I am realizing how the soft skills are so important. And actually, maybe I\u2019m better at that than I was as a programmer,\u201d she says.", "At SURFsara, where she finds \u201cthe core values are good,\u201d Ramezani identifies herself as the only non-Dutch native in management and one of just a handful of women managers. Staff total about 150.", "She likes how the new management position involves her in hiring decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see how diversity affects the hiring process,\u201d she says, describing recent interviews during which she felt her personal input, from the other side of the table, helped mitigate possible biases towards job candidates.", "\u201cHaving a seat in the room is important,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cIt\u2019s completely clear that you can really have an effect. And well, people trust me now because we worked together for a couple years.\u201d", "Plus, \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna hire a jerk if you\u2019re not a jerk.\u201d", "But a feeling of belonging is not something Ramezani takes for granted.", "\u201cIf I go to a conference, nobody ever talks to me until I start talking to them during the coffee break. It can be lonely. People aren\u2019t sure how to approach you because you look different,\u201d she admits. \u201cBecause of the headscarf a lot of times, they\u2019re like: should I talk? Should I shake hands?\u201d", "That isolation contrasts with how she remembers a pivotal seven years of childhood spent in the US. In Cleveland, Ohio, where her father got his PhD, she went to Islamic school and mosque with black Muslims.", "\u201cWe were like one of them,\u201d she remembers feeling among the welcoming community, even though \u201cwe were the only non-black people there.\u201d", "She adds: \u201cIt really set my mindset about social justice and race.\u201d", "Her father, long back in Tehran, where he is a professor and a business owner, was the first in his family to attend university, she reports. These circumstances led to her coming from \u201ca very privileged position in Iran.\u201d She moved to Amsterdam in 2007 as a graduate student with her husband, with whom she was \u201ccollege sweethearts\u201d and who, like her, did a Master\u2019s in logic at the University of Amsterdam.", "\u201cExcept for a brief stint at the student housing containers in Diemen Zuid,\u201d notes Ramezani, the couple has lived in Oost for almost all their time abroad. Today, they have two children, with whom they \u201cgo back and forth to Iran as much as possible so they feel part of that heritage,\u201d she says. But they have no current resettlement plans.", "\u201cIran is a country that is very much in transition right now and it\u2019s also a lot of pressure, both from outside and internally\u2014the government, socially. So it is more stable and less stressful to raise a family here,\u201d she says.", "Though straightforward and serious, Ramezani, once warmed up, can also be bubbly. Her humor straddles sophisticated geekiness with a joke\u2019s-on-you tendency towards self-deprecation. She jokes with as much heart as discussing \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d and \u201cwhat a really big burden\u201d it is to sensitize others to her cultural or religious differences.", "\u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable and assertive, so most of the time I\u2019m OK,\u201d she says. \u201cI go right up to the CEOs of companies because I know how to talk with them. It\u2019s pretty easy for me. It\u2019s not harder than talking to my dad.\u201d", "Ramezani\u2019s soft skills have no doubt helped her own self-understanding and navigating through everyday struggles.", "\u201cI wear my headscarf in this way,\u201d she explains, pointing to a maroon cottony fabric that is loosely draped, revealing a wavy brown hairline, \u201cbecause while I do want to identify as Muslim, I don\u2019t conform to strict rules about how a Muslim woman should or should not dress and behave.\u201d", "As for outward displays that may set her apart from the majority, \u201cI\u2019m usually open to talking about it,\u201d she says.", "Her experience, however, has been that at work \u201cmost people don\u2019t really ask,\u201d she shares. \u201cExcept for random grandpa colleagues\u2014they\u2019re not grandpas, really, just a bit older. But they have a grandpa-like way of saying: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s Ramadan you\u2019re fasting? Or why are you eating?\u2019\u201d", "Although Ramezani never feels the need to justify why she is fasting or not, when she recently witnessed such questioning making another colleague uncomfortable, she stepped in. \u201cI explained that there could be various reasons, like some people don\u2019t observe, or we\u2019re on our period.\u201d", "Her message could not have been more direct. As she puts it, \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Dude, stop asking such personal questions.
