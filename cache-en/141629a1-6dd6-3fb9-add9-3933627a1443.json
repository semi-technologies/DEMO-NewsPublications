The band played the Danceteria. My friend Edwige and I went along. I hadn\u2019t met Sade before but I knew their music. It was great \u2013 so different, so smooth. I grew up with Roxy Music. Sade felt like a 1980s version of that. Afterwards, the plan was for them to come to a party at my loft. My friend Michelle was going out with a bandmember and Edwige knew them too. She had a huge crush on Sade. I have a shot of the two of them, another of Sade looking directly at me, and this one.", "Sade was a quiet presence, but such a beauty, and so stylish: imposing, statuesque, with glowing skin, big eyes, red lipstick \u2013 a goddess. She had her hair pulled back in a braided bun and was wearing a big skirt with this quite masculine shirt. She just stood there, watching the room. Maybe she felt like she was missing out on the action. Or maybe there was somebody of interest she was looking at.", "I don\u2019t remember what we spoke about \u2013 it was 1983, babe, that\u2019s over 30 years ago! But I do remember her English accent, and that she was sweet and gracious. I mean, she could have said no to having her picture taken. The earrings she has on are ones I\u2019d given her to wear. People always thought I was a stylist \u2013 which I wasn\u2019t. I was stylish. If you look at the major fashion magazines at the time, they were horrible. Even the big labels such as Gucci seemed to be only making clothes for rich, old ladies. I stood out. My look was unique, original and sexy with la French touch \u2013 lots of bright red and sheer black, with big jewellery.", "The painting behind Sade was of a UFO, but don\u2019t ask me who it\u2019s by. I had a lot of art back then, although not as much as I do now. I would ask every artist who came over to draw in this book I had. And that\u2019s how I ended up having a beautiful Basquiat, a very rare, early drawing featuring a baseball, a crown and letters. I was advised to frame that drawing to protect it, but I still have the book, with other entries by Lounge Lizard, John Lurie and Pater Sato, that amazing Japanese designer who died of an Aids-related illness.", "We'd often have parties like this one, sometimes on the roof. Andy Warhol brought Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes once", "We\u2019d often have parties like this one, sometimes on the roof. Andy Warhol brought Duran Duran\u2019s Nick Rhodes once. Now, whenever Nick comes to New York, he sends me an email \u2013 he likes having people from the 80s come to his concerts. At the time, no one really had stylists or PR people. There were no influencers, no mobile phones, no emails: the connection with others was completely human.", "I was 20 when I came to New York. Back in France I had met a Swiss photographer called Edo Bertoglio. He gave me my first Polaroid camera. We were both in relationships, but we eloped to New York. At first, life in the city was very difficult. The language, the unbelievable winter storms, finding work \u2026 My Polaroid camera became something for me to hide behind, and maybe a tool for figuring out where I was. Mostly, it was pure voyeuristic curiosity.", "I think I was looking for beauty. I was as obsessive as people are with iPhones these days. I\u2019d take selfies. But I never really thought my pictures would become iconic. I never took them for that reason. It was more of a compulsion. And then I put them all in shoeboxes for safekeeping.", "The only person who ever said no to a Polaroid was David Bowie. I was standing by the bar in Studio 54, camera in my hand. He came right up to me to get a drink, and I asked him. \u201cNo, no, darling,\u201d he said, really sweetly. I should not have asked. I should have just snapped him.", "Maripol\u2019s CV", "Photograph: Remy Holwick", "Born: Rabat, Morocco.", "Trained: \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts, Nantes, France.", "Influences: \u201cI loved old photography, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Helmut Newton, Robert Capa, Diane Arbus.\u201d", "High point: \u201cBeing discovered by fashion houses later in life.\u201d", "Low point: \u201cLiving through numerous recessions in New York.
