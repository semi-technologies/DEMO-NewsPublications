Vacant retail shops in Columbus, Ohio. The rate of jobless claims has been rising as coronavirus cases remain high across the country. Credit... Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times Rising Covid-19 cases are taking a steep toll on economic activity, battering the labor market even as new vaccines offer a ray of hope for next year. The number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment insurance remained high last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. After dropping earlier in the fall, claims have moved higher, and they remain at levels that dwarf the pace of past recessions. There were 935,000 new claims for state benefits, compared with 956,000 the previous week, while 455,000 filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federally funded program for part-time workers, the self-employed and others ordinarily ineligible for jobless benefits. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of new state claims was 885,000, an increase of 23,000 from the previous week. Consumer caution, coupled with new restrictions on business activity like indoor dining, has pummeled the hospitality industry, lodging, airlines and other service businesses. The debut of a coronavirus vaccine this week offers the prospect of relief, but until mass inoculations begin next year, the economy will remain under pressure. \u201cBusinesses are closing, and as a result, we are seeing job losses mount \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what we were fearful of going into the winter,\u201d said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenging few months, no doubt.\u201d At the end of November, more than 20 million workers were collecting unemployment benefits under state or federal programs, Labor Department data indicates. With the weakening economy as the backdrop, Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress continued talks on Wednesday on another pandemic relief bill, something that economists have warned is overdue. Without action, two key programs for unemployed workers will expire this month, cutting off benefits to millions. \u201cWe are not moving in the right direction,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cWith the looming expiration of benefits, it\u2019s even more worrisome.\u201d Data released on Wednesday showed a 1.1 percent drop in retail sales in November, a disappointing start to the crucial holiday season. Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services, expects economic growth to be weak for the next few months before picking up later in 2021. \u201cUntil we get a lot of people vaccinated, the economy will face a difficult test,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will see an outright contraction or the loss of jobs, but the pace of improvement will slow markedly.\u201d", "Robinhood pays $65 million to settle charges of misleading customers about payments. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday said that Robinhood, the stock trading app, had agreed to pay $65 million to settle charges that it misled its customers about payments it received for handling their trades, the latest enforcement action against the popular platform. Millions of investors have turned to Robinhood in recent years, lured by a sales pitch of no trading fees. The charges announced on Thursday apply to Robinhood\u2019s disclosures from 2015 to late 2018, the regulator said. The S.E.C. had charged Robinhood with \u201crepeated misstatements that failed to disclose the firm\u2019s receipt of payments from trading firms for routing customer orders to them, and with failing to satisfy its duty to seek the best reasonably available terms to execute customer orders,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cRobinhood provided misleading information to customers about the true costs of choosing to trade with the firm,\u201d Stephanie Avakian, director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division, said in a statement. \u201cBrokerage firms cannot mislead customers about order execution quality.\u201d Dan Gallagher, Robinhood\u2019s chief legal officer, said that the company was committed to helping meet its customers needs. \u201cThe settlement relates to historical practices that do not reflect Robinhood today,\u201d he said in a statement. The federal charges come a day after regulators in Massachusetts accused Robinhood with aggressively courting and manipulating inexperienced investors and then failing to protect them. In a complaint, the Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth, William F. Galvin, said that Robinhood focused on signing up young traders with perks like free shares, and then used \u201cgamification\u201d marketing techniques to persuade them to trade often. Many of these investors were allowed to trade risky options without proper screening, the filing claimed. A representative for Robinhood, responding to the Massachusetts action on Wednesday, defended the company\u2019s policies, saying in a statement that it did not make investment recommendations. \u201cWe disagree with the allegations in the complaint by the Massachusetts Securities Division and intend to defend the company vigorously,\u201d the statement said. The representative added that it had added safeguards and educational offerings to help better inform customers about options trading.

The central bank left its benchmark interest rate at 0.1 percent and did not increase its purchases of government bonds. Credit... Andrew Testa for The New York Times The Bank of England, which has been battling not only a pandemic but the threat of a disruptive exit from the European Union, made no changes to its monetary policy Thursday amid signs that both threats could be receding. The central bank left its benchmark interest rate at 0.1 percent and did not increase its purchases of government bonds. In November, at its last meeting, the bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee expanded the bond purchases, a way of holding down market interest rates, by \u00a3150 billion. The bank said Thursday it would continue to aim for total asset purchases of \u00a3895 billion, or $1.2 trillion. The bank also extended by six months a program that allows commercial banks to borrow money at or close to the benchmark interest rate, if they funnel the money to small and midsize businesses. Successful development of vaccines against the coronavirus are \u201clikely to reduce the downside risks to the economic outlook from Covid,\u201d the Monetary Policy Committee said in a statement. But the committee also said growth would be \u201ca little weaker\u201d than policymakers expected in November because of sharper lockdowns. Negotiators for Britain and the European Union continued to meet in Brussels on Thursday, and there were indications they had narrowed their differences, potentially averting a no-deal Brexit that would be bad for both economies, but especially Britain\u2019s. In one example of the potential damage, the German automaker BMW warned that it would have to significantly raise prices for cars sold in Britain if there were no deal. Nicolas Peter, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, told German media on Wednesday that BMW would also have to raise the price of British-made Minis sold in Europe because of import and export tariffs.", "Markets edge higher as U.S. stimulus talks advance.

Republicans and Democrats alike signaled that they were ready to coalesce around the main elements, though a final agreement hasn\u2019t been reached.", "The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, on Wednesday made a point of saying the central bank was in no mood to begin scaling back its efforts to bolster the economy. He said the Fed\u2019s policy decisions were intended to show that policymakers would \u201cdeliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.\u201d He said the economy would face near-term challenges, but would likely bounce back quickly once vaccines were widely available, perhaps by midyear.", "Catch up: States accuse Google of illegal monopoly, and Tyson fires workers over Covid-19 betting pool. Ten state attorneys general on Wednesday accused Google of illegally abusing its monopoly over the technology that delivers ads online. The state prosecutors said that Google overcharged publishers for the ads it showed across the web and edged out rivals who tried to challenge the company\u2019s dominance. They also said that Google had reached an agreement with Facebook to limit the social network\u2019s own efforts to compete with Google for ad dollars. Google said the suit was \u201cbaseless\u201d and that it would fight the case.", "Tyson Foods has fired seven workers accused of being involved in a betting pool over how many employees would get the coronavirus, the company said Wednesday. The son of a meatpacking worker who died in April filed a suit claiming that the manager of the Waterloo, Iowa, pork plant organized a \u201ccash buy-in, winner take all\u201d betting pool. In all, about 1,000 workers at the plant \u2014 about a third of the work force \u2014 tested positive for the virus.

Holder Jr., the former U.S. attorney general.", "The Fed left interest rates at near-zero on Wednesday and committed to buying $120 billion worth of government-backed bonds per month for the foreseeable future. The central bank formally tied those purchases to its twin goals of maximum employment and stable inflation, saying they would continue at their current pace \u201cuntil substantial further progress has been made toward the committee\u2019s maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201d", "The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, said retail workers should be prioritized for a coronavirus vaccine, citing their frontline work in stores, distribution centers, restaurants and delivery services. The request was made in a letter sent on Wednesday to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel of independent experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to distribute the vaccines.
