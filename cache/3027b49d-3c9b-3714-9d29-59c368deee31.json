In the Caribbean, the 2020 season has been one of the most active on record.", "Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, said: \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are major, naturally occurring drivers of the Earth\u2019s climate system. But all naturally occurring climate events now take place against a background of human-induced climate change which is exacerbating extreme weather and affecting the water cycle.\u201d", "While El Ni\u00f1o, the warm phase of the climatic phenomenon, can trigger drought in Australia and India, and increase cyclones in the tropical Pacific, La Ni\u00f1a can cause eastern Pacific sea temperatures to fall by up to 3-5C, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures.", "According to Taalas, however, this is now more than offset by global heating, and 2020 \u201cremains on track to be one of the warmest years on record\u201d, with 2016-20 expected to be the warmest five-year period on record.", "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a years now are warmer even than years with strong El Ni\u00f1o events of the past,\u201d said Taalas.", "This year\u2019s La Ni\u00f1a is expected to endure into the first quarter of next year and is rated by the WMO as \u201cmoderate to strong\u201d.
