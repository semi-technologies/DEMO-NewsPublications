But the commission said the offer was for a limited period and it was only willing to act to avoid the worst disruption, including the risk of \u201cpublic disorder\u201d.", "In a move that will only serve to irritate the British government in the context of the troubled talks on a future trade deal, the commission also insisted its offer depended on the UK having \u201cequivalent\u201d regulations.", "\u201cA level playing field requires that, even after the end of the transition period, the UK continues to apply sufficiently high and comparable standards,\u201d the contingency documents state.", "Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the publication of the EU\u2019s contingency plans had been expected and the plans echoed proposals from September 2019. \u201cWe\u2019ll obviously look at the details very closely. We\u2019ve already set out our own plans in the event of a free trade agreement not being reached,\u201d he said.", "He played down the risks of supply disruption in the event of no deal, saying the UK had a \u201cresilient supply chain\u201d and had made extensive preparations.", "The publication of the contingency measures, long sought by EU member states, follows agreement on a new Sunday deadline for the negotiations between the UK\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier.", "The timetable was set at a dinner in Brussels on Wednesday night between Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, where \u201cfrank\u201d and \u201clively\u201d exchanges led to little being resolved.", "On Thursday the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the talks were unlikely to be extended beyond Sunday\u2019s deadline without substantial concessions from Brussels.", "But in a hint that the government hopes discussions might continue after the weekend if progress is being made, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cBoth the prime minister and Ursula von der Leyen have agreed that a firm decision should be made about the future of talks by Sunday.\u201d He declined to say what the substance of any potential compromise might be.", "Raab said Brussels would need to back down from its demands on controlling fishing waters and laws on standards.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that, whilst there was a good conversation last night, and it was frank and it was candid, the significant points of difference remain. I don\u2019t think we can keep going on at that pace without having some progress and some flexibility,\u201d he told the BBC.", "\u201cOn the fisheries, we\u2019ve accepted that there needs to be some sort of transitional period but we must be able to control access to our own waters. We\u2019ve agreed that we\u2019d follow the EU\u2019s approach to free trade deals with countries like Canada and Korea in relation to the so-called level playing field requirements.", "\u201cWhat we\u2019re not going to be treated \u2026 is in a way that no other country would accept, and nor would the EU accept. It\u2019s about some basic respect for democratic principles.\u201d Raab accused the bloc of lacking \u201cpragmatism and flexibility\u201d.", "Stephan Mayer, a state secretary at Germany\u2019s interior ministry, told the BBC that no deal \u201cwould be the worst solution for both sides\u201d.", "The Tesco chairman, John Allan, has suggested food bills could rise by 5% as a result of the tariffs and disruption from a no-deal Brexit. But Raab told the BBC that tariffs would be a \u201cvery minor proportion\u201d of food prices.", "\u201cOf all the things that will be a challenge, I am not concerned about either supermarket cupboards running bare or the cost of food prices. Equally, there will be some bumps along the road if we don\u2019t get a free trade deal, that\u2019s the inevitable consequence of change. But we will be well braced and well prepared to deal with those, and we are going to make a success of leaving the transition period, come what may.\u201d", "The Road Haulage Association gave a guarded welcome to the proposed six-month easement for road connectivity.

We have told them not to panic until we get more details from this Ursula von der Leyen announcement, but it is a safe bet that it means we won\u2019t need them for the first six months of next year in the event of no deal.\u201d"], "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Kevin Rawlinson", "Lisa O'Carroll"], "keywords": ["trade", "weve", "von", "transport", "uk", "commission", "nodeal", "return", "makes", "field", "offer", "told", "deal", "ursula", "playing", "level", "period", "agreement", "eu"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
