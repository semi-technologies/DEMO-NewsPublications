Morningstar rates it five stars for its stellar long-term performance, but the fund recently fired MFS, the subadvisor largely responsible for that track record, and replaced it with two relatively unknown firms.", "What happened is that USAA is no longer USAA. This past July, another asset manager, Victory Capital (ticker: VCTR), acquired it and then replaced MFS with its own in-house management teams from previous acquisitions\u2014RS Investments and Trivalent Investments. \u201cBringing the managers in-house makes it more profitable for Victory,\u201d says Russel Kinnel, Morningstar\u2019s director of manager research. \u201cSo, Victory wins; the [executives] at USAA win, as Victory cut them a check; but the USAA fund holders are just hosed.\u201d The Morningstar analyst report for the fund (USIFX) describes the new managers as \u201cundistinguished,\u201d with \u201climited analytical resources,\u201d yet if you look only at the fund\u2019s star rating, which is based purely on past performance, you wouldn\u2019t know this. Meanwhile, since Victory announced the USAA acquisition in November of 2018, its share price has nearly doubled. USAA declined to comment.", "Investors should prepare for more merger-related shifts. Since 2009\u2014when passive investing really began to take off\u2014through 2018, the number of annual mergers among publicly traded asset managers doubled, to more than 50 worldwide, according to a study by consulting firm Deloitte Casey Quirk. Including smaller private firms, the M&A number hit an all-time high of 253 deals.", "\u201cSome [asset managers] are already low-cost providers and compete on low fees, while others are high-fee providers, but are specialized so they\u2019re comfortable with their fees,\u201d says Jeff Stakel, a principal at Deloitte Casey Quirk. \u201cBut there are a lot of firms in that middle ground where they\u2019re not that differentiated and fees keep lowering. M&A is a way to build scale to offset some of that fee erosion. The benefit to the client that these organizations point to is a more streamlined cost structure to be more competitive in the market and retain investment talent.\u201d", "However, as Vanguard Group founder John Bogle pointed out long ago, such deals can come with a problem: two sets of shareholders\u2014the fund\u2019s and the asset manager\u2019s. After a merger, the question is: How much of the benefits of economies of scale is passed on to fund shareholders via lower fees or better management? In the past, there was little evidence that merged asset managers shared much of their efficiency gains. In fact, Bogle would often rail against companies that would buy asset managers, but maintain or actually raise expense ratios.", "Yet today, asset managers that merge might have no choice but to pass on some of their savings if they want to survive. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve done a merger, there has been a lower expense ratio for fund shareholders afterward,\u201d says Marty Flanagan, CEO of Invesco, which acquired OppenheimerFunds this May and Guggenheim Investments\u2019 exchange-traded-fund business last year. \u201cThe industry is so competitive, and there are so many choices, that you just have to be competitive with your fees,\u201d he added.", "In 2018, the average expense ratio of actively managed equity mutual funds fell to 0.76%, down from 1.04% in 1997, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group .", "There\u2019s also evidence that the right kind of merger can benefit fund shareholders. In a 2019 study of 176 asset manager linkups from 2001 through 2013, affecting 8,524 distinct funds, three finance professors, from universities in Canada, Holland, and Italy, found that when a merger significantly increased an acquirer\u2019s assets, the funds\u2019 risk-adjusted performance\u2014results adjusted for the fund\u2019s volatility versus its benchmark\u2014improved. The gain was 1.4 to 1.8 percentage points annually, on average, over the subsequent three years. In contrast, for mergers in which a large firm bought a small boutique, there was no noticeable difference in results.", "The reason for the difference is the more efficient division of labor at large asset managers, says one of the study\u2019s authors, McGill University\u2019s David Schumacher: \u201cWhat we see very drastically after a merger is that firms reallocate their existing fund managers so that the average manager still manages the same amount of capital in total, but that capital is more concentrated in fewer asset classes or investment styles.\u201d This prevents managers from being spread too thin, strategy-wise.", "Newsletter Sign-up", "Critics such as Kinnel argue that asset manager mergers mask a lot of bad results, because the poorest performing funds are liquidated or merged out of existence. But Schumacher says that historically such changes have been modest. Invesco\u2019s Flanagan would agree. Regarding the recent Oppenheimer acquisition, he says, \u201cThere will be some fund mergers, no doubt, but they will be around the edges. If there was going to be a lot of changes, we wouldn\u2019t have done the deal.\u201d", "Flanagan stresses the importance of retaining key investment talent, even if layoffs occur in a fund group\u2019s other divisions to reduce costs. Still, given the flux in the industry, investors\u2014now more than ever before\u2014must pay attention to any changes.", "Says Flanagan: \u201cThere are just too many money managers right now,\u201d Until there aren\u2019t, keep a close eye on who\u2019s managing your fund and how they\u2019ve done in the past.", "Email: editors@barrons.com"], "summary": "This past July, another asset manager, Victory Capital (ticker: VCTR), acquired it and then replaced MFS with its own in-house management teams from previous acquisitions\u2014RS Investments and Trivalent Investments.\nIn the past, there was little evidence that merged asset managers shared much of their efficiency gains.\nIn fact, Bogle would often rail against companies that would buy asset managers, but maintain or actually raise expense ratios.\nYet today, asset managers that merge might have no choice but to pass on some of their savings if they want to survive.\nThere\u2019s also evidence that the right kind of merger can benefit fund shareholders.", "publicationId": "8e14bddf-cd2e-3f5b-8fd5-6e34ee13999e", "url": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/mergers-of-asset-managers-are-on-the-rise-what-it-means-for-investors-51570229675?mod=hp_minor_pos18"}
