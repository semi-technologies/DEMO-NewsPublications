Here are a few gift ideas for this unusual holiday season:", "A festive hat for your dad. (He\u2019s so hard to shop for!)", "You know that thing from \u201cMen in Black\u201d that you wave in front of people\u2019s faces, and it shines a bright light in their eyes and makes them forget what happened? That would be a great gift for anyone on your list this year.", "A dog leash for your dog.", "I did some research, and it seems like that \u201cMen in Black\u201d stick thing is actually called a Neuralyzer. According to Google, it\u2019s an \u201celectro-biomechanical neural-transmitting zero-synapse repositioner\u201d that has the ability to wipe minds. Science is incredible.", "It (the Neuralyzer) definitely can make you forget at least one full year, since\u2014spoiler\u2014it helped Tommy Lee Jones forget decades of his life. So, yeah, a great gift in 2020!", "This is more of a question than a gift suggestion, but is there a store where I can get one of these Neuralyzer thingies? I keep going to Best Buy since it seems logical that\u2019s where it would be. (I mean, it\u2019s called Best Buy for a reason.) But the past few times that I\u2019ve gone, Tim in aisle four has become all riled up and shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re standing too close to me!\u201d and, \u201cStay six feet away!\u201d Tim, it sounds like you need to relax (or be Neuralyzed).", "I mean, we know it exists, out there in the world, in some form. I\u2019m still talking about the Neuralyzer. It was a physical object in the movie, right? So, for sure, there\u2019s a prop closet somewhere with that stick. The question is: Is it still functional?", "I have a fan theory that the Men in Black are actually the aliens and not the humans, and the movie is titled that because they (the aliens) are forced to live in the shadows (the \u201cblack\u201d). I only ever saw the first movie in the franchise, so it\u2019s possible the writers and directors explored this theory in later films.", "Here\u2019s another question: Why did Will Smith stop agreeing to participate in the \u201cMen in Black\u201d franchise? You\u2019d think that he was so involved in it that he\u2019d see it through to the end. Did the franchise stop including him because he got to be too expensive? Or did somebody Neuralyze him and make him forget that the movies ever even happened?", "A PlayStation 5, perhaps the greatest gift of all."], "authors": ["Claire Friedman", "Claire Friedma", "Jena Friedma", "Wren Chaver"], "keywords": ["men", "neuralyzer", "black", "mean", "gift", "2020", "franchise", "tim", "forget", "movie", "list", "question", "guide"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
