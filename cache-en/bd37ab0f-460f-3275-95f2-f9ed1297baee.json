My late wife, Louise [Medus-Mansell, a thalidomide survivor and lifelong campaigner who died in 2018] and I went to New York for our first wedding anniversary. Louise was desperate to give Harry a copy of a book she\u2019d written. We\u2019d found his address in New York but hadn\u2019t been able to make contact. Just before we were about to leave, the phone goes off and it was his PA saying: \u201cHarry\u2019s really sorry that he hasn\u2019t gotten back to you, but he just stepped off a cruise. Come around at four.\u201d", "So we went to his apartment on the Upper East Side and as soon as we walked in, there were big hugs from Harry. Proper china teacups came out \u2013 he was a typical English gent \u2013 and we sat down and reminisced for an hour and a half. Louise had known Harry since she was very young: she was a focal point of the thalidomide campaign in the late 60s and early 70s and Harry went on telly with Louise\u2019s dad, David Mason, to raise awareness. When we met in New York, Louise was having a bit of a feud with her dad, because of something she\u2019d written in her book, and Harry said: \u201cNever you mind, I\u2019ve always got your back. I will never let you children down.\u201d", "He had time for everyone in the thalidomide community. Any time he walked into a room and saw a thalidomider, his face would light up and his eyes would sparkle. Some of us have no arms or legs, but he wasn\u2019t fazed by disability whatsoever. He\u2019d make a point of either shaking your hand or touching your shoulder. I know it\u2019s a cliche, but he was a superhero to us.", "He first encountered the thalidomide story was when he was editor of the Northern Echo in the 1960s and saw pictures of children affected by the drug [which was marketed as a non-addictive sedative and prescribed to pregnant mothers to treat morning sickness]. A few years later, after he became editor of the Sunday Times, one of his investigative journalists, Phillip Knightley, brought it to his attention again and Harry asked: \u201cHas nothing been done about this?\u201d The court cases against the manufacturers were in their infancy. Distillers [which produced and marketed thalidomide in the UK] were offering 40% of a settlement that was already flawed. Harry thought the offer was a pittance and that stirred him into action. He organised a moral campaign in the Sunday Times and took the company to court.", "What he did for us was one hell of an achievement. We are for ever indebted to him", "He was physically small but a giant of a man. It was like David and Goliath: if he believed in something, he went for it, no matter how daunting. He told us about a conversation he had with a lawyer at the paper during the thalidomide campaign. The lawyer said: \u201cHarry, I don\u2019t think you can publish this\u201d and Harry said: \u201cStuff it, I\u2019m going to do it anyway.\u201d The paper reported on horror stories \u2013 about how social services weren\u2019t helping the mothers, about how the kids [affected by thalidomide] were being shunned \u2013 and forced changes to happen.", "He really stuck his neck out. Harry and David [Mason] took on Distillers along with five other sets of parents. They organised a boycott of Distillers products \u2013 Johnnie Walker was probably the best known whisky in those days. David is famous for walking along the plane, following the drinks trolley, saying: \u201cDo you really want to buy that?\u201d The two of them helped to pull together the names of every single shareholder in Distillers and wrote to them saying: \u201cDo you know what your company has caused?\u201d As a result of that mass publicity, we got a much better compensation deal \u2013 \u00a332.5m, compared to the original offer of \u00a33.25m \u2013 though Harry never felt the compensation was enough.", "We met him a good few times after 2009. Whenever he was in England, Louise always managed to find out \u2013 she wasn\u2019t a stalker, but not far off. When he appeared at Cheltenham literature festival, we got in touch and we all went out for a lovely meal. We went back to New York in 2015 and again he welcomed us into his house with open arms and we got to meet the real Evans family. He was always so generous with his time.", "When Louise decided to pull together all the various documents to do with thalidomide ahead of a big 50th-anniversary commemoration in 2012, Harry put in a word with his old boss Rupert Murdoch and lo and behold a letter arrived from Murdoch saying: \u201cIf you want to come and look at our archives, please do so.\u201d Harry nudged open a lot of doors for thalidomiders and then we jumped in and put our big feet and wheels in the way.", "What he did for us was one hell of an achievement. We are for ever indebted to him. We\u2019re all individuals in the thalidomide community, but collectively we\u2019re a family \u2013 and Harry definitely became part of that family. He was a phenomenal man."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["darren", "really", "harry", "went", "mansell", "times", "harold", "saying", "louise", "thalidomide", "york", "evans", "distillers", "david", "remembered"], "pubDate": "2020-12-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
