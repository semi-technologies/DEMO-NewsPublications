This led him to conclude that people\u2019s views on Mr. Trump may be particularly difficult to measure.", "\u201cIn the end, like so many Trump-related things, there may be different rules when polling an election with him on the ballot,\u201d Dr. Borick said. \u201cI\u2019m a quantifiable type of human being; I want to see evidence. And I only have two elections with Donald Trump in them \u2014 but both seem to be behaving in ways that others don\u2019t behave.\u201d", "Analyzing pre-election polls alongside exit polls is like comparing apples to apples \u2014 if one batch is rotten, the other probably is, too. But the exit polls can still provide a few clues as to what pre-election polls might have missed.", "At the top of that list is Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among college-educated white voters, particularly men. According to the exit polls, the candidates split white college graduates evenly \u2014 after an election season in which almost every major poll of the country and of battleground states had shown Mr. Biden ahead with white degreeholders.", "And if there is a tendency for polls to underrepresent Mr. Trump\u2019s support, it does not only affect college-educated voters, as \u201cshy Trump\u201d theorists have often suggested. Some studies had posited that highly educated Trump supporters might be more likely to say they preferred his opponent because of social pressure. In many high-quality phone polls before the election, Mr. Trump\u2019s support ran in the mid-to-high 50s among white voters without degrees. But the results of the exit polls put his support with this group firmly in the mid-60s, about on par with his totals in 2016."], "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"], "keywords": ["widely", "support", "election", "polls", "white", "underestimated", "trumps", "agrees", "trump", "voters", "exit", "mr"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
