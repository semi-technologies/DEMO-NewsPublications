That is why, throughout this fall, even as Mr. Trump urged his appointees in the Justice Department to openly announce a criminal investigation into the Biden family, they did not comply. None of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees was willing to openly investigate Joe Biden or his family members, let alone issue an indictment or civil complaint.", "Imagine if the Justice Department had followed Mr. Trump\u2019s lead. Imagine if in response to the provocations of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, a U.S. attorney had charged Mr. Biden with criminal fraud. Even if Mr. Biden ultimately prevailed in court, publicly fighting such charges during an election would be a political and logistical nightmare. The unwritten constitution blocked this line of attack on the electoral process.", "Prosecutorial independence was not limited to refusing to indict Mr. Trump\u2019s political adversaries; it also extended to indicting his allies. Over the past four years, seven of Mr. Trump\u2019s close associates were indicted and six have been convicted, including his adviser Stephen Bannon, his campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his lawyer Michael Cohen. Such convictions would be unimaginable in a dictatorship.", "None of this is to suggest that William Barr, Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney general, has served as a model of nonpartisan behavior, or that the Justice Department has been scrupulously fair. What it does show is how powerful unwritten norms can be, even in a department run by a loyalist.", "The second firewall of the unwritten constitution was the U.S. military\u2019s longstanding custom against getting involved in domestic politics. It was invaluable in checking Mr. Trump\u2019s militaristic instincts.", "On June 1, as protests and counter-protests occasioned by the killing of George Floyd became violent and destructive of property, Mr. Trump appeared in the Rose Garden of the White House and denounced what he called \u201cacts of domestic terror.\u201d He said he would \u201cdeploy the United States military\u201d if necessary to \u201cdefend the life and property\u201d of U.S. citizens. In a subsequent photo op, he was flanked by Mr. Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was clad in military fatigues. Soon, active duty forces from the 82nd Airborne Division were positioned outside of Washington.", "Mr. Trump\u2019s plan had the written law on its side. Neither the Constitution nor any congressional statute would have prevented the president from directly ordering active duty military to suppress the protests. The Constitution makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces and the Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to use the military or National Guard to suppress civil disorder, providing a broad exception to the general rule barring domestic use of the military."], "authors": ["Tim Wu"], "keywords": ["republic", "trumps", "mr", "biden", "unwritten", "justice", "constitution", "really", "department", "general", "opinion", "trump", "military", "president", "saved"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
