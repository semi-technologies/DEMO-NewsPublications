With the December update, players are given a chance to craft Snowboy with the two snowballs that are randomly generated throughout the island. Players can take these snowballs and use them to craft this magical snowman. Get Snowboy and you'll unlock special Snowflake DIY recipes. Unfortunately, though, the number of Large Snowflakes accrued are limited, but there is at least one way to maximize that return.", "With each Snowboy a player crafts and interacts with comes the distribution of a Large Snowflake, which are pretty scarce. These Large Snowflakes are then used to create those seasonal goods, which is a major incentive when returning to those islands during each event.", "Animal Crossing players can look forward to one Large Snowflake a day with a 'Perfect Snowboy'.
