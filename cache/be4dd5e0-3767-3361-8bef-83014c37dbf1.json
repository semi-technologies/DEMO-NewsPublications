For Joe Certaine, it was his \u2018last rodeo\u2019", "Joe Certaine arrived in the early morning chill Tuesday at a church.", "There would be a long week of uncertainty ahead, much that hinged on his state, but Certaine didn\u2019t know that yet. For now, he and his \u201cbrigade\u201d of trained volunteers were settling in to respond to acts of voter suppression on election day.", "In the days leading up to the election, violent protests against the Philadelphia police shooting death of a Black man, Walter Wallace Jr, deployment of the national guard and repeated taunting by Donald Trump had the city on edge. The city\u2019s district attorney had fired back at the President that if his \u201cgoon squad\u201d tried to disrupt the vote, he \u201cwould have something for you\u201d.", "In that fraught atmosphere, thousands of election observers, from non-partisan groups like Common Cause and the city\u2019s election commission, would roam the streets on Tuesday to try to keep voting from going off the rails, making it probably the most observed election in city history.", "Certaine and his group would be among them, ready to roll at Greater St Matthew Baptist church, in a predominantly Black neighborhood in the northern part of the city. This would be the 73-year-old\u2019s \u201clast rodeo\u201d, as he put it, crowning a lifetime of activism in voting rights and politics.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Certaine at a training meeting with volunteers before the election. Photograph: Jeff Garris", "From a childhood in foster homes in Philadelphia, Certaine had risen to become the managing director of the city, Philadelphia\u2019s highest unelected office, its chief operating officer. He was a campaign official for the former two-term Democratic governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell. He helped get the city\u2019s first Black mayor elected, in 1983.", "Tuesday\u2019s work was not out of the norm.", "The day began with a few hitches. Without keys to the church, Certaine had to wait in the cold for the church administrator to arrive. The person getting the vans the night before had a problem with his credit card and wasn\u2019t able to have them delivered. The guy with the two-way radios hadn\u2019t come through, either.", "\u201cMurphy\u2019s law,\u201d said Certaine, as shortly before 7am the administrator unlocked the door. \u201cI\u2019m off to a really good start.\u201d", "A few volunteers trickled in, including Rylanda Wilson, 73, a retired employee at the city\u2019s housing authority. She brought some pillow cases she planned to knit into shirts for Haitian children for a relief organization if things got slow.", "A few minutes after the polls opened at 7am, Jeff Garis, who works at a public policy thinktank, showed up. Garis, 55, has worked with Certaine for two decades on numerous elections and political issues. Today, he would be Certaine\u2019s eyes online, tracking disturbances and helping direct volunteers to any reported incidents.", "\u201cDo we have wifi?,\u201d asked Garis as he settled into a small desk.", "Certaine swore. He dialed the church administrator, who had since left the building, for the wifi password. Her voice mailbox was full. \u201cOther than Murphy\u2019s law,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on at the moment.\u201d", "A call came in. It was one of Certaine\u2019s security people, reporting a middle-aged, white man in a cowboy hat talking to voters outside a polling station in a Black neighborhood.", "\u201cI can step in and put out a fire where you need me,\u201d the voice on the line said.", "\u201cJust find out who he is,\u201d Certaine said into his cellphone.", "Another volunteer arrived, 44-year-old Josh Uretsky, who does data analysis for the Audubon Society. He said he told his wife that morning that it felt good to be taking action on something that had been stressing him out. She asked him: what if he had nothing to do today? He said he replied, \u201cWell, that would be great.\u201d", "Soon there were around 15 volunteers. The group was equally split, Black and white. They were educators, lawyers, retired city workers and entrepreneurs. They hadn\u2019t met before.", "As the morning wore on, the phones remained quiet, a sign that so far voting was going smoothly. Across the country, that would mostly be the case.", "The lull gave Certaine time to reminisce about past battles.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Certaine at the church with Kevin Harden Jr, a Philadelphia lawyer, at right. Photograph: Jeff Garris", "His first experience in voting rights activism came in the early 1960s during the civil rights movement, when he was hardly 20 years old. He was in Neshoba county, Mississippi, helping register Black Americans who had never voted before. It was not long after the murder there of three Black civil rights activists doing the same work. The 1965 Voting Rights Act, which abolished literacy tests, poll taxes and other ways of suppressing the Black vote, had not yet been passed.", "One evening, he recalled in interviews, they noticed a pickup truck following them. It forced them off the road. At gunpoint, he said, several white men made them get out of their car and walk a half-mile into the woods, in the headlights of the pickup. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything we could do,\u201d said Certaine. \u201cThey had the guns and we didn\u2019t.\u201d", "Eventually the white men fired their shotguns in the air, laughed and drove off.", "Fear has remained a primary tool of voter suppression, Certaine said, amplified by disinformation. He said even the perception of danger, fueled in part by the president\u2019s own warnings to the city, could suppress votes.", "Voter turnout in heavily Democratic Philadelphia would be critical for Democrats to overcome votes from the overwhelmingly Republican rural counties that make up much of the rest of the state. Higher than expected turnout in those red counties fueled Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory in 2016, by less than one percentage point.", "How young, Black voters lifted Biden's bid for the White House Read more", "In the days before the election this year, Certaine fielded calls and emails from concerned residents, and he tried to calm them. One passed an email to him warning about local members of the Ku Klux Klan showing up. \u201cWe must defend ourselves every damn day,\u201d the woman emailed Certaine.", "He emailed her back with the voter hotline phone number and said his team had been preparing for this for months.", "By early afternoon there still had been no calls from that hotline to Certaine\u2019s group.", "The district attorney\u2019s election taskforce by this time had reported a couple of dozen incidents around the city, involving some minor disturbances including members of the media inadvertently blocking voters from a polling station.", "\u201cI\u2019m really pleased that nothing is going on!\u201d Certaine shouted. He got on the phone with his son and kibitzed about the Eagles, Philadelphia\u2019s struggling football team.", "Outside Certaine\u2019s office, the volunteers sat in a circle, talking about everything.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Election buttons for Joe Certaine article Photograph: Jeff Garris", "They had come here braced for political confrontation on the city streets. Instead, as the day wore on, they turned their attention to other things: kids, real estate, home towns. It was a collective exhale from the political moment \u2013 even if just for a few hours.", "David Birnbaum, a 32-year-old white lawyer, discovered he had gone to the same high school as several others in the room. Some kidded him about the bow-tie he was wearing, sporting the school\u2019s colors. \u201cIt means more to me than my college or grad school,\u201d he joked back.", "Sometimes there was politics.", "\u201cOK, so I\u2019m a Republican,\u201d Paul Breda, 58, said to the group. He lives in Wharton, New Jersey and works in the educational software business. His confession silenced the room. After a moment, Josephia Rouse, a 36-year-old family attorney from Baltimore, nodded her head.", "\u201cOK, OK,\u201d she said, encouragingly.", "He explained to everyone his political views and how he didn\u2019t want all Republicans to be painted with the same brush.", "Off to one side, Wilson silently worked on the shirts she was making from pillowcases for Haitian children. She had managed to knit 30 of them. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have all this time,\u201d she said.", "It turned out all the missteps that morning didn\u2019t matter, after all. \u201cI\u2019m just proud,\u201d Certaine told the group. \u201cI\u2019m proud of us, proud of the city.\u201d"], "authors": ["Christopher Rhoads"], "keywords": ["proud", "voter", "black", "certaine", "rights", "voting", "volunteers", "election", "white", "church", "political", "philadelphia", "city", "suppression", "im", "fighting"], "pubDate": "2020-11-08T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
