I calculated I had a day to salvage them. My son doesn\u2019t eat lasagna. (It\u2019s a combination of ingredients, and he is a purist.) But a quick search yielded a recipe for ricotta gnocchi: the simplest kind of dumpling. I mixed egg yolks, ricotta, Parmesan, salt, and a smattering of flour, and was rewarded with tiny, savory pasta cushions, light as air.", "The following morning, my attention was drawn to a shelf of dusty cookbooks containing recipes involving fresh dough. As a rule, I avoid the stuff. When I mix flour with water, I end up with glue. Dried pasta is the best invention of humankind. Why mess with perfection?", "But the simplicity of my ricotta gnocchi left me with an itch. I love dumplings, in all varieties. I love potato gnocchi with Genovese pesto. I adore Northern Chinese jiaozi. (I ate eight a day for a whole year in New York in my 20s, at the Eldridge Street storefront that now houses the famed Vanessa\u2019s Dumpling House.) I love Piedmontese agnolotti, Russian pelmeni, Ukrainian pierogi, Japanese gyoza. I love har gow from China, Turkish manti, Nepali momos, kreplach from all of Eastern Europe.", "I\u2019ve always judged these too complicated to make\u2014but if my ricotta gnocchi were technically dumplings, perhaps I\u2019d been wrong?", "I boarded a train bound for New York City, dumpling capital of North America. Dumplings are part of nearly every cuisine in the world\u2014oddly, other than French, which never figured out noodles the way other cultures did\u2014and Italian and Chinese dumplings are the apex of dumpling excellence. My plan: I would study under experts whose dumplings I hoped to master. As the sunlight-spotted Hudson River rushed by, I plunged into reading and found that, according to Harold McGee\u2019s essential On Food and Cooking, some form of dough product was made in China as early as 200 B.C.E. By 300 C.E., one finds an \u201cOde to Bing\u201d\u2014bing are today a kind of Chinese flatbread\u2014that describes the making of dough from flour and water or broth and resulting in a mixture \u201csoft as silk floss in the springtime.\u201d Jiaozi are mentioned in documents from before 700 C.E. Apparently there are even dumpling fossils dating to the ninth century.", "I disembarked at Penn Station and quickly made my way to Misi in Brooklyn, Missy Robbins\u2019s newest temple to pasta. Misi is home to what I believe to be the best stuffed Italian dumpling in the city\u2014though it goes by a rather confusing term: occhi. Occhi means eyes, and Robbins traces it to an off-menu special she tasted once at a trattoria in Zibello, Italy. It is a faultless dumpling: pliant marigold-yellow dough full to bulging with sheep and cow ricottas, with nary an atom of air between. (Air bubbles both increase the chance of a rupture and occupy real estate better used by filling.) The 15 occhi per order arrive delicately dressed in creamy butter and liberally topped with grated lemon zest and bottarga\u2014the rich, salted, dried, and cured roe sack of a mullet."], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Tamar Adle", "Elise Taylor", "Alexandra Macon", "Jenna Rennert", "Michelle Ruiz", "Sophie Kemp", "Nicole Phelps"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/tasting-making-best-dumplings-nyc?mbid=social_onsite_pinterest", "keywords": ["dumplings", "best", "flour", "food", "love", "writer", "making", "gnocchi", "dough", "chinese", "occhi", "dumpling", "ricotta", "pasta", "thought", "tasting", "yorks"], "summary": "But a quick search yielded a recipe for ricotta gnocchi: the simplest kind of dumpling.\nBut the simplicity of my ricotta gnocchi left me with an itch.\nI love dumplings, in all varieties.\nI\u2019ve always judged these too complicated to make\u2014but if my ricotta gnocchi were technically dumplings, perhaps I\u2019d been wrong?\nDumplings are part of nearly every cuisine in the world\u2014oddly, other than French, which never figured out noodles the way other cultures did\u2014and Italian and Chinese dumplings are the apex of dumpling excellence.", "title": "Food for Thought: One Writer on Tasting (and Making) New York\u2019s Best Dumplings"}
