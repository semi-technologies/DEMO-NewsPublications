She\u2019s already conquered a slew of screaming arenas in Europe and will soon headline in the U.S. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Sick, let\u2019s do that,\u2019 \u201d she says, whenever an opportunity to perform presents itself. \u201cI want as many people as possible to listen to my songs.\u201d Anyone who\u2019s even passed by a club this year probably already has: Mabel, whose debut album, High Expectations, was released this summer, specializes in the sort of anthemic R&B tunes that DJs can rely on to get even the deadest of dance floors shaking. Her over-it-all single \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Up\u201d is thus far the top-selling single by a U.K. female artist of 2019.", "We are meeting in a quiet corner of Peckham Levels, a multistory car park turned Instagrammable arts venue in South London. Mabel, who shot an early music video in the building\u2019s neon-pink stairwell, has dressed with the sort of can\u2019t-be-bothered sexiness that only those at the dewy dawn of adulthood can pull off: cycle shorts, a Calvin Klein bralette, and fluffy Fendi slides. \u201cLashes, nails, and hair,\u201d she confides. \u201cThat\u2019s how you can get away with it.\u201d", "The ability to feel comfortable anywhere is something the 23-year-old learned young. Born in M\u00e1laga, Mabel had lived in London, Stockholm, and London again by the time she was 18, spending most of her teenage years in Sweden. Since releasing her debut single in 2015, Mabel has chosen to lean into this itinerant lifestyle. \u201cI wake up in hotels now, and I have no idea where I am,\u201d she says. Still, anything beats being bored in Sweden. The country venerated by lifestyle bloggers for its philosophy of lagom\u2014balance and moderation in all things\u2014was too small, slow, and obsessed with acoustic guitars for a girl who dressed like Aaliyah (the result, she says, of having two older sisters obsessed with \u201990s R&B). \u201cI felt trapped,\u201d Mabel recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t look right. I didn\u2019t sound right.\u201d She became depressed and left school in her teens to study at home. \u201cI wonder sometimes if it was extreme exhaustion from being really anxious,\u201d she says. Mabel now views the depression as situational but the anxiety as lifelong\u2014a reality she confronts on High Expectation\u2019s \u201cOK (Anxiety Anthem).\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to wake up one day and it\u2019s just going to be gone forever, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d she tells me.", "Tonight she\u2019s dedicating a rare night off to cooking vegan lasagna with friends at her flat in Notting Hill\u2014a decorous neighborhood that she chose explicitly because \u201cI\u2019m not going to run into people who I\u2019d bump into in the club.\u201d When she has a break she reads\u2014currently Isabel Allende\u2019s Maya\u2019s Notebook\u2014and plays the piano that sits pride of place in her otherwise sparsely furnished apartment. (She\u2019s converted the master bedroom into a walk-in wardrobe to house her sneaker collection.)", "Mabel knows it would be a bad idea to get too comfortable right now. With the exception of \u201cOK,\u201d High Expectations is an album almost exclusively about her exes. Mabel loves love\u2014and tells me so repeatedly. She even kind of loves heartbreak. The problem is that it\u2019s been ages since there was time for any of it. She says she\u2019s so busy that she\u2019s been single for a year and a half (then sheepishly corrects the record: It\u2019s been more like two). While she eventually hopes to find a relationship that emulates her parents\u2019 30-plus-year partnership, she\u2019s mature enough to know that what she needs right now is\u2014ironically\u2014a bit more drama in her life. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many songs that I can write about being really happy,\u201d she tells me bluntly, rapping her beige acrylics on the table with sweet, scheming intent. \u201cWho\u2019s album two?\u201d she muses. \u201cWhere do I look for you?\u201d"], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Harriet Fitch Little"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/mabel-us-tour-second-album?mbid=social_onsite_pinterest", "keywords": ["finding", "london", "tour", "im", "album", "going", "right", "tells", "single", "shes", "high", "mabel", "second", "love", "expectations"], "summary": "\u201cWhenever I knew my parents had friends coming round, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Okay, tonight I\u2019m going to do a show,\u2019 \u201d recalls the singer, whose uncle is Eagle-Eye Cherry and godfather is Michael Stipe.\nToday, of course, Mabel, who was nominated for British Breakthrough Act at this year\u2019s BRIT Awards, is used to much larger audiences.\nHer over-it-all single \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Up\u201d is thus far the top-selling single by a U.K. female artist of 2019.\nSince releasing her debut single in 2015, Mabel has chosen to lean into this itinerant lifestyle.\nWith the exception of \u201cOK,\u201d High Expectations is an album almost exclusively about her exes.", "title": "Mabel on Her U.S. Tour, Her Second Album, and Finding Time for Love"}
