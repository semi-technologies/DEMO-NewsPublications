This position is untenable. Every trade agreement presupposes a certain waiver of sovereignty, and every day Johnson insists makes it more difficult to give in\u201d.", "The only hope for a successful outcome, it concluded, was that Johnson \u201ccannot really be interested in a no deal. Because, according to his own government\u2019s forecast, this would permanently depress UK growth by two additional percentage points\u201d.", "For Die Welt, Johnson has \u201calways insisted that Britain would not have to make any painful compromises if it left the EU. He rejected an extension of the transition period. He insists Britain will thrive with a no deal. It is difficult for him now to make the concessions necessary for a deal\u201d.", "Walking away from the talks was \u201cnot an option\u201d for the Europeans, agreed the Netherlands\u2019 NRC Handelsblad, even if the EU\u2019s negotiator, Michel Barnier, was now \u201cmillimeters away from what is acceptable to member states. The EU has reached its pain threshold with regard to the concessions it can make\u201d.", "But it is Johnson who faces the more difficult decisions, the paper says. \u201cThe consequences of failure are greater. He is under too much pressure from the Brexiteers within his own group. Sovereignty is a sacred concept to them. Cede too much and they will not hesitate to withdraw their support.\u201d", "But at the same, it added, \u201cJohnson will also know that no deal will make his political life more difficult. He will have to answer for an even bigger economic downturn, after saying for years that a deal was a piece of cake. And that could increase support for independence in Scotland and fuel renewed instability in Northern Ireland.\u201d.", "France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration said Brexit had already \u201cbeaten all the popes in history\u201d, with three years elapsing between the death of Clement IV in 1268 and the arrival of Gregory X in 1271. \u201cThe Brexit logs have been in the chimney for 1,625 days, since 23 June, and there is still no sign of white smoke,\u201d the paper said.", "Lib\u00e9ration did not dare predict the outcome of the talks. \u201cThe negotiators are armed with instructions on possible compromises \u2013 on fisheries, the level playing field, dispute arbitration.

Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. 'Give us our money back' Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the \"iron lady\" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand \u201cour own money back\u201d claiming for every \u00a32 contributed we get only \u00a31 back\u201d despite being one of the \u201cthree poorer\u201d members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in \u201cembryo\u201d. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. 'No, no, no' Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was \u2018no, no, no\u2019 to what she saw as Delors\u2019 continued power grab.

Black Wednesday A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The single market On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of \u201ca single market without barriers \u2013 visible or invisible \u2013 giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most prosperous people\".
