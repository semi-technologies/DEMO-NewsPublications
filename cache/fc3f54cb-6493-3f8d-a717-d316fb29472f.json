In a barren world, each single-celled amoeba was an inconceivably rich concentration of resources, and to live was to be beset by parasites. One of these, the giant Mimivirus, masqueraded as food; within four hours of being eaten, it could turn an amoeba into a virus factory. And yet, as the nineteenth-century mathematician Augustus de Morgan said, \u201cGreat fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite \u2019em, and little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum.\u201d The Mimivirus had its own parasites, which sometimes followed it as it entered an amoeba. Once inside, they crippled the Mimivirus factory. This trick was so useful that, eventually, amoebas integrated the parasites\u2019 genes into their own genomes, creating one of the earliest weapons in the immune system.", "We tend to associate \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d with lions hunting antelope. But disease\u2014the predation of parasites upon hosts\u2014is actually the most potent force in evolution. \u201cEvery single phase of life has been selected to try to avoid parasitism,\u201d Stephen Hedrick, an immunologist at the University of California, San Diego, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s driven evolution as hard as it could be driven. Because it\u2019s life or death all the time. And it\u2019s a co-evolution.\u201d Whenever a host develops an immune defense, it perversely rewards the survival of the very parasites that can defeat it. Hosts, meanwhile, tend to be at an evolutionary disadvantage. \u201cBacterial or viral populations are truly vast in size,\u201d Robert Jack and Louis Du Pasquier write, in \u201cEvolutionary Concepts in Immunology,\u201d and the wide variation among them gives natural selection many candidate organisms upon which to work. Viruses and bacteria also reproduce half a million times faster than we do. Given this \u201cgeneration gap,\u201d Jack and Du Pasquier write, \u201cone might well ask how on earth we could possibly have survived.\u201d", "A clue comes from the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. It spends much of its life marauding alone, eating things. But, when food is scarce, it releases molecules that serve as a flocking signal to others of its kind; the amoebas merge, forming a superorganism of as many as a hundred thousand members. For this multicellular \u201cslime mold\u201d to be effective, almost all the amoebas must give up their ability to eat, lest they prey on one another. The few that retain it don\u2019t eat for themselves; rather, they swallow up debris and dispose of it to protect the organism. The other amoebas, freed from the burdens of offense and defense, form a \u201cfruiting body\u201d that releases spores for reproduction. Although none of the individuals would survive on their own, the collective thrives.", "A human being is likewise a society of cells, with a co\u00f6rdinated defense. Our circulatory system doubles as a communications network; our blood vessels have an \u201cendothelial\u201d lining\u2014a surface that is charged with the intelligent routing of immune cells. When ordinary cells are infected by a pathogen, they send signals to their neighbors, who pass them on until they reach the endothelial cells. In response, the blood vessels swell, creating off-ramps through which white blood cells, which are part of the immune system\u2019s circulating defense force, can flow toward the site of infection. This is merely the beginning of our immune response.", "Our bodies, like the United States government, make a startlingly large investment in defense. Our bone marrow produces billions of immune cells each day, and then discards most of them. Almost every one of our cells is perpetually scanning itself for evidence of invasion. The system is complex\u2014ask a microbiologist about immunology and she\u2019ll whistle, wishing you luck. Those who describe it often resort to metaphor. Contemplating the enormous amounts of information that it collects and synthesizes throughout the body, Jack and Du Pasquier suggest that \u201cthe immune system can be regarded, above all else, as a computational device.\u201d", "This device is so finely tuned that we seldom notice it at work. Our guts burble with foreign microbes outnumbering human cells roughly ten to one, but the good are seamlessly sorted from the bad; every day, some of our cells grow into cancers, but the immune system dispatches them before they become dangerous. On a recent camping trip, I was bitten three times by some kind of insect while putting my arm into a jacket sleeve. Who knows what entered my bloodstream. Almost immediately, three welts formed; a few minutes later, the welts came down. In moments like that, it is easy to assume that we hold the advantage over the parasites.", "On Friday, March 6th, a purified sample of the novel coronavirus arrived at the laboratory of a virologist named Benjamin tenOever, at the Icahn School of Medicine, in East Harlem. Many virology labs focus on a single pathogen, but tenOever\u2019s studies dozens of viruses and how they change the cells they infect. During the winter, tenOever and his team were focussed on the flu. But, as the coronavirus pandemic began to escalate in the U.S., they initiated a side project, infecting lung cells in a dish with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and studying the results. TenOever posted their preliminary analysis to Twitter on March 14th. Within a week, a program manager at the Defense Department e-mailed to ask about the research. Two weeks later, Defense gave tenOever a $6.3-million grant to find out what the new virus was doing to our immune systems.", "Born to Dutch parents, tenOever grew up in rural Ontario. Now forty-three, he approaches his work with an amused, easy confidence. On March 26th, he gathered his team and they discussed their plan. They would take half a dozen viruses\u2014including SARS, MERS, and the new coronavirus\u2014and induce infections in hosts, starting with cells in a petri dish and graduating to ferrets. They\u2019d study the results to understand what made the new coronavirus unique. Their goal was to have results in three weeks.", "The infections took place inside the lab\u2019s Biosafety Level-3 facility, a series of nested rooms in which each is kept at a lower pressure than the one surrounding it, so that air flows inward and up an exhaust chute containing sensitive filters. In the \u201cwarm zone,\u201d where there is always the danger of being exposed to a live virus, you must wear a gown, two sets of gloves, two sets of shoe covers, a respirator mask, a face shield, and a bouffant cap. You work with your arms under a hood, protected by an extra set of disposable sleeves. When you\u2019re finished with your experiment, you disinfect this gear and throw it into an autoclave\u2014a kind of kiln\u2014where it cooks for twenty minutes. To return to the \u201ccold zone,\u201d you remove your shoe covers before stepping over a red line. In New York, at the end of March, these precautions had a whiff of the absurd: in a city where around three thousand new coronavirus cases were being diagnosed each day, you were more likely to be exposed to a highly pathogenic virus in your neighborhood.", "A Ph.D. student named Daisy Hoagland, who had herself just recovered from a mild case of COVID-19, prepared the samples for analysis. Using a shaker machine and test tubes loaded with sand and ceramic pellets, she turned a suspension of ferret lung cells\u2014some from infected animals, and others from members of the control group\u2014into a homogeneous juice, then separated the solution in a centrifuge that generated fifteen thousand g\u2019s. It is painstaking work. (\u201cI listen to a lot of podcasts,\u201d Hoagland said.) Using a pipette, she carefully transferred the topmost layer, a pink liquid, into another tube, which she centrifuged again, until she had a purified sample of RNA. This she handed off to her colleagues Rasmus M\u00f8ller and Maryline Panis for sequencing. The process takes sixteen hours to complete, and M\u00f8ller, who during the height of the pandemic lived in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, often biked home at dawn over the Pulaski Bridge.", "Whereas the sequencing of DNA defined molecular biology in the early two-thousands, the sequencing of RNA defines it today. If you imagine a cell as a kind of computer, then your DNA contains all the software that it could possibly run. It is a somewhat astonishing fact of life that the exact same DNA is shared by every cell in your body, from the skin to the brain; those cells differ in appearance and function because, in each of them, a molecular gizmo \u201ctranscribes\u201d some DNA segments rather than others into molecules of single-stranded RNA. These bits of RNA are in turn used as the blueprints for proteins, the molecular machines that do most of a cell\u2019s work. If DNA is your phone\u2019s home screen, then transcription is like tapping an icon. By sampling the RNA present in a group of cells, researchers can see which programs those cells are running at that moment; by sampling it after the cells have been infected with a virus, they can see how that virus substitutes its own software.", "TenOever\u2019s team quickly discovered that SARS-CoV-2 was uncannily good at disrupting cellular programming. A typical virus replaces less than one per cent of the software in the cells it infects. With SARS-CoV-2, tenOever said, about sixty per cent of the RNA in an infected cell is of viral origin\u2014\u201cwhich is the highest I\u2019ve ever seen. Polio comes close.\u201d Among other things, the virus rewires the alarm system that cells use to warn others about infection. Normally, as part of what is known as the \u201cinnate\u201d immune response\u2014so called because it is genetically hardwired, and not tailored to a specific pathogen\u2014a cell sends out two kinds of signals. One signal, carried by molecules called interferons, travels to neighboring cells, telling them to build defenses that slow viral spread. Another signal, transmitted through molecules called cytokines, gets a message to the circulatory system\u2019s epithelial lining. The white blood cells summoned by this second signal don\u2019t just eat invaders and infected cells; they also gather up their dismembered protein parts. Elsewhere in the immune system, these fragments are used to create virus-specific antibodies, as part of a sophisticated \u201cadaptive\u201d response that can take six or seven days to develop.", "Usually, the viruses that humans care about are successful because they shut down both of these signalling programs. The coronavirus is different. \u201cIt seems to block only one of those two arms,\u201d tenOever told me. It inhibits the interferon response but does nothing about the cytokines; it evades the local defenses but allows the cells it infects to call for reinforcements. White blood cells are powerful weapons: they arrive on an inflammatory tide, destroying cells on every side, clogging up passages with the wreckage. They are meant to be used selectively, on invaders that have been contained in a small area. With the coronavirus, they are deployed too widely\u2014a carpet bombing, rather than a surgical strike. As they do their work, inflammation distends the lungs, and debris fills them like a fog.", "\u201cThou shalt not comment on the haircut.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Benjamin Schwartz", "In late May, tenOever\u2019s team shared its findings in the biweekly journal Cell. In their article, they argued that it\u2019s this imbalanced immune response that gives severe COVID-19\u2014which can sometimes cause blood clots, strange swelling in children, and ultra-inflammatory \u201ccytokine storms\u201d\u2014the character of an autoimmune disorder. As the virus spreads unchecked through the body, it drags a destructive immune reaction behind it. Individuals with COVID-19 face the same challenge as nations during the pandemic: if they can\u2019t contain small sites of infection early\u2014so that a targeted response can root them out\u2014they end up mounting interventions so large that the shock inflicts its own damage.", "The gears of the immune response that come apart in COVID-19 were discovered slowly, in a blundering way, as though science itself were recapitulating evolution. In a sense, there are several immune systems. In health, they co\u00f6rdinate with and balance each other. But a machine with so many moving parts is, inevitably, vulnerable.", "Immunology as we know it began in earnest in 1882, at the Italian seaside. Ilya Metchnikoff, a Russian zoologist who would later help popularize yogurt in Western Europe, had developed an obsession with digestion, and with the process by which one cell eats another. In his memoir, Metchnikoff described the insight that would define his career. His family had gone to the circus, but he\u2019d stayed home, \u201cobserving the life in the mobile cells of a transparent starfish larva\u201d through his microscope. Suddenly, a thought occurred to him:"], "authors": ["James Somers", "James Somer"], "keywords": ["rna", "life", "tenoever", "coronavirus", "virus", "hacks", "response", "defense", "system", "cells", "work", "immune"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
