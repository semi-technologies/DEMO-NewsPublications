But looming over the Biden team\u2019s planning is the possibility that Republicans in the Senate decide to stonewall a nominee, blocking confirmation of anyone Biden puts forward.", "Their ability to do that will rest on who wins two Senate runoff races in Georgia. If Democrats win, they wrest control of the vital upper chamber away from Republicans. But if Republicans triumph, it raises the prospect they can stonewall any Biden nominee for a specific cabinet position.", "In that scenario, one option for Democrats would be to follow Donald Trump\u2019s example and controversially install cabinet officials under the \u201cacting\u201d moniker, where they are not confirmed but serve in that role regardless.", "In the later period of his administration, Trump made a habit of appointing acting heads to federal agencies, thereby circumventing the usual confirmation process, even with Republicans controlling the Senate.", "\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s not an unhelpful precedent,\u201d a Senate Democratic aide said of the idea of Biden appointing acting cabinet secretaries in the face of a Republican blockade.", "If Democrats control the Senate, the Senate majority will almost certainly move in lockstep to confirm Biden\u2019s nominees as a demonstration of the incoming president\u2019s promise to \u201clower the temperature\u201d of American politics. If Republicans control the chamber, gumming up confirmations is a tempting way to generate leverage with a new president who has promised to work with the opposing party.", "It\u2019s unclear which of Biden\u2019s nominees Republicans will find most objectionable.", "So far, the most opposition Republicans have sounded on any of Biden\u2019s nominees has been over Neera Tanden, the president of the progressive Center for American Progress. Biden nominated Tanden to run the Office of Management and Budget. Drew Brandewie, the communications director for the Texas senator John Cornyn, one of the highest-ranking Republicans in the Senate, tweeted that Tanden has \u201czero chance\u201d of getting confirmed.", "Neera Tanden, who has an endless stream of disparaging comments about the Republican Senators\u2019 whose votes she\u2019ll need, stands zero chance of being confirmed. https://t.co/f6Ewi6OMQR \u2014 Drew Brandewie (@DBrandewie) November 30, 2020", "The Ohio senator Rob Portman, a former OMB director, told reporters he supported a hearing for Tanden but that she is \u201cproblematic as a nominee, and I would hope the Biden administration would reconsider nominating her.\u201d", "If Republicans retain control of the Senate, Portman will chair one of the committees that handles Tanden\u2019s nomination.", "Republicans are expected to aggressively fight at least a few of Biden\u2019s nominees, not just Tanden. Conservatives have already started to signal a critical interest in the dealings of the consulting firm the secretary of state nominee Tony Blinken helped co-found, WestExec Advisers.", "Biden transition team officials, congressional Democrats, and veterans of the process are hesitant to think about a worst-case scenario like a Senate blockade over multiple nominees. The Biden transition team has set a goal of meeting with every member of Congress, according to a Biden transition official. The team is also in the process of setting up meetings between nominees and senators, the official said, a sign that the incoming administration still hopes it can engineer some bipartisan support.", "\u201cOver the course of just the last eight days, President-elect Biden has put forward a group of experienced and committed nominees who will rebuild our relationships in the world and build back our economy,\u201d the Biden transition team spokesman, Sean Savett, said in a statement.", "He added: \u201cThe process of engaging with Democratic and Republican members and offices is already well under way and it will only pick up in the weeks ahead. While we fully expected disagreement with some members of the Senate, we have no doubt that the American people fully expect the consideration and confirmation of qualified nominees.\u201d", "Phil Schiliro, the former White House director for legislative affairs during the Obama administration, said he expected the confirmation period for Biden\u2019s nominees to be similar to past ones.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be aberrational,\u201d Schiliro said. \u201cIn part because we\u2019ve just had an aberrational presidency where norms have been broken repeatedly, and I think there are Republican senators who have had a real problem with that whether they can articulate it or not is one thing. But there\u2019s been a real norm where there comes to confirmations for the cabinet that\u2019d be done expeditiously and professionally and I would expect that\u2019s going to happen again.\u201d", "The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the highest-ranking Republican official in the chamber, for example, broke longtime precedent on supreme court nominees when he refrained from allowing a hearing on Barack Obama\u2019s pick of Merrick Garland. More recently, he went back on his own logic for refraining from holding hearings on Garland when Republicans quickly moved Amy Coney Barrett through the Senate\u2019s hearings.", "In other words, there\u2019s precedent for McConnell and the current crop of Republican leadership to buck longstanding Senate traditions. It\u2019s also normal for a few cabinet nominees to not make it through the confirmation process.", "Schiliro noted though that Biden has a \u201chistory of good relationships with the Senate even though the Senate has changed a lot. There\u2019s still a fair amount of members he has good relations with and there\u2019s goodwill and trust.\u201d"], "authors": ["Daniel Strauss"], "keywords": ["biden", "republican", "picks", "block", "try", "bidens", "senate", "nominees", "republicans", "mulls", "options", "case", "confirmation", "team", "cabinet", "tanden"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
