Preston\u2019s Daniel Johnson missed a penalty soon after half-time but two goals in a four-minute spell \u2013 from Scott Sinclair and Emil Riis Jakobsen \u2013 put paid to the home side\u2019s hopes. Preston added a third through Brad Potts in stoppage time to confirm their superiority.", "Preston have failed to pick up a point at home this season but this was a fourth successive win in an unbeaten five-match run on their travels. \u201cThis seems to be quite common for us on the road,\u201d their manager, Alex Neil, said. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the win but I\u2019m still a bit perplexed at how poor we\u2019ve been at home in comparison to being away.\u201d", "Watford were forced to come from behind to beat Stoke 3-2 in a thriller at Vicarage Road. Steven Fletcher had put Stoke in front after two minutes but Tom Cleverley restored parity just before the half-hour mark. A Jo\u00e3o Pedro penalty on 61 minutes put Watford in front but Nick Powell\u2019s fine goal, with nine minutes left, looked to have sealed a share of the spoils. However, in stoppage time Isma\u00efla Sarr pounced for a dramatic winner.", "\u201cWe didn\u2019t feel [Watford\u2019s first] was a goal,\u201d said the Stoke manager, Michael O\u2019Neill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the replays and it\u2019s clear the initial shot did not cross the line. The technology was triggered by the Watford player\u2019s contact with [our goalkeeper] Angus [Gunn] that puts the ball over the line. We felt the referee missed a handball in the buildup to the third goal as well.\u201d", "Sheffield Wednesday were not in action but they briefly moved off the bottom after having their points deduction reduced from 12 to six. The club were hit with the deduction in July for the 2020-21 season after an independent disciplinary commission, appointed under EFL regulations, deemed they should not have included profits from the sale of Hillsborough stadium in statements for the period ending July 2018.", "An independent league arbitration panel did not agree with Wednesday\u2019s claim that a points deduction should not have been imposed but the punishment was halved, effective immediately.", "Wycombe celebrate their late winner at Birmingham City. Photograph: James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images", "However, Wycombe\u2019s comeback win at Birmingham sent Wednesday back to the foot of the table. Gareth Ainsworth\u2019s side were trailing 1-0 to Marc Roberts\u2019 40th-minute header but Scott Kashket equalised with 14 minutes to go and they secured a deserved winner in the second minute of injury time as Fred Onyedinma\u2019s header went in off Kristian Pedersen. It takes their undefeated run to three games.", "Derby\u2019s dreadful home run continued as a late header from Macauley Bonne gave QPR a 1-0 win at Pride Park and Derby slipped to second bottom. The game looked to be heading for stalemate until the former Charlton man struck to give Rangers a first away win of the season. The home side had their chances, with the lively Wayne Rooney denied by Seny Dieng and the woodwork, but QPR also created openings.", "Luton earned a well-deserved three points with a 1-0 win at Rotherham. Luke Berry produced an inch-perfect free-kick into the box after 70 minutes and James Collins volleyed home his fifth goal of the season.", "Lyle Taylor\u2019s penalty six minutes into added time helped Nottingham Forest claim a 2-1 victory over Coventry and hand Chris Hughton his first home win as manager. Forest looked to be on course for their fourth 1-1 draw of Hughton\u2019s six-match tenure after Callum O\u2019Hare\u2019s 57th-minute header had cancelled out a first-half goal from Scott McKenna.", "Taylor won a penalty and took it to seal victory with the final kick of the game. \u201cIf you touch Lyle Taylor he will go down, inside or outside the box,\u201d said Coventry\u2019s manager, Mark Robins. \u201dYou cannot give him the opportunity to do that.\u201d"], "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "keywords": ["reading", "penalty", "deduction", "earth", "preston", "points", "season", "point", "bring", "manager", "goal", "stoke", "cut", "minutes", "header", "leaders", "scott", "win", "wednesdays"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
