The buyer purchased the PS5 from a scalper for $878. While that may sound high, it's a lot lower than a lot of the prices scalpers are asking for, which ranges well above $1,000.", "The buyer told police that he didn't expect anything to be amiss when the package arrived, he only noticed something was wrong when he opened up the \"system\" purchased. Luckily, it looks like he'll be able to get a full refund for what he bought vs. what he got, but it does serve as a warning for those buying from scalpers on sites like eBay.", "While restocks have occurred with more on the way, Sony has confirmed that PlayStation 5 stock is expected to be scarce over the coming months. With the holiday season on the horizon, scalpers are also getting a second wind of being able to sell for a much higher price and nothing is really in place to stop that.", "What is the weirdest shipping mishap you've encountered?
