Beeld Hollandse Hoogte / Roger Viollet Agence Photographique", "The city\u2019s role in slavery was large scale, global, long term, continued long after slavery was officially abolished, and took different forms. It played a systematic and organised part in the trade, and councillors were also actively involved as individuals, says Pepijn Brandon, who is researching the subject for the International Institute of Social History.", "Amsterdam used slaves in its colonies in Suriname, Cura\u00e7ao, and Indonesia, and also in South Africa, Taiwan, Brazil, and North America. In the latter, this involved not only Nieuw-Amsterdam, now New York, but also the colony of Nieuwer-Amstel on the Delaware river, which was governed by Amsterdam.", "\u201cThe involvement was more widespread than we first thought,\u201d Brandon says. \u201cAmsterdam traded with the world, and its contribution was equally global.\u201d He is one of four editors of a book entitled De slavernij in Oost en West, copies of which were given last week to mayor Femke Halsema and deputy mayor Rutger Groot Wassink. More than forty researchers contributed to the publication.", "The city\u2019s role", "The research, commissioned by the Mayor and Executive Board, could be the basis of an apology for its involvement in this dark chapter of history. The council has passed a motion calling for an apology, which would be the first issued by a Dutch city.", "Groot Wassink wanted to examine exactly what Amsterdam should apologise for, and determine the role of the city, rather than individuals, in slavery. It took part in various ways, one of them being the Soci\u00ebteit van Suriname, of which it was one of three owners. The organisation managed Suriname from 1683 to 1795, transporting thousands of men, women, and children there from Africa. Council minutes show that the city\u2019s mayors knew about this.", "The second route was indirect. Amsterdam\u2019s administrators had the biggest say in the management of the United East India Company, whose trade in Asia also included forcible migrations, slavery and forced labour, with the city\u2019s express support. The same was true of the West India Company, which transported slaves to Suriname, Cura\u00e7ao, and elsewhere. \u201cAmsterdam supported this aggressive policy,\u201d Brandon says.", "Contrast", "A number of mayors themselves were involved in slave trading, taking advantage of their office where necessary, and the city council also played an important role in justifying slavery.", "This history stands in stark contrast to the city\u2019s much-vaunted reputation for tolerance, dating back to the \u201cGolden Age\u201d when many refugees found shelter here. Can a city be tolerant and practice slavery at the same time? \u201cYes, and that\u2019s what makes history so complex,\u201d Brandon says. \u201cSlavery is as much a part of the city\u2019s history as tolerance.\u201d", "Whether the research will lead to an apology is a political decision that will have to be made sooner or later.
