The lower house of Italy\u2019s parliament cut relations with its Egyptian counterpart in 2017.", "Yet other parts of the Italian state have worked to improve relations with Egypt in the intervening years, notably the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who in June quietly approved a mammoth arms sale to Egypt following months of covert negotiations.", "The initial deal, worth \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31.09bn), is part a much larger potential sale worth up to \u20ac10bn. The Italian oil and gas firm Eni also invested $16bn (\u00a312bn) in Egypt\u2019s Zohr natural gas field.", "Meanwhile, Italian prosecutors continued to supply a steady stream of ugly details about Regeni\u2019s murder. They said Egyptian security forces ensnared the 28-year-old \u201cin a spiderweb\u201d prior to his death, gaining information from people close to him in Cairo while he researched Egyptian labour movements.", "The move to demand that Egypt answers for the actions of its powerful and sprawling security services is all but unique. Internally, Egypt has long provided immunity for officers accused of any crimes committed against civilians.", "The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, whose lawyers act as the Regeni family\u2019s legal counsel in Egypt, said last September that security forces had forcibly \u201cdisappeared\u201d 2,723 people since 2015.", "Enforced disappearances, where citizens are secretly detained by security agents without access to lawyers or their families, are associated with frequent use of torture.", "Details of how Egyptian security officials forcibly disappeared, tortured and murdered Regeni are likely to further damage relations with Italy.", "\u201cThe public display of evidence that Egyptian officials tortured a student to death is going to be hugely damaging to Egypt\u2019s image,\u201d said Timothy Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.", "He emphasised that this would increase pressure on the Italian government to compel Egypt and its interior ministry to comply with the trial.", "\u201cThe Egyptian government is a regime comprised primarily of security institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be all the less likely to entertain accountability for security officers.\u201d", "The men are expected to be tried in absentia.
