Some lucky ducks might have found tickets to a Broadway show. This year\u2019s most popular stocking-stuffer may be the portable ultraviolet-light sanitiser wand, which comes with a handy bag. It is one of the big sellers, says Valerie Zirema, who works in CV 19 Essential, New York City\u2019s first dedicated coronavirus-prevention shop.", "The urban-survivalist shop, near Macy\u2019s department store, looks like a cross between an Apple Store and a pharmacy. It has everything a tech-minded, fashion-conscious New Yorker could want to navigate a pandemic. Disposable masks in fun patterns and colours are especially popular. \u201cPeople want fashion and function,\u201d says Benjamin Hu, the shop\u2019s manager. And they love the gadgets, many of them touchless technology. As well as cheaper goodies like the masks and UV wands, the shop also sells a $10,000 system which scans people\u2019s temperature as they enter a shop. Another device can detect if someone is not wearing a mask and sound an alarm.", "Midtown Manhattan is quiet now. Most office workers are working from home and tourists have disappeared. The city has seen an alarming jump in covid-19 cases, which have more than tripled since the start of November. Hospitalisations and intubations are increasing, too. Restaurants have closed their dining rooms again. On December 14th Bill de Blasio, the city\u2019s mayor, warned New Yorkers \u201cto be ready now for a full shutdown, a pause like we had back at the end of the spring\u201d. But the covid-19 shop, which also provides rapid testing and PCR testing for the virus, is seeing an increase in footfall.", "CV 19 Essential was founded by Tony Park, the owner of Samwon Garden, a Korean BBQ restaurant. After he fitted it out with UV light systems, anti-microbial film and a facial thermal scanner, other firms came looking for advice. Seeing a business opportunity, in September Mr Park opened his first covid-19 shop in a space where he originally intended to have another restaurant. He has since opened a second branch.", "Opening safety boutiques and testing centres geared towards anxious New Yorkers is clever. \u201cI like to think people are taking [prepping] more seriously,\u201d says Jason Charles, head of the New York City Prepper\u2019s Network, a survivalist group, who has seen more interest in his talks. Yet with luck business may not be brisk for long. On December 14th, even as New York prepared to shut down again, health-care workers began administering the first doses of the Pfizer-Bio NT ech vaccine in the borough of Queens. If the roll-out goes to plan, those sanitising wands might soon end up in a drawer, along with other forgotten gifts.", "Editor\u2019s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter.
