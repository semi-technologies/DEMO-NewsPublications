In other words it was based on false votes. Now you can't let that election go into history without challenging that.\"", "Giuliani said his team may have enough evidence to \"change Pennsylvania,\" claiming that hundreds of thousands of votes were \"completely invalid.\"", "\"There are upwards of 50 witnesses, and this will be the subject of a lawsuit that we file tomorrow for violating civil rights for conducting an unfair election, for violating the law of the state, for treating Pittsburgh and Philadelphia different than the rest of the state, which is an equal protection violation, which goes under Bush v. Gore,\" Giuliani said on Sunday. \"We're at now 450,000 definite mail-in ballots that they separated from the envelope, threw the envelope away. We can never tell if they're valid or not.\"", "Trump still leads in North Carolina, but that state continues to accept late mail-in ballots and Biden's leads in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada are growing.
