On a recent morning, Talley rang up the designer in Los Angeles for a bicoastal discussion, beginning with Ford\u2019s new cinematic foray: Nocturnal Animals. The film, both written and directed by Ford, won\u2019t hit theaters until November 23, but we\u2019ve been given a sneak preview courtesy of Ford himself. \u201cI\u2019m creating a work that says, to me, what America is, and when Europeans often think of America, they think of Farrah Fawcett in her red swimsuit with her perfect teeth and her big hair,\u201d Ford says. \u201cWe\u2019re conditioned to think certain things are beautiful, but if we look, things around us that we think maybe are not so beautiful, at first, can become incredibly beautiful.\u201d Of course, when Ford isn\u2019t challenging the notion of accepted beauty standards on-screen, he\u2019s rewriting the rules on the catwalk. Case in point: For his recent Fall 2016 ready-to-wear showing, he cast a host of women in their 40s, namely Carolyn Murphy and Amber Valletta, to strut alongside the likes of 20-somethings including Gigi Hadid and Binx Walton. \u201cI love an adult woman,\u201d Ford says. \u201cThere\u2019s something different that happens with all that experience in the way you carry yourself and the way you walk.\u201d", "As for whippersnappers looking to glean experience in the fashion industry, Ford has these words of advice to offer young interns: \u201cWork hard, do whatever it takes, sweep the floor, pick up pens, never say no, be quick, be fast.
