The initiative was created 30 years ago by Virgin Records music executive Jeff Ayeroff in a response to censorship of rock and rap lyrics, and who had seen it as suppression to freedom of speech. The initiative\u2019s purpose was to share information and encourage voter participation among the youth. While the campaign kicked off in 1990, the organization still exists today. But the \u201990s videos are particularly special, in all of their grainy and experimental glory, featuring the likes of Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, and Iggy Pop. And while each message was tailored to the participants personality, the message was the same: Get out and vote.", "The videos are still available on YouTube, some of which are compiled by fans, and others by Rock the Vote itself. In one clip, we see Iggy Pop wearing his most signature look, which is him shirtless and a low-slung pair of jeans, rotating on a disc while simultaneously being mummified in tape. (It looks painful!) Another standout video features Lenny Kravitz with a patchwork jacket, his go-to look during the era. \u201cTell them what\u2019s on your mind,\u201d he says in the video. Sarah Jessica Parker fans will be overjoyed to see her with then-boyfriend Robert Downey Jr. in an ad by director Lawrence Bridges. The baby-faced duo wears all black and performs together in an art house style film that taps into the concept of \u201cHear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak No Evil.\u201d SJP leaves us with the words: \u201cIt is your turn to speak. Your vote, is your voice.\u201d", "The most jaw-dropping outfit was Madonna\u2019s. At the time, the Queen of Pop boasted a Marilyn Monroe-style coif, and was snapping and singing with her backup dancers, all while wrapped in the American flag. (Underneath it, she wears red lingerie.) She sang the song \u201cVogue\u201d but replaced the word with \u201cVote.\u201d The off-the-cuff tune had the following lyrics: \u201cAbe Lincoln, Jefferson Tom/They didn\u2019t need the atomic bomb/We need beauty, we need art/We need government with a heart/Don't give up your freedom of speech/Power to the people is in our reach.\u201d (She also rapped: \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, you\u2019re gonna get a spanking.\u201d) The look was controversial and it drew criticism from Veterans of Foreign Wars for how Madonna draped herself in the flag. In response, her publicist noted: \u201cIt is essential that people should vote. She\u2019s trying to get that message across in a humorous, dramatic way. But she\u2019s very serious about the issue.\u201d", "As much controversy as the campaign may have caused, it was successful in getting young people to vote. At the time, according to a New York Times article from October 20, 1990, 10,000 college students from five California campuses registered to vote in the wake of the campaign. Since then, other campaigns have followed suit, like MTV\u2019s \u201cChoose or Lose\u201d, which aired a clip of Madonna and Iggy Pop in 1996. The duo wore red and blue eyeshadow, and had \u201cChoose or Lose\u201d animated into their eyes. (Moss wore a dress dotted with \u201cChoose or Lose\u201d pins, including on cups that acted like pasties. Iggy Pop went shirtless with pin-dotted pants.) Back in 2004, P. Diddy launched the \u201cCitizen Change,\u201d and released those iconic \u201cVote or Die\u201d T-shirts, which were recently revamped by Pyer Moss.", "The \u201cRock the Vote\u201d visuals were groundbreaking and had that stellar free-for-all flair seen in other MTV-backed productions, like Sofia Coppola and Zoe Cassavetes\u2019s Hi Octane.The aesthetic of the \u201990s \u201cRock the Vote\u201d campaigns are still making an artistic impact, too. Most recently, New York-based downtown director Dani Aphrodite, along with the organization Soft Power Vote, released the \u201cLevel Up\u201d series, a nostalgic collection of videos that feature downtown New York\u2019s favorite faces with messages to vote, all of which were heavily influenced by \u201cRock the Vote.\u201d Turns out that while times have changed, the message and influence of \u201cRock the Vote\u201d still stands and feels just as strong as it did since its inception 30 years ago."], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["campaign", "madonna", "lose", "pop", "message", "videos", "90s", "speak", "rock", "iggy", "need", "look", "vote"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
