I never thought I\u2019d say it, but if this continues, I\u2019d say let\u2019s bring back the BCS and the computers. It would be a fairer system than I\u2019m seeing now. This is the seventh year, and it does appear that the deck is stacked against us and the G4.", "\"The committee is honestly undermining its credibility with the rankings. It defies logic, common sense and fairness. I\u2019m not the only one. I think there\u2019s universal criticism \u2026 It\u2019s clearly become a [Power Five] invitational. That term has been used. Certain teams, because of their name, branding, pedigree or whatever, are given the playoff privilege, it seems to me.\"", "The Power Five and Group of Five conferences are relatively new terms to describe the powerhouse conferences like the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC and Pac-12, and the AAC, Mid-American, Mountain West, Sun Belt and Conference USA.", "ALABAMA, NOTRE DAME, CLEMSON, OHIO STATE ARE TOP FOUR TEAMS HEADING INTO CHAMPIONSHIP WEEKEND", "Cincinnati is the only Group of Five school in the Top 10 of the latest College Football Playoff rankings.

I can speak for Louisiana, which went up to Iowa State and won by 17 points. I can speak for Coastal Carolina, of course. I happen to think Cincinnati is an elite team that\u2019s deserving of a top-four spot.\"", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "Questions about the odd rankings one week before the final four is supposed to be released were raised Tuesday night, according to The Athletic. Committee chairman Gary Barta attempted to explain the decision-making process.", "When talking about Cincinnati dropping after its game was canceled due to COVID issues while Ohio State stayed in the same spot even as its game got canceled due to the same reasons, Barta defended whatever \"information\" the committee had to make the call.", "\"Those teams ahead of them have had a chance to play more,\" he told reporters. \"When Cincinnati came out and our committee had its first evaluations, we had information to put them where we put them. We haven\u2019t had a chance to see them play since Nov. 21.
