It began on September 25th when Naga Munchetty, a breakfast-show presenter, was rebuked by a BBC tribunal for speaking on air of her fury at Donald Trump\u2019s insistence that four non-white congresswomen should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from. Tony Hall, the corporation\u2019s director-general, defended the tribunal\u2019s ruling, only to overturn it after five days of criticism. The affair was covered live, not least by the BBC \u2019s own reporters.", "All British broadcasters are bound by rules on impartiality. But the BBC in particular, funded as it is by a tax on viewers, is regarded as \u201cpublic property\u201d, says Sir Peter Bazalgette, an ex- BBC man who is now chairman of ITV , a commercial rival. This makes such disputes tricky territory for the corporation. Its 3,000-word impartiality guidelines distinguish between issues that are merely \u201ccontroversial\u201d and those that are \u201cmajor matters\u201d. \u201cAdvice on whether a subject is \u2018controversial\u2019 is available from Editorial Policy,\u201d they state.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "It has not been impartial on every hot topic. John Ryley, now head of Sky News, remembers a grandee telling him, as a trainee at BBC News in the late 1980s, that impartiality applied universally. Was the corporation therefore impartial on apartheid, he asked? \u201cHe said, \u2018Of course we\u2019re not.\u2019 So things aren\u2019t quite as binary as he suggested.\u201d The rules do not require giving anti-Semites airtime. Nor need facts be \u201cbalanced\u201d by those who do not believe them. Fran Unsworth, director of news, reminded staff last year that reports on climate change need not feature \u201cdeniers\u201d, \u201cin the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.\u201d", "But the rules are clear that viewers should not be able to discern journalists\u2019 views on political issues. John Simpson, a foreign correspondent, and Andrew Neil, a presenter, have got into hot water for sounding off on Twitter. Some journalists think Ms Munchetty\u2019s remarks fell into this category. She appeared uncomfortable as her co-presenter, Dan Walker, prompted her to comment. \u201cI\u2019m not here to give my opinion,\u201d she said, after doing just that.", "Others argue that racism is so beyond the pale that these rules do not apply. Sir Peter argues that, since society deems racism unacceptable, it must be acceptable for a presenter to say so. \u201cThis is a question of asserting public morality, not impartiality,\u201d he says, \u201cas it would be with child abuse, theft or terrorism.\u201d The BBC \u2019s initial ruling reflected both viewpoints, endorsing Ms Munchetty\u2019s decision to say that Mr Trump\u2019s phrase was \u201cembedded in racism\u201d, but criticising her for saying she was \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d with the president.", "The spread of identity politics will make such decisions trickier. Some broadcasters reckon journalists\u2019 \u201clived experience\u201d adds insight to their reporting. One cites Frank Gardner, the BBC \u2019s security correspondent, who spoke of his frustration over long waits on empty planes to be helped to the ground in his wheelchair. It is absurd, they argue, that a presenter can criticise racist language but not its speaker.", "In such circumstances, impartiality can seem robotic or even offensive. Yet editors will continue to defend it. \u201cWe have a lot of youngsters in our newsroom who see the world slightly differently,\u201d says Mr Ryley, 57. \u201cThey say, \u2018Why can\u2019t we say this? It is what I believe.\u2019 But I think you should be able to articulate that being impartial is good for the brand. By being impartial, people will trust us.\u201d \u25a0"], "pubDate": null}
