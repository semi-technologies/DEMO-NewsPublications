Tobacco long has been tied to military: Cigarette ads featured troops, and the culture of the service historically promoted smoking on the battlefield or as a welcome respite from the stress of combat.", "Smoking was already prohibited inside VA medical buildings, but now patients, employees and visitors will not be able to puff away anywhere on the grounds. Previously, smoking was allowed in designated shelters dotting the grounds of VA medical facilities. Posters and banners promoting the ban have been put up in facilities and the VA is alerting veterans through social media and letters. They have also held forums on the ban.", "\u201cThis is a really good thing for our veterans and our staff,\u201d said Kevin Forrest, associate director of the Manchester VA in New Hampshire, which serves 27,000 veterans. \u201cIt\u2019s a safer environment. It reduces fire risk. There is certainly evidence that smoking and second-hand exposure is a medical risk for our veterans.\u201d", "TEENS SAYING VAPING DEATHS, POTENTIAL FLAVOR BAN NOT STOPPING THEM FROM SMOKING E-CIGARETTES", "The smoking ban was first announced this summer. It brings the facilities in line with bans already in place at 4,000 medical facilities and four national health care systems that have made their grounds smoke-free.", "But some veterans see the move as draconian.", "Serving up drinks at the American Legion post in Concord in New Hampshire, Jeff Holland gets a little testy when the talk turns to smoking.", "A Marine veteran who enjoys lighting up, the 44-year-old Holland fought unsuccessfully against a ban at the post that went into effect this month. And starting Tuesday, he will be prohibited from smoking when he visits the nearby Manchester VA Medical Center in New Hampshire.", "\u201cI get the aspect that it\u2019s a hospital and for all practical purposes you shouldn\u2019t be smoking inside the VA,\u201d Holland said. \u201cBut as far outside, I think they should still have a smoking area. I mean you got guys from World War I, World War II where this is all they have known for 40 or 50 years. To kind of take that right away, it\u2019s kind of a shame.\u201d", "Regardless of pushback, the ban is happening.", "\u201cWe recognize this is a difficult change for many folks,\u201d said John D\u2019Adamo, who is co-chairing the smoke-free implementation working group for VA Boston.", "Over the coming months, it is gradually implementing the ban for the 62,000 veterans it serves, including providing resources that could help veterans kick the habit. Violators will initially be warned of the policy and eventually VA police will enforce it.", "\u201cThis is a major cultural change,\u201d D'Adamo continued. \u201cIt\u2019s really been something often utilized for comradery, essentially a sense of community.\u201d", "But even a gradual rollout is seen as too stringent for some smokers, even some veterans who don't smoke. They argue that there should be some place for smoking at VA facilities and fear that some veterans may choose cigarettes or cigars over visiting their VA doctors.", "\u201cIt\u2019s going a little too far,\u201d said Gregory d\u2019Arbonne, president of the New Hampshire chapter of the Association of the United States Army. \u201cI\u2019m against smoking, but there are people who smoke. When they do, they go outside and have this little smoking area. Now, what are they going to do?\u201d", "Jorg Dreusicke, a 72-year-old former smoker from New Hampshire who recruits members for the Veterans of Foreign Wars nationwide, called the move government overreach. He started smoking at the age of 10 and quit three years ago.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Big Brother telling people how to live,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people don\u2019t mind because it doesn\u2019t affect them. But for those it affects, they are pissed.\u201d", "He predicted that after a \u201cperiod of revolt\u201d and much complaining, veterans would eventually return to medical centers.", "CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "Others are welcoming the ban, saying it is long overdue.", "Tony Botticello, a 76-year-old Coast Guard veteran whose lung cancer is in remission, said he often would pass by smokers in the parking lot on the way to his treatment at the Manchester VA. He smoked for over 50 years but quit smoking five years ago.", "\u201cIt\u2019s personal for me,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this will make somebody think about the ramifications of smoking and how some people find smoking offensive.\u201d"]}
