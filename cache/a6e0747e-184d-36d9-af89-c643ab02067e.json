Deaths are also on the rise, up 15% to an average of 846 deaths every day.", "There were more than 91,000 new cases recorded on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins. The university counted nearly 99,000 US cases on 30 October.", "The grim statistics underscore the high stakes of the election, which remained too close to call a full day after the polls closed. Joe Biden has said he is on course for victory while Donald Trump, who has continued to spread misinformation about the pandemic and downplay the threat of virus, has threatened election lawsuits and promoted falsehoods about the counting process.", "More than 232,000 people have died from Covid in the US, and total confirmed cases have surpassed 9 million. Those are the highest totals in the world, and new infections are increasing in nearly every state.", "The new record comes days after America\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, warned that the US should prepare for a \u201cwhole lot of hurt\u201d, predicting a winter of 100,000 or more cases each day and a rising death toll. The Covid Tracking Project, which keeps a tally separate from Johns Hopkins university, reported late Wednesday that the US met Fauci\u2019s predictions, with 103,000 cases, the highest daily count to date, and a daily death toll of 1,116.

As early voting began, Trump falsely asserted that one of his achievements was \u201cending\u201d the pandemic, a brazen statement made the same week that broke records for new infections. Despite the continuing bleak death toll each day, his son, Donald Trump Jr, falsely claimed in a Fox interview that deaths were \u201calmost nothing\u201d.", "During one of his final campaign rallies, the president threatened to fire Fauci.", "Biden has pledged to keep Fauci in position and has promised to roll out a new nationwide plan to fight coronavirus if elected, though Trump would remain in charge until his inauguration in January.", "In a recent interview that angered Trump, Fauci told the Washington Post, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good situation. All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.\u201d", "Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, argued this week that if most Americans wear face coverings, it could save up to 130,000 lives by March. But if people continue not to wear masks and practice social distancing, the death toll could reach 1 million by the end of February, he said.
