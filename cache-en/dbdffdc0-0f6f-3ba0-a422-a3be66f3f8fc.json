snare.", "It's not a bow and arrow.", "It's a carved-out wooden spoon.", "That's the first thing we always teach in survival class", "is how to carve out a spoon.", "Then we go on to trap some

would you say to someone who wants to take a year", "or so and walk the Great Trail through Canada?", "Any advice on planning or anything?", "I could go on for the next hour", "on giving you advice on

it.", "Too many of us do not embark on an adventure", "because we're obsessed with or concerned about", "our at-home lives, our regular lives.", "If you're going out alone or you've got a partner,",
