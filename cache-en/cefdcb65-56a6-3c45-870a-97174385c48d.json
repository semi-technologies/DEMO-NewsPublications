But coverage to this point has been based on press releases\u2014tiny snippets of results that were trickled out from clinical trials. This week, the real data deluge will begin. The Food and Drug Administration has been analyzing thousands of pages of data for BioNtech-Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, in preparation for an all-day meeting on December 10 to decide whether to authorize its emergency use\u2014and detailed summaries of that data could be released as soon as Tuesday. Then the agency will repeat the process next week for the Moderna vaccine. The first publications of the vaccines\u2019 efficacy data in medical journals should be coming out soon too.", "It\u2019s going to be a lot for experts and the news media to digest. If the past is any guide, there will be plenty of errors, misunderstandings, and communication snafus in coverage, as well as active disinformation campaigns on both sides to boost hype or spread fear. Here are three tricky or misleading claims to keep an eye on:", "Misleading Claim 1:", "The trials were so humongous, all the results must be iron-clad. Or else, The trials included so few people who actually got sick, the results must be unreliable.", "We\u2019ve been conditioned to think a study\u2019s size is just about the most important thing about it. That\u2019s how they\u2019re always described to us: \u201cA study of 50,000 people found so-and-so.\u201d But we shouldn\u2019t be so easily impressed by how large a trial sounds! For effectiveness, its power is always about the number of \u201cevents\u201d that occur during the study\u2014in this case the number of people who got sick with Covid.", "Take the famous 1954 field trial for the Salk polio vaccine, which included an incredible 1.8 million children! But the number of events used in the most critical analysis\u2014a placebo comparison involving a subset of more than 400,000 children\u2014was just 143. That\u2019s how many children in the study developed paralytic polio, and it was enough to be sure of the all-important finding that the Salk vaccine worked. The BioNTech-Pfizer trial had 43,000 participants and 170 events; the Moderna trial had 30,000 participants and 196 events. Those numbers represent an efficient means of getting urgent answers. They suggest neither overkill nor risky corner-cutting.", "SUBSCRIBE Subscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.", "At the same time, it\u2019s important to remember that not every number that\u2019s reported will be based on a full analysis of all the data. The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine is said to have 95 percent efficacy; Moderna\u2019s, 94.5 percent. These are the most top-level findings. As more data comes out, though, it\u2019s all but certain that more fine-grained\u2014but potentially less reliable\u2014analyses will make the news and be presented as though they are equally strong. We already saw this happen a few weeks ago, when a BioNTech-Pfizer press release reported that \u201cefficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94 percent.\u201d Outlets such as ABC News went ahead and passed that finding straight on to their readers. But we can\u2019t be as certain about this as we can about the overall efficacy. When a little more data about the vaccine was released upon its authorization by the UK government last Wednesday, it showed that there weren\u2019t quite enough participants in the study\u2019s oldest age group (over 75) to be as sure about that result. It\u2019s still an important finding; it\u2019s just a more tentative one. The same may apply to other statistics that get reported in the days to come. How effective is the vaccine at preventing infection, for example, or protecting people with chronic diseases from Covid? Don\u2019t assume that secondary findings like these will carry the same degree of confidence as the main ones.", "Misleading Claim 2:", "Now we know that claims of \"95 percent efficacy\" were hype."], "authors": ["Hilda Bastian", "Hilda Bastia"], "keywords": ["trials", "efficacy", "events", "results", "watch", "trial", "thats", "claims", "coming", "vaccine", "reported", "data", "number"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
