{"paragraphs": ["Watching Raising Dion, Netflix\u2019s latest sci-fi series about a gifted 8-year-old with superpowers, there\u2019s one feeling that\u2019s hard to shake: This doesn\u2019t belong here. That is maybe a curious thought to have, especially since Netflix, on aggregate, skirts a traditional network identity (its four-year Marvel experiment notwithstanding). But Raising Dion, which is adapted from the Dennis Liu comic, feels more aligned with the PG-popcorn dramas of The CW and Freeform than the darker, quirkier stuff Netflix typically embraces.", "This feeling, however, turns out to be unfounded.", "On a very rudimentary level, Raising Dion works in the same way that DC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl, or Cloak & Dagger do: They\u2019re mostly surface-level investigations; they dig only so deep and resist thematic, structural, or narrative risks in the name of form. Netflix\u2019s shows are typically the inverse; the streaming giant has always touted itself as a home for the boundary-pushers. But what\u2019s become clear more recently, particularly with the release of Raising Dion, is that Netflix now wants to be our small-screen everything. It wants to be TV\u2014plus everything else.", "It\u2019s a noble if impossible aim, because the fruits of at-all-costs growth\u2014of manically oversaturating the TV landscape with all manner of content\u2014are seldom realized. In the burgeoning Netflix era of Just OK Television, Raising Dion is not the exception or some rogue outlier show that can\u2019t quite take off; it\u2019s the streaming giant\u2019s new normal.", "As origin stories go, Dion\u2019s is ripe for symbolism. Newly enrolled at an Atlanta elementary school, he is one of two black students and struggles with acceptance (the other, more popular one, Chris, has a YouTube channel, which is a point of envy). In one particularly familiar scene, a white school administrator blames Dion for assaulting another student, who is also white, despite the fact that he did not do it. It\u2019s one of the shows more nuanced examinations of race and power, and how corrosive their binding is early on in the lives of black children. But then, when Dion does realize he has actual superpowers (teleportation, energy manipulation, and telekinesis; \u201call the greats have it\u2014Luke Sywalker, Neo, Mary Poppins,\u201d he\u2019s told), the show rockets into more unstable territory. In the debut, when Dion first tests his abilities, he nearly destroys the house\u2014Legos and action figures coil into a ferocious cyclone, his very own twister of destruction. The second time, on a lake, he and his mom almost lose their lives when, again, his powers prove too forceful, conjuring the hellish fury of nature.", "The fruits of at-all-costs growth\u2014of manically oversaturating the TV landscape with all manner of content\u2014are seldom realized.", "Despite these with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility teachable moments, the show still feels slight. That\u2019s because it very recklessly attempts to juggle three stories at once and never zeroes in on one completely. There\u2019s Dion\u2019s story, which is about a young black boy learning to grapple with superhuman abilities. There\u2019s Nicole\u2019s story, about a grieving single mother who is trying to rebuild her life in the face of unexpected loss. And there\u2019s the combined story of Nicole and Dion, about a mother and son learning to make a life in a world that doesn\u2019t know what to do with young black boys or black women despite them doing their very best to succeed. On top of that, there is the narrative of Dion\u2019s dad Mark (Michael B. Jordan, who also serves as executive producer), which is relayed through flashbacks\u2014memories that, at first, are romanticized but slowly expand to fully detail how Jordan\u2019s character died trying to save a woman\u2019s life in New Orleans. It is in the story of Mark, a scientist, and Nicole, a former dancer, where Raising Dion finds some of its most fertile ground\u2014but it doesn\u2019t happen until episode five.", "In the kingdom of superhero fiction, Raising Dion is, in many ways, a first. For all the show\u2019s faults\u2014its weak script, its haphazard and predictable plot movements\u2014it understands how static the genre has become and suggests a correction. In the last decade, across TV and film, America\u2019s cathedral of heroes offered little access to depictions that sidestepped industry custom\u2014Iron Man, Captain America, Spider-Man, Thor. However successful these portrayals were\u2014and they were; together, they birthed the modern Superhero Blockbuster as we know it\u2014the characters suffered from an anemia of perspective.", "Only recently were viewers, on the mainstream level, afforded a more robust serving, thanks to movies like Wonder Woman, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and the insanely fantastic Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. Although Raising Dion was created in 2015 in comic form, it belongs to this more recent wave of representational recalibration. I can admit, there is a relief in the kind of thematic reorientation the show is working toward: Young black boys and single black mothers are rarely the focus of superhero sagas. And so, however poorly executed, our lens of the world shifts with their looking."], "pubDate": null, "summary": "Watching Raising Dion, Netflix\u2019s latest sci-fi series about a gifted 8-year-old with superpowers, there\u2019s one feeling that\u2019s hard to shake: This doesn\u2019t belong here.\nBut what\u2019s become clear more recently, particularly with the release of Raising Dion, is that Netflix now wants to be our small-screen everything.\nIn the burgeoning Netflix era of Just OK Television, Raising Dion is not the exception or some rogue outlier show that can\u2019t quite take off; it\u2019s the streaming giant\u2019s new normal.\nIn the kingdom of superhero fiction, Raising Dion is, in many ways, a first.\nAlthough Raising Dion was created in 2015 in comic form, it belongs to this more recent wave of representational recalibration.", "title": "Raising Dion Is the Latest in the Netflix Era of Just OK TV", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/raising-dion-review/", "keywords": ["theres", "ok", "latest", "dion", "young", "netflix", "superhero", "shows", "raising", "era", "life", "black", "tv"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Jason Parha", "Brian Raftery", "Brian Barrett", "Angela Watercutter", "Lily Hay Newman", "Christopher Ryan", "Kiona N.
