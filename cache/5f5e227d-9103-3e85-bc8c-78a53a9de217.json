I\u2019m in my 50s now. I\u2019ve never met my mother but, with the help of the adoption agency that forwarded my letters, she claimed that although they were in a relationship, my father raped her. I\u2019ve been searching for him since my early 20s and had asked my mother for more information to find him. She refused. Last year I found him. We are now in regular contact. I haven\u2019t told him that my mother said he raped her and then became pregnant. He is in his 80s and fragile. I worry what it would do to him. I think it\u2019s a lie. He tells me how much they loved each other and he doesn\u2019t understand why she broke off the relationship. I find it hard to live with her accusation and she refuses to have anything to do with me. She has done so much damage in her dealing with the whole matter, and this huge accusation. Is there anything I can do?", "Mariella replies Give her the benefit of the doubt? She may not appear to merit sympathy or understanding and she certainly hasn\u2019t shown either in her dealings with you based on your longer description. Nevertheless, I\u2019d caution you not to dismiss her story out of hand. I appreciate the matter has been handled clumsily and you must hurt deeply. It\u2019s worth remembering that putting your baby up for adoption is far from the easy option. There\u2019s every reason to assume it was an agonising time for her and, perhaps, your father, too.", "It\u2019s natural to want to investigate your story, but as you\u2019ve discovered it doesn\u2019t always produce easy or even comprehensible answers. The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there, as LP Hartley famously wrote in The Go-Between. Having an illegitimate baby in the 1960s was not the acceptable choice it is today and we may never know how much your mother\u2019s narrative was influenced by the society she lived in. Without access to her history you are working in the dark.", "You have a lot of emotional damage to work through", "Today\u2019s prevalent culture when it comes to issues around sex and permission is to assume guilt until proven innocent, which is not the way our justice system is set up to work. There\u2019s every reason to believe your mum\u2019s account and, controversial though it might seem, the same expectation of veracity is due to your dad. Crime or no crime, when it comes to your conception it\u2019s unlikely that it will be atoned for in their lifetimes. If your mother is telling the truth it might explain why she\u2019s so furiously tried to keep you away from the man who violated her. If it\u2019s just a story she\u2019s invented to help assuage her feelings about having had you adopted that\u2019s equally understandable, though not justified. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll ever be certain you have \u201cthe truth\u201d. Memory is subjective, there are many blanks to be filled and most of us know that history is just a version of what occurred as seen from a particular vantage point. I know digging is an irresistible urge and can sometimes net great rewards, but there are times when you are left with the little you had spoiled or reduced by your discoveries.", "There\u2019s not enough detail in your letter to know whether your father knew your mother was pregnant, and that\u2019s a further layer to dig through. What is it that you want to know? If your father breaks down and admits your conception wasn\u2019t consensual, will it change the relationship you\u2019ve invested in? It will make him a rapist, but at this distance it may be hard not to keep loving him, so you\u2019ll try to find other ways of excusing him based on your desire to remain close. If your mother\u2019s account is true, will it alter the sense of abandonment you feel and that she\u2019s done nothing to alleviate?", "You have had a lot of emotional damage to contend with and it\u2019s common to start looking for answers to such conundrums in midlife. There is obviously an awful lot of pain, mistrust and potentially worse embedded in your parents\u2019 liaison. Carrying the burden of that is a choice. The most rewarding thing to investigate here is your own motive in pursuing this story and the hopes you clearly carry for emotional reconciliation with at least one of your birth parents, and whether you can find the wherewithal to step beyond the shadow of the past and use those experiences to give you greater resilience in your own life. Dark corners are sometimes better undisturbed unless the benefit of illuminating them outweighs the destructive force of secrets revealed.", "I really can\u2019t tell you whether or not you should hold your father to account. Your impulse to find a villain may backfire and your mother emerge as a traumatised survivor of a crime perpetrated by the frail man you now describe. You must choose how far you want to take this investigation and why you want to make that journey; to find out why you feel the way you do and whether the answers lie in your parents\u2019 past or in liberating yourself from their tortured story in order to make a happier one for yourself. It\u2019s not an emotional trip suited to the solo traveller. I suggest you find yourself a good psychologist (contact mind.org.uk). If you\u2019re determined to open Pandora\u2019s box, which you have every right to do, you\u2019ll need experts on hand to deal with what flows forth.", "If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.
