Brought up in care until she was nine by nuns at the Nazareth House convent in Birmingham, she remembers this as torture. \u201cNone of the nuns were deliberately trying to hurt me, but they would tear the bandaging off and my skin would come with it,\u201d she says.", "The exception was when a nun dressed in white, rather than the usual black habit, turned up to look after her. \u201cShe would tell rude jokes and use bad words like \u2018bottom\u2019 as a form of distraction therapy,\u201d says Anionwu. \u201cI adored her.\u201d When she discovered the nun\u2019s habit was in fact a nurse\u2019s uniform, it put her on a path. \u201cI decided pretty early on that I didn\u2019t want to be a nun, I wanted to be a nurse.\u201d", "It was a career that brought her unimaginable success, as Britain\u2019s first sickle cell and thalassemia nurse specialist. As an academic, she became a professor and dean of the nursing school at the University of West London, then established the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice in 1998, to try to address racial inequalities in the profession. When she retired, in 2007, to spend more time with her grandchild, she successfully campaigned for a statue in honour of her professional hero, Mary Seacole.", "First, however, she had to overcome an upbringing marred by racism and physical abuse. \u201cMy mother came from a devout Irish Catholic family and the stigma of being unmarried was so great that she couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell her parents that she was pregnant, let alone that the baby\u2019s father wasn\u2019t white,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I arrived on the scene \u2018a little dark\u2019 that anyone even knew.\u201d", "Elizabeth Anionwu (third row, third from right) at Nazareth House. Photograph: provided by Elizabeth Anionwu", "Anionwu\u2019s mother, Mary Furlong, was a gifted student who met Anionwu\u2019s father while studying classics at Cambridge (he was a law student from Nigeria). Keen for Furlong to complete her studies, Anionwu\u2019s grandparents originally planned to pass the baby off as their own, christening her Elizabeth Mary Furlong when she was born in 1947. When her brown skin made it clear this was not the case, she was placed into care, where her mother continued to visit her.", "At her children\u2019s home, Anionwu\u2019s skin colour made her an outsider. She yearned for the traditional middle-class home life she saw in children\u2019s books such as Janet and John. \u201cThings happened all the time that made me aware I was different. Nobody in the convent knew how to deal with my hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember a missionary nun coming in to give us a talk about poverty in Africa, which made me feel really embarrassed, because some of the other children were pointing at me and laughing.\u201d", "One day, Anionwu decided to put an end to the teasing \u2013 scrubbing her face and arms over and over with carbolic soap to make it appear the same light shade as the other children\u2019s \u2013 aggravating her eczema in the process. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for a number of years that I would feel comfortable being brown-skinned,\u201d she says.", "Anionwu aged 11, in Wallasey. Photograph: provided by Elizabeth Anionwu", "The nuns were strict, says Anionwu. \u201cI was a bedwetter and was punished for it,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to stand on a chair with my urine-soaked sheet draped over me and my arms held out straight. If they dropped, a nun would whack you with a ruler.\u201d Even at a young age, Anionwu understood that this practice was needlessly cruel and unlikely to produce the desired outcome. But it taught her that people with problems often needed psychological as well as physical comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s a straightforward objective, but it can be difficult to achieve at times,\u201d she says.", "At nine, her mother, who was now married, brought Anionwu home. But her stepfather was mocked by his friends for having a mixed-race stepdaughter and became physically abusive. Anionwu was sent to live in Wallasey, Merseyside, with her grandparents, where she stayed until she was 16.", "At 17, she applied to several London teaching hospitals, including St Thomas\u2019, to train as a nurse. Despite having seven good grades at O-level \u2013 well beyond the minimum requirement \u2013 she did not receive a single reply. \u201cAt the time, application forms required a profile photo and details of your father\u2019s occupation \u2013 which I left blank,\u201d she says. The combination of being black and not knowing her father tanked her applications, she believes.", "Eventually, she was accepted as a student nurse at Paddington General hospital, but those initial rejections inspired a lifelong impatience with institutional injustice, which has landed her in trouble \u2013 \u201cnot least when I was studying to be a health visitor\u201d.", "In the early 70s, local authority workers were obliged to record how many of the families they saw were from the \u201cNew Commonwealth\u201d. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what New Commonwealth meant, so I asked and, of course, got a number of completely different definitions \u2013 everything from \u2018people with foreign names\u2019 to \u2018people like you, dear\u2019.\u201d Anionwu learned that funding had been set aside for local authorities to provide services for migrants from south Asia, the Caribbean and east Africa \u2013 except there were no such services. Anionwu raised this with her supervisor, only to be failed for having a poor attitude. \u201cI probably was rude at times, but it was definitely because I was challenging them on their treatment of black- and brown-skinned families,\u201d she says. \u201cThank goodness I had a strong network of people who could vouch for me and I passed on appeal.\u201d", "It is not lost on Anionwu that her struggle against discrimination in the NHS reflected the paradigm shift in UK race relations taking place at the time \u2013 yet, with no connection to black communities, she understood little about it. \u201cThis was happening around the same time as Mangrove [the high-profile trial of black activists in 1970 that prompted judicial acknowledgment of \u2018evidence of racial hatred\u2019 in the Metropolitan police], but I had a general blindness to race issues, because I still didn\u2019t know my father.\u201d", "Anionwu as a staff nurse in 1968. Photograph: provided by Elizabeth Anionwu", "Everything changed in March 1972, when she wrote to her mother to ask about him. \u201cGrowing up, nobody ever talked about my father,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know his name \u2013 Lawrence Odiatu Anionwu \u2013 until I was 24.\u201d For three months she did nothing with the information. But she worked up the courage to ask a man she knew, through the Caribbean Overseas Association in west London, if he recognised the name. The man was John Roberts, a Sierra Leonean barrister who became England and Wales\u2019s first black QC. He said he would investigate. A couple of days later, he rang to say he had just spoken to her father. Anionwu was confused, assuming he meant in Nigeria. But no: he was half an hour\u2019s drive away in north London.", "Although she felt \u201cdizzy and faint\u201d, she resolved to meet him the next day. \u201cAs soon as he opened the door, I knew he was my father. He immediately gave me the most enormous hug,\u201d she says. \u201cI would say to any parent meeting their child \u2013 or adult child \u2013 for the first time, that\u2019s what you have to do. Children in that position are always frightened of rejection and being embraced like that felt like acceptance. From then on, I became much more confident and proud in who I was.\u201d", "Anionwu knew her father for only eight years; he died in 1980, aged 59. But the relationship left a lasting mark: \u201cWe liked the same music and we would send each other books. It was very loving.\u201d In 1973, she travelled with him to Nigeria. \u201cHe showed me off in front of his relatives and I was accepted as Anionwu\u2019s daughter and not constantly made to feel different because of my skin colour.\u201d", "After a life being defined as different and fatherless, now she was neither. In 1976, she changed her name to Elizabeth Nneka Anionwu. \u201cI had a first name which was given to me by my mother and I now had my father\u2019s surname. It was something I needed to do to make my identity whole and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\u201d", "Anionwu (centre) with Dorothy Boswell and Lonzie L Jones of the US\u2019s National Association for Sickle Cell Disease in 1977. Photograph: Guy Crowder", "Her Nigerian family also had a professional impact. One of Anionwu\u2019s cousins had sickle cell anaemia, a blood condition that is particularly common in people of African or Caribbean heritage. Symptoms include heightened susceptibility to infections and painful episodes known as crises, which occur when the patient\u2019s blood vessels become blocked.", "In 70s Britain, the condition was poorly understood, even by health professionals responsible for palliative care. \u201cI was a health visitor and I\u2019d never been taught anything about it,\u201d says Anionwu. \u201cI felt helpless and angry, because I didn\u2019t have the knowledge I needed to support patients and families who were suffering.\u201d", "She attended a lunchtime talk by a consultant haematologist, Misha Brozovic, to learn more about it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop asking questions and at the end of the second talk she chased me down the corridor and asked if I\u2019d be interested in working with her.\u201d", "If you take black and minority workers off the frontline, then you don\u2019t have an NHS", "Anionwu and Brozovic helped to raise the profile of the condition and, in 1979, set up the Brent Sickle Cell and Thalassemia Information, Screening and Counselling Centre in two rooms in Willesden hospital in north-west London. It became the model for 30 further centres. \u201cFor six years, I was Britain\u2019s first and only sickle cell nurse specialist,\u201d says Anionwu. \u201cPeople in the NHS didn\u2019t see sickle cell as a significant public health issue and I was told numerous times: \u2018Oh well, it only affects minorities.\u2019\u201d", "Two years later, Anionwu gave birth to her daughter, Azuka. \u201cThe biggest joy is to have a daughter and a granddaughter, particularly in view of the very unsettled start I had in life,\u201d she says. However, Anionwu\u2019s relationship with Azuka\u2019s father quickly broke down. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose to become a single parent but, unlike my mother, I was lucky that my family, friends and boss were so supportive,\u201d she says.", "Forty years on, Anionwu, Brozovic and others have dramatically improved awareness of sickle cell disease within the NHS, but its treatment is still underfunded compared with other inherited conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, which affect white people at higher rates. \u201cSickle cell has more cases and gets less funding, so there\u2019s still an inequality there,\u201d says Anionwu.", "In 1998, she established the Mary Seacole Centre. It was, she says, a way to challenge the \u201cpredominantly white, Eurocentric focus of nursing recruitment, education and research\u201d. The centre offered a framework for student nurses to learn about conditions such as sickle cell and ran campaigns to increase the number of nurses from minority ethnic backgrounds.", "Anionwu (centre) at the unveiling in 2016 of Martin Jennings\u2019 Mary Seacole statue outside St Thomas\u2019 hospital. Photograph: Nick Savage/Alamy", "Inequalities in the NHS have been thrown into sharp relief by the Covid pandemic, which disproportionately affects black and minority ethnic people. While calling for extra protection for all frontline workers, she says risk assessments should place greater emphasis on the ethnicity of staff. \u201cIf you take black and minority workers off the frontline, then you don\u2019t have an NHS,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know now that staff with comorbidities or high blood pressure are more susceptible and we can\u2019t allow them to be exposed.\u201d", "With NHS staff taking on ever greater risks this year, Anionwu laments the disconnect between the high esteem in which nurses are held and their pay. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good saying clap for carers, but it\u2019s time to pay them,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen Covid broke in March and was hitting us badly, money was quite rightly found for equipment and increases to hospital capacity. But if the government could borrow for those things, why can\u2019t it borrow for nurses and midwives now?\u201d", "Although Anionwu retired in 2007, she did not stop campaigning. Her focus shifted to spreading awareness of Seacole \u2013 the Victorian nurse of Jamaican and Scottish parentage who has inspired Anionwu since she read her autobiography in the mid-80s \u2013 and she became vice-chair of the Mary Seacole Memorial Statue Appeal. But Seacole was little known at the time, even among nurses, and the groups efforts often looked doomed to fail, not least due to an opposition campaign led by the Florence Nightingale Society. It took 12 years, but they managed to raise more than \u00a3500,000. A statue of Seacole was unveiled in the grounds of St Thomas\u2019 hospital in June 2016.", "Since then, Anionwu has written a memoir, Mixed Blessings from a Cambridge Union, which she self-published in 2016 (an updated version will be published next year with the title Dreams from My Mother). \u201cWriting it really made me reflect on how there were always people who made sure the right doors were open,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really can\u2019t overestimate the importance of keeping them ajar for the next person who needs a leg up.\u201d", "Awards and honours have flowed in, including honorary doctorates from St Andrews and Birmingham City universities, the Pride of Britain lifetime achievement award and, in 2017, a damehood for services to nursing. Anionwu says she finds such attention \u201cembarrassing at times\u201d; she has turned down honours in the past, notably an MBE, in 1985. While she did so primarily because of the government\u2019s lack of investment in sickle cell services, she also felt uncomfortable about accepting an award that referenced Britain\u2019s imperial past. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s got concerns about the fact that \u2018Empire\u2019 is on the end of it. For goodness sake, you\u2019d think somebody would be able to find another word that starts with \u2018E\u2019.\u201d she says.", "When she reluctantly accepted a CBE a decade and a half later, she received a congratulation card with the message: \u201cI know you\u2019re in two minds about all this, but what CBE stands for in your case is cool, black and exceptional.\u201d", "\u201cAnd I thought: You know, I think I can cope with it now!\u201d"], "authors": ["Alex Mistlin"], "keywords": ["father", "fairer", "fought", "woman", "nhs", "anionwu", "mary", "nurses", "cell", "black", "elizabeth", "exceptional", "mother", "didnt", "seacole", "sickle", "cool"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
