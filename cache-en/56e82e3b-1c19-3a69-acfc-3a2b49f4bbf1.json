Created in the arid beauty of Joshua Tree in California, it has proven a cult hit devoured by readers from Los Angeles to London.", "The Desert Oracle is deliberately old school. The magazine has no meaningful online presence. And its founder, Ken Layne, wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.", "Both a would-be desert sage and a savvy critic of today\u2019s media landscape, Layne cuts a singular figure. He has journeyed from the cutting edge of internet journalism and out the other side to create an analog product people can open, touch and get lost in.", "Born in New Orleans and raised in Phoenix, Layne carved out an impressive new media career, mastering the vicious internet snark that made Gawker and Wonkette (which he once owned) among the most influential new media businesses of the early naughts.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Desert Oracle cover for spring 2016. Photograph: Ken Layne", "All too aware he had played no small part in ushering in the last \u201cnew wave\u201d of journalism, obsessed with internet celebrity, data and Facebook likes, one day Layne literally turned his back on it all and headed west to do penance in the desert. Never again would he touch a click-baiting website. It was a bold move that has made him something of a cult figure in media circles, where journalists constantly fret about the future of their industry.", "This month the magazine makes a step towards the mainstream with the publication of the Desert Oracle\u2019s first compilation of weird tales. A book that Layne hopes will not only entertain \u2013 and chill \u2013 but also help save the wilderness he loves.", "Layne\u2019s desert wanderings have rewarded him too, not just with a new chapter in his career but with some strange encounters of his own, ones that could come straight out of the pages his magazine.", "\u2022\u2022\u2022", "Last month, I made the pilgrimage to Joshua Tree to meet Layne. Arriving in a car whose license plate read D ORACLE, Layne emerged from the vehicle in a long, black bandanna face mask covering most of his increasingly biblical beard.", "A fresh-faced 55, with a black nimbus of hair and glittering eyes, Layne has nailed a \u201cNick Cave goes hiking\u201d vibe. He needs another decade baking in the sun to go full Simon of the Desert, but he\u2019s on his way.", "Layne will have been in Joshua Tree for 13 years in January, but his love of the desert goes back to his childhood in Phoenix. \u201cMy dad was not a fan,\u201d he says. His grandfather had been a miner and the dry air was supposed to help with black lung. \u201cIf you had money they would send you to Palm Springs or Santa Fe but if you were a coalminer \u2026\u201d His family dreamed of the beach \u2013 the desert was something \u201cyou suffered through\u201d.", "At a desert science camp when he was a kid, he discovered not everybody \u201csuffered\u201d the desert, some people loved it. \u201cThat was the first time I had been around people who had affection for the climate, the ecosystem. I had never been around adults who weren\u2019t just bitching about the heat and the scorpions and the black widows.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ken Layne: \u2018I had never been around adults who weren\u2019t just bitching about the heat and the scorpions.\u2019 Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian", "As soon as he got his license to drive, he headed for Death Valley, Joshua Tree, into Utah, northern Nevada. In the local Phoenix library, he found a copy of environmentalist and essayist Edward Abbey\u2019s Desert Solitaire, based on Abbey\u2019s activities as a park ranger at what is now Arches national park in Utah. \u201cIt was like a light turned on. I thought, \u2018My God, there\u2019s some scheme where you can write about the desert and live in the desert. This guy sounds like he figured it out. And then you forget it, like so many things when you are a kid.\u201d", "But Abbey\u2019s long desert shadow followed him. Living in Prague and working as a journalist in the early 1990s, he had a lucid dream about living in the Mojave desert. It was a prescient vision of his future. But first he had to make it through the internet.", "While he was in eastern Europe, Layne met Nick Denton, then a Financial Times reporter and soon to be a new media mogul. The two met again when Layne left Europe for San Francisco, where he had started an early internet newspaper, tabloid.net. Denton happened to love it.", "", "Denton had moved to cover Silicon Valley and would soon start his trend-setting media outlet Gawker. Layne, who had just become a father, reached out for regular work. It was the start of a long working relationship that ended with Layne moving to (and briefly owning) another Gawker venture, Wonkette, a politics and news site infamous for its merciless coverage of Washington and the media elite.", "After seven years, he realized he hated it all \u2013 journalism in general, and the internet in particular. \u201cBy the time I quit for good, I felt it was the absolute worst place for a writer to be. Nobody reads anything on the internet. You just glance at it to see if you agree or are outraged. I think it\u2019s garbage. It\u2019s no good for any of us,\u201d he says.", "To detox, he drove around the desert for months on end. As he did so, his Prague dream came back to him and the idea for Desert Oracle was formed.", "Desert Oracle would be a quarterly printed magazine with maybe a radio show to promote it \u2013 which he now has. The job is a constant hustle. At one point he was writing most of the Oracle, doing his radio show (and podcast), organizing regular live storytelling appearances and distributing the magazines himself, making endless trips to the post office.", "It\u2019s not an easy life, but for Layne it is better than the alternative. \u201cThere is a generation of writers who think that it is a perfectly acceptable thing to accumulate a couple of hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt and go write \u201ctakes\u201d \u2013 contrary opinion on things like \u2018Why Dogs Are Actually The Worst Pet.\u2019\u201d None of it is new, he says, \u201cit\u2019s what people were doing when Rome burned.\u201d But it has left us worse off, he says.", "\u201cI feel like we are post-language now,\u201d he says. \u201cThings are more symbolic. The relationship between words and facts and objectivity and their impact seems to have separated to the point where most of the writing that I see, especially on something like Twitter, is by people baffled that people don\u2019t get what they are trying to say. It\u2019s depressing.\u201d", "That feeling is in part why people have turned to analog media once more, he believes. \u201cYou buy vinyl, you put it on and listen to it. No one is going to message you in the middle of it. No one is going to cut you off. These objects that do one thing well are having a moment right now,\u201d he says.", "Originally Layne had thought the subscribers would be people who lived in the desert and desert small towns \u2013 people who worked in conservation, land management, eccentric old artists.", "Instead, the bulk of his readers were in Brooklyn, San Francisco, Los Angeles. People who wanted to add a view of the wide desert skies to their inner-city lives. He now has 3,600 paid subscribers on top of the copies he sells in independent book and coffee shops across the country.", "For many, no doubt, a large part of the appeal of Desert Oracle is escapism, especially with so many of us stuck indoors. Sometimes the stories are short sketches of the wild and the natural world. Sometimes they involve local characters like Noah Purifoy, the late African American artist whose Mad Max meets Marcel Duchamp creations can be seen at his Outdoor Desert Art Museum in Joshua Tree. Many are weird tales of eldritch legends or strange encounters that are a millennia-old feature of the desert.", "\u2022\u2022\u2022", "Layne himself has not been untouched by the mysteries of the Mojave.", "Driving along Highway 395 to Tahoe with his then partner in December 2001, Layne saw a bright light on the horizon. It was close to dusk and the road was empty. Suddenly a huge \u201ctriangle of light\u201d appeared next to the car, sending down a beam of light. The couple got out of the car and the object settled briefly above them, blocking out the sky. \u201cAll the hairs on my body were on end,\u201d he says.", "He recalls describing it at a family gathering. \u201cI got halfway through and suddenly I realised I was describing a scene from The Simpsons,\u201d he laughs.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ken Layne at the Desert View Conservation Area. Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian", "For two or three years he assumed it was some trickery paid for by the Pentagon\u2019s gargantuan budget. Now he is not so sure. \u201cThey can\u2019t even build a jet that can take off so psychic messages from a glowing light-speed triangle that hovers over your car?", "Psychic message? I ask. After a long pause, he says: \u201cNot like a fortune cookie. I felt like I got a push.\u201d The push was nonverbal and nonspecific but left him with a desire for change, to do something different.", "He is not comfortable talking about this. For Layne, \u201cthe whole UFO thing\u201d needs reframing. Organized religion is dying \u2013 even in the US. Decades of covering politics, which pays lip service to religion, has convinced him that \u201cit\u2019s all performative, nobody believes in any of it.\u201d", "As a result, we have \u201cthis bargain bin collection of mass media folk beliefs, ghost hunters, New Age stuff, The Secret. QAnon is very much religious. A shoddy, organically formed, mystery religion with prophecies.\u201d", "\u201cAnd yet, everyday around the world, regular people are still having supernatural experiences in the same places they have tended to have them, in the urban-wildlands interface, as the firefighters call it. The edge of the cities where things open up. We don\u2019t know how to process these things so when they happen, we look for a frame of reference to put them into,\u201d he says.", "\u201cI spent a long time ignoring it. My journalistic cynicism. I am now at a point where I think these are the same sort of spiritual experiences that people have recorded around the world \u2026 Illumination. That\u2019s what we used to call it.\u201d And an illumination is exactly what the UFO experience was to him.", "Did his experience give him a sense of a higher purpose? He furrows his brow. If he has one, then it is explicitly stated in Desert Oracle: \u201cI wanted to indirectly evangelize for desert conservation,\u201d he says.", "For Layne, the desert has always had a hard time with the tree hugger crowd \u201cbecause they were hostile to it as an environment. Until relatively recently, it was referred to as wasteland.", "\u201cConservation people leave me cold. I love what they do but they remind me of NPR [National Public Radio] listeners \u2013 they are schoolmarmy, don\u2019t make things sound fun or beautiful or romantic. There are so many rules in that world about what you can do and enjoy.", "\u201cThe most fun I have in the desert is going out with a bunch of friends, get drunk as hell, sit around the fire and lie to each other,\u201d he says. \u201cThose are the trips you come back from saying that was the best fun ever.", "\u201cThe Romantics very deliberately mixed the excitement of paganism, taboo, spiritualism, romance \u2013 the idea that you go out in the wilds not to quietly and respectfully count wrens but to openly seek communion with the world. The weird parts of the desert I try to push and validate as our equivalence of Moses in the Sinai or Paul on the desert road or the Buddha sitting out under a tree hallucinating demons,\u201d he says.", "That\u2019s why the desert is as important to the human soul today as it was for Jesus or Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and why it needs protecting. Look at Jesus, he says: \u201cWhen things get too heavy, he goes to the desert\u201d", "\u201cThat is something incredibly relevant to today. The numbing horror of social media and the digital age.
