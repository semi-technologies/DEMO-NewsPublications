The drawn-out election, of course, has been the focal point of our lives online and off. A whole slew of celebrities took to social media to encourage voting in the beginning of the week. One famous name included Kourtney Kardashian, in a hoodie, who gave her best find-the-light face to the camera complete with an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker.", "And while ballots are still being counted, people used fashion as a way to drive political messages home.

Among a splash of leaves, she posed on top of a vintage car in a brown puffer vest and white pants.
