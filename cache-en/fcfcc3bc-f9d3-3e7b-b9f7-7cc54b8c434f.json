With time running out on gift shopping, 26 Vogue editors are here to help ease the process by sharing what\u2019s on their own holiday wish lists. If you, like many of our editors, are looking to give your homes a much-needed face-lift as we all hunker down this winter, consider a sculptural vase by Anissa Kermiche to put on your tabletop. Bud vases are on living writer Elise Taylor\u2019s list, or try a beautiful new serving platter by John Derian, a favorite of sustainability editor Tonne Goodman. Jewelry is another category on a lot of our editors\u2019 minds, a gift that is a bit of a splurge, but an investment. Alexandra Michler, director of fashion initiatives, has her eye on an 18-karat gold and silver topaz ring by Fred Leighton that would dazzle both on Zoom and in a post-pandemic world. On the more affordable end, fashion news editor Steff Yotka is eyeing a personalized pearl and gold necklace under $200 that she hopes will remind her of the good in 2020.", "Ahead, 26 Vogue editors on everything they\u2019re coveting for the holidays.", "Rickie De Sole, Executive Fashion Director", "I think that personalized gifts make for some of the best gifts.
