Take your example of free-range eggs. British consumers can buy them in confidence now because of high EU and British standards. A tariff on eggs and egg products protects the market from imports that are marked as free range but are of a lower standard. In America, for example, an egg can be marketed as free-range as long as the hen house has one pophole; there is no definition as to what counts for a \u201crange\u201d or outside area for the hens, drastically reducing the cost. A British hen house will have, say, 20 popholes depending on the size of a flock. Without a tariff, lower-priced American imports would bankrupt British free-range egg farmers.", "Your supposition that British consumers would prefer to buy the more expensive British free-range eggs over cheap imported ones has already been disproved in the example of pig meat. In the 1990s Britain banned sow stalls ahead of the rest of the EU , adding considerable cost to the production of domestic pig meat products. The government thought consumers would favour more expensive, higher welfare British pork, but instead they turned to cheaper pork from Denmark and the Netherlands. Half the British pig industry was exported overnight, a loss to the economy, and pig welfare.", "ROBERT GOOCH", "Chief executive", "British Free Range Egg Producers Association", "Saxmundham, Suffolk", "The plot thickens", "With all due respect, Simon & Schuster (\u201cBook-binding\u201d, November 28th) was not even close to representing Scott F. Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas (not Tom) Wolfe. That honour belonged to Scribner\u2019s. Simon & Schuster merely acquired Scribner\u2019s when it bought Macmillan in 1994 (Macmillan had merged with Scribner\u2019s). Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Wolfe died decades before.", "BOB POWELL", "Birmingham, Michigan", "Life in the old dogfight yet", "A dogfight in aerial combat is known as \u201cbasic fighter manoeuvring\u201d, or BFM , within the profession (\u201cVirtual mavericks\u201d, November 21st). Guns are no longer used, but a missile shot within visual range after the point at which two fighters pass each other and the manoeuvring that follows is in fact a dogfight.", "Throughout the history of combat aviation many have said that the dogfight is dead, and have been proved wrong. In Vietnam it was because the missiles were unreliable. In the future it may be stealth, electronic warfare, or strict rules of engagement that prevent a shot beyond visual range against a target. America\u2019s shooting down of a Syrian SU -22 in 2017 may not be a true dogfight to some, but it was conducted within visual range with extensive manoeuvring. The pilot, a graduate of the US navy\u2019s TOPGUN , employed his BFM skills that day.", "You also noted that an autonomous aircraft cannot explain what it did and why.

Machiavelli\u2019s \u201cThe Prince\u201d advises a leader how to act. Machiavelli, who suffered two turns on the rack for his guidance, compares Fortune to a violent river that causes havoc when enraged. When the river is quiet, a leader needs to protect himself by building embankments, dykes and canals. A leader who does not take these precautions is at the mercy of Fortune, but if he prepares and adapts, he prospers. Mr Johnson did not prepare for the pandemic, has not built defences against the potential havoc of Brexit, and the protections against climate change are as yet just words.", "DUNCAN STEPHENSON", "Leeds", "Bagehot\u2019s list of Boris Johnson\u2019s traits inadvertently places him alongside such familiar British characters as Mr Micawber, Derek Trotter and Arthur Daley.", "ANDY CHEW", "Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire", "Sitting in South Asia I feel obliged to point out that Kautilya, the Indian Machiavelli, wrote \u201cArthashastra\u201d, his science of politics, around 1,800 years before \u201cThe Prince\u201d. As Roger Boesche noted in the preface to \u201cThe First Great Political Realist\u201d, Kautilya makes Machiavelli seem mild. For example, whereas Machiavelli only cursorily examines the topic of assassination and gives no advice about spies, arrest on suspicion, and torture, Kautilya discusses all these issues at length.", "JOHN CROCKER", "Colombo, Sri Lanka", "Employ more conservatives", "America\u2019s State Department has an obvious diversity problem by employing too many white males (\u201cAltered state\u201d, November 21st).

One would be hard-pressed to find any significant percentage of Republicans in its ranks, let alone a number like 48%, which more accurately represents the politics of America.
