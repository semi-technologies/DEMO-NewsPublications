He had warned Royal Berkshire hospital three weeks before his death that unless it supplied the vital kit he and his colleagues needed to avoid infection \u201cit will be too little and too late\u201d.", "DAUK, the Good Law Project and Hourglass, a charity also known as Action on Elder Abuse, say they will pursue legal action against the government\u2019s \u201ccontinued refusal to hold a public inquiry into whether PPE failures contributed to the deaths or illness of NHS staff and care workers\u201d.", "The legal action had been paused while the National Audit Office (NAO) investigated the UK\u2019s PPE supply.

The need the NAO identifies for lessons to be learned and the moral case for bereaved families of frontline healthcare workers to be heard [are] being subordinated to \u2026 political expediency. It\u2019s morally deplorable and, we believe, legally wrong.\u201d", "A government spokesperson said: \u201cEvery death from this virus is a tragedy and our condolences go out to everyone who has lost a loved one. As the recent NAO report recognises, during this unprecedented pandemic all the NHS providers audited \u2018were always able to get what they needed in time\u2019 thanks to the herculean effort of government, NHS, armed forces, civil servants and industry.\u201d", "", ""], "authors": ["Robert Booth"], "keywords": ["workers", "health", "public", "step", "ppe", "doctors", "action", "covid", "nao", "nhs", "probe", "drive", "deaths", "legal", "care", "inquiry"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
