Such is the urgent brilliance of Caleb Femi\u2019s Poor (Penguin, \u00a39.99). A former young people\u2019s laureate for London, his series of dispatches anatomising the south London estate he grew up on is a multilayered accounting of the lives of young black men. He avoids an \u201curge to exorcise\u201d or brittle celebration; rather he is clear-eyed and cool-headed, which makes observations like those in \u201cConcrete (I)\u201d all the more devastating: \u201cI have nothing to offer you / but my only pair of Air Max 90s. / In principle, they are my autopsy laid out / in rubber and threading.\u201d Femi\u2019s language is restlessly inventive, unerring in uncovering images that lodge in your memory. His use of concrete as a recurring motif is brutally graceful, encapsulating this startlingly beautiful book, a landmark debut for British poetry.", "Inua Ellams, The Actual", "The first full collection by Inua Ellams, The Actual (Penned in the Margins, \u00a39.99), bristles with energy, reflecting how these poems were written, directly on to his phone in moments grabbed while travelling, between meetings, before sleeping, while sleeping: \u201cHave you exploded awake / at the 4am forge of darkest night / to your heart\u2019s brutish beating / and to calm the raging bull of it / tried focusing on anything / the nearest pencil\u2019s nascent point\u201d. The square lyrics, prose-like in appearance, are consistently vivid, whether Ellams is taking on the biggest of subjects \u2013 Shakespeare, Trump, empire \u2013 or ruminating on quieter, more tender moments, especially on the endless failings of men: \u201cAnd story by story / myth by myth / urban legend by urban legend / locker room talk by locker room talk / men make other men\u201d.", "Sumita Chakraborty\u2019s Arrow (Carcanet, \u00a310.99) is a book of fables, elegies and sequences searching for answers. Built around the epic \u201cDear, beloved\u201d, a long poem about her late sister, she bridges time, loss and the universe with a tone that is consistently engaging and inviting. It is a book to hold close, an amulet that transmutes the intensities of grief into something uplifting, the attempt to keep hold of wonder: \u201cWhen my body showed me sadness / and began there to outline and diagram the word, / another definition was noun, a chorus of brass instruments\u201d. She tells us: the heart is a target you must leave open to be pierced, if you want to live.", "Edited by Alice Oswald and Paul Keegan, Gigantic Cinema: A Weather Anthology (Jonathan Cape, \u00a314.99) is not a traditional collection of meteorologically inspired verse. Instead, 300 poems and prose extracts from sources as varied as Ovid, Joan Didion, Frank O\u2019Hara, Sei Shonagon, Virginia Woolf (who provides the title) and Blade Runner are arranged to create a commonplace book that suggests, to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, weather did not exist until art invented it. By relegating the authors to the foot of the page, Oswald and Keegan\u2019s juxtapositions between fog, wind, sun, rain and snow \u2013 nuclear and volcanic explosions too \u2013 challenge what we think of as weather. It\u2019s a deliciously playful reminder that the greatest show on the planet is what happens in the skies and all around us.", "\u2022 Rishi Dastidar\u2019s latest collection is Saffron Jack (Nine Arches)."], "authors": ["Rishi Dastidar"], "keywords": ["collection", "best", "poems", "weather", "roundup", "men", "urban", "sleeping", "recent", "poetry", "young", "talk", "ellams", "review", "book"], "pubDate": "2020-11-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
