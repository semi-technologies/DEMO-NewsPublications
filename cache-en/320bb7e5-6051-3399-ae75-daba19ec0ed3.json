With much higher rates of underlying health problems, a lack of access to health care, and no way to self-quarantine, the homeless are more susceptible to the coronavirus than other populations. Shelters don\u2019t typically allow for the social distancing required to slow the spread of infection, and that\u2019s if there\u2019s even room. According to the Coalition for the Homeless, the number of homeless New Yorkers reached a record high in October, with upwards of 20,000 single adults sleeping in shelters.", "Designer Bas Timmer launched Sheltersuit in his native Netherlands after he witnessed the effects of homelessness firsthand. \u201cI felt the obligation to do something when the father of my two friends who was homeless at the time died due to hypothermia on the streets,\u201d he told Vogue. A Sheltersuit is a warm wind- and waterproof jacket with an optional detachable sleeping bag made from deadstock materials, factory scraps, and upcycled sleeping bags patch-worked together with a designer\u2019s eye. Its large hood shields the wearer\u2019s face from rain and streetlights and features an integrated scarf.", "Since founding the non-profit company in 2014, and building a social factory in Enschede, the Netherlands, Timmer and his team have made and distributed over 12,500 Sheltersuits all across Europe. Another social factory in Capetown, South Africa, makes Shelterbags, which are portable, sheltered beds that roll up into bags. They come with a sleeping bag and a built-in pillow and there\u2019s room for an extra blanket or even a thin mattress. A flexible tent pole keeps the hood upright.", "Last month, Timmer, who is 30, was in San Francisco and Los Angeles distributing around 150 Shelterbags to the homeless in both cities with the help of local grassroots organizations. \u201cI did a night distribution on Skid Row in LA, that\u2019s no joke,\u201d he said. California has the US\u2019s third-highest population of homeless, over 150,000 people, and over 71% of that population lives outdoors. \u201cThe next step,\u201d Timmer went on, \u201cwill be to have a presence here, to not just give away the products, but also repair them and wash them with people that have experienced homelessness, to give them job training behind the sewing machine. This trip has broadened my view on the issue and what Sheltersuit can do to assist shelters and the homeless on the streets.\u201d"], "authors": ["Nicole Phelps", "Nicole Phelp"], "keywords": ["nonprofits", "livesthe", "backpack", "save", "timmer", "theres", "upcycled", "thats", "factory", "sheltersuit", "streets", "sheltersuits", "homeless", "mission", "supports", "social", "sleeping", "shelters"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
