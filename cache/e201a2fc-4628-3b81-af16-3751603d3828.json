Feynman was right: it has not been easy. Over the past four decades quantum computers have slowly evolved from squiggles on theoreticians\u2019 blackboards to small machines in university laboratories to research projects run by some of the world\u2019s biggest companies.", "Now one of those machines, built by researchers at Google, has at last shown what all the fuss is about. It appears to have performed, in just over three minutes, a task that, the researchers estimate, the world\u2019s most powerful classical supercomputer would take around 10,000 years to complete. Google\u2019s machine is a special-purpose device that was designed to solve a contrived problem with few practical uses. But this display of so-called \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d is nonetheless a milestone (see article).", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "What might quantum computing actually be used for? That question is obscured by the piles of money and hyperbole that surround it. Along with 5 G and AI , it is one of the technologies that presidents, of both countries and companies, love to cite. China and America have pledged to invest billions of dollars in it. There is excited talk of a race, and of the riches and power that await the first to seize the \u201cHoly Grail of computing\u201d.", "Despite the breathlessness, quantum computers are not magical. A rich body of theoretical work proves that they will be potent, but limited. For all the talk of supremacy, quantum computers are not superior in every regard to their classical cousins. Indeed for many tasks they will offer little improvement. Yet for some problems\u2014but only some\u2014clever programmers or mathematicians can create algorithms that exploit the machines\u2019 quantum capabilities. In those special cases, quantum computers offer huge gains, crunching tasks that would otherwise take years or millennia down to minutes or seconds.", "Several of these algorithms have been developed. They offer a glimpse of where quantum computers might excel. In encryption, for example, a quantum machine could quickly untangle the complex maths that underlies much of the scrambling that protects information online. A world with powerful quantum computers, in other words, is one in which much of today\u2019s cyber-security unravels. Tech firms and governments are investigating new foundations for encryption that are not known to be susceptible to quantum computers. But deploying them will be the work of decades.", "As Feynman pointed out, classical computers struggle to simulate the quantum-mechanical processes that underpin physics and chemistry. Quantum computers could do so with aplomb, a useful trick for developing everything from pharmaceuticals to petrochemicals. Their ability to solve optimisation problems could help financial firms improve their trading algorithms. Artificial-intelligence researchers hope that quantum computers could offer a boost to their algorithms, too.", "For now, though, all that lies in the future. Google\u2019s machine is best thought of as a Sputnik moment. By itself, Sputnik did nothing but orbit Earth while beeping. But it proved a concept, and grabbed the world\u2019s attention. Google\u2019s accomplishment is one in the eye for quantum-computing sceptics. It strongly suggests the promise of quantum technology can be realised in practice as well as theory. And it will draw even more money and attention to a red-hot field. A great deal of engineering work remains before quantum computers can be used for real-world tasks. But that day has suddenly got closer. \u25a0"], "pubDate": null}
