Depending on where you\u2019re located, first you had to close, then you got to open, then you had to close again. Over 100,000 establishments have shuttered either permanently or long term since March, according to recent numbers from the National Restaurant Association. For those that are managing to survive, takeout is now an essential part of the business model. That means figuring out how to make nice meals travel well, and some restaurants, bars, and even technology companies have figured out how to make their offerings shippable, shelf-stable, and more broadly applicable.", "Handle With Care", "When the Ramen Shop in Oakland opened in 2012, its owners were adamantly against selling hot ramen to go. It\u2019s a dish meant to be eaten as soon as the broth hits the bowl. \u201cWe wanted people to have the best experience possible,\u201d says co-owner Sam White. Made from intensely savory soup, compact and toothy noodles, and delectable toppings, ramen is a staple food that chefs spend years getting right.", "This is how it\u2019s supposed to work: You sit at the counter, place your order, and watch the show. Your drink arrives. Billowy columns of steam rise up from the noodle boiler. These noodles cook fast. Line cooks heat the broth\u2014poultry, vegetarian, dashi\u2014which is blended with fat and tare (pronounced ta-reh), the main seasoning in ramen soup. Line cooks use a thimble for near constant taste tests. Ten minutes pass and your bowl is in front of you\u2014noodles folded, broth blended and ladled, goodies placed. A wise diner begins slurping immediately because if ramen noodles sit too long, they sop up broth and become a mushy mess.", "This is why hot soup to go was a no. The Ramen Shop owners, all alums of Chez Panisse, didn\u2019t want to compromise that one perfect bowl when the pandemic first hit\u2014they figured they could ride out a few weeks of being closed in March. But then suddenly it was May, and they knew they needed to find a way to send ramen home. That meant tinkering with the recipe, and sorting out how to package the dish up.", "The egg noodles were the main problem to resolve. What if noodles sat out in the car, got left out of the fridge, or, worse yet, were reheated days later. \u201cIt would taste gross,\u201d says White. After trials that included adjusting the flour blend and tweaking the rolling amount, they figured out that eggless noodles were more durable; you could even freeze them if you had to. Eggless noodles had a little less richness and color, but that was OK. Another side benefit was, you know, vegans.", "The recipe, already simple, became even more so. Made daily, it includes a blend of organic flours, water, salt, and konsui\u2014a mixture of potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate that makes noodles springy and provides tension. Without konsui, ramen noodles would be elastic, but not firm. Pre-Covid, the Ramen Shop staff could crank out 500 orders a day using their prized Yamato machine brought over from Japan. Today, sales are slowly climbing back to that level.", "They also had to streamline production. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process to tighten up the systems,\u201d says White. Tare and fat are pre-portioned ahead of time. Stock options simmer on the stove. When a ticket is called, the chef combines them at predetermined amounts. No stops to taste. After a quick boil, noodles are plunged into an ice bath. This helps noodles seize up and stop cooking; they won\u2019t soak up steam or get mushy. A quick squirt of olive oil keeps them separate, then they\u2019re folded into a compostable bowl. Then, say, for the miso ramen, they\u2019re topped with pork chashu, Brussels sprouts, shoyu-marinated egg, and greens. The finished soup goes into a second compostable bowl. Take it home, combine, and eat."], "authors": ["Larissa Zimberoff", "Larissa Zimberof"], "keywords": ["white", "figured", "bowl", "ramen", "taste", "shop", "broth", "soup", "noodles", "takeoutand", "survival", "theyre", "retooled", "restaurants"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
