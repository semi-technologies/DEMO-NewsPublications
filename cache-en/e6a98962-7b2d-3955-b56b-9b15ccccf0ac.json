Let that claim sink in for a moment. It amounts to saying that China\u2019s economic output will be as voluminous as it would have been had the coronavirus pandemic never happened. That is not even an especially bold prediction. It is only a little above the consensus. It is no less impressive for that.", "Everyone expects China\u2019s growth in 2021 to be unusually fast. A rate of 8% would surprise no one. Some reputable economists think it could top 9%. This brief return to the growth rates of an earlier era is not in itself all that remarkable. Most economies bouncing back from the covid-19 pandemic in 2021 are likely to expand at uncharacteristic speed, having shrunk at an unprecedented pace the year before. What sets China apart is that it will also manage to have grown, albeit modestly, in 2020.", "The prompt recovery means that China\u2019s GDP for 2021 will be within touching distance of pre-pandemic predictions. Back in December 2019, for example, The Economist Intelligence Unit forecast that China\u2019s GDP would be about $15.8trn in 2021. Now it is predicting \u00ad\u00adit will be a little more than that (thanks in part to a weaker dollar).", "Listen on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | TuneIn", "No other big economy will recover as thoroughly, including those that have handled covid-19 relatively well. Japan, for example, will fall short, as will Germany. Indeed, China\u2019s economy may well overtake the combined GDP of the European Union in 2021 or thereabouts.", "China\u2019s recovery has not, of course, been well balanced or evenly spread. It was helped by exports, which have captured a record share of the global market. Hot items include masks and sanitisers to satisfy the global demand for personal protection, and televisions and consumer electronics to meet the global demand for personal distraction. Investment, especially in infrastructure and property, also contributed, supported by strong credit growth. In August 2020 China State Railway said it would link every city with at least half a million people to the country\u2019s high-speed network, almost doubling it in size by 2035. Household spending, by contrast, has lagged. Private consumption will make a smaller contribution to China\u2019s growth in 2020 and 2021 than investment will. The last time that happened was 2015. An unbalanced recovery is better than no recovery at all. But China\u2019s growth pattern will nonetheless create some headaches for the country\u2019s policymakers in 2021. It has set back their gradual efforts to wean the country off its dependence on investment spending. And it has reversed some of the progress of its \u201cdeleveraging\u201d campaign, which briefly succeeded in stabilising China\u2019s debt, relative to the size of its economy. When the deleveraging campaign was introduced in earnest in 2016, a Communist Party insider, identified only as an \u201cauthoritative person\u201d, explained its logic in an interview with the People\u2019s Daily, a party newspaper. The insider complained that China\u2019s stability relied on the \u201cold method\u201d of investment stimulus, and pointed out that \u201ca tree cannot grow to the sky\u201d to justify the government\u2019s efforts to prune China\u2019s debts before too many decayed limbs came crashing down. Do not be surprised if the same authoritative person makes another appearance in 2021. China\u2019s policymakers need to become reacquainted with how to rebalance and deleverage the economy without killing growth.", "For most economies, the pandemic has ushered in a tentative new world, marked by fragile recoveries, uncharted policies and up-in-the-air business models. But in China, things are different. The virus has instead returned the economy to a familiar policy juncture. Just as its GDP figure for 2021 would not surprise anyone who had slept through the past year, so the policymaking dilemmas it is facing would not surprise anyone who had slept through the past five.", "Simon Cox: emerging markets editor, The Economist \u25a0", "This article appeared in the China section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline \u201cBrave old world\u201d"], "authors": ["Simon Cox", "Emerging Markets Editor", "The Economist"], "keywords": ["surprise", "world", "investment", "gdp", "economy", "recovery", "hold", "2021", "china", "coming", "growth", "chinas"], "pubDate": "2020-11-17T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
