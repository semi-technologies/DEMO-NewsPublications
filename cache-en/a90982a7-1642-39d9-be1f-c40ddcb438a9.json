While the F-35C has already been declared operational by the Navy, enabling the Marine Corps with the option of deeper air attacks in blue or open water maritime warfare.", "The Corps has for many years now been operating the F-35B Short Vertical Take-Off-and-Landing from the deck of amphibious assault ships, now Marines will have longer attack reach and more weapons with the F-35C. The F-35B brings unparalleled advantages with an ability to conduct vertical take off, yet the F-35C has a combat radius that is 600 nautical miles with a 1,200-mile range compared with the F-35B\u2019s 450 nautical mile range, according to Lockheed Martin information.", "Longer range also means more dwell time over targets to enable new adjustments in the event that new intelligence information emerges.

It will, among other things, enable a force of Marines to project air power and attack from farther offshore and conduct a wider sphere of blue-water warfare operations on the open ocean. It will also give the Corps the ability to introduce more firepower into its amphibious attack strategy by operating aircraft that can support amphibious landings from greater distances, lending even more attack options for commanders. A longer-range F-35C for the Corps also brings reconnaissance advantages as well, given its sensor technologies. An F-35B-armed Marine Corps Expeditionary Unit, preparing to attack from an amphibious assault ship, might have occasion to coordinate with a carrier-launched F-35C able to conduct forward surveillance of an attack area and use its F-35-specific data link to pass details to an F-35B preparing to offer close air support to an attacking amphibious force.", "-- Kris Osborn is the Managing Editor of Warrior Maven and The Defense Editor of The National Interest --"], "authors": [], "keywords": ["fighters", "b", "marines", "marine", "amphibious", "f35b", "f35c", "corps", "model", "fighter", "carriers", "air", "aircraft", "attack", "stealth"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
