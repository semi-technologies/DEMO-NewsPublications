There\u2019s no other option. The situation in the city centre has changed considerably, and something must be done. Mass tourism is creating chaos, for residents and business owners, but also for sex workers. Furthermore, illegal prostitution is increasing and human trafficking is taking place.", "A definitive plan of attack, or the \u2018cleaning up\u2019 of the Red Light District, should not be expected from Halsema. The mayor has proposed different options for residents, sex workers, business owners and everyone else involved.", "It is an experiment in style of governing, according to Halsema. \u201cModern leadership should serve citizens and not impose its will on the city. The discussion about prostitution is very much polarised and of moral concern. Prostitution is a historical phenomenon in the city. Taking action requires time and money. A consensus must be reached, but ultimately, the council decides. I just lead the discussion.\u201d", "Each of the options she brings forth is drastic and means major change. Almost everything is possible, from closing all windows in the Red Light District, to creating more workplaces for sex workers.", "It could very well mean the end of prostitution in the Red Light District.", "\u201cRelocating prostitution is an option. We haven\u2019t worked out how to go about that yet, but we must dare to consider an end to prostitution in the Red Light District.\u201d", "But you also suggest tackling the situation by creating more workplaces for sex workers?", "\u201cThat could be an option. Window brothels have closed down in recent years, thus increasing activity in the few remaining alleys. The disorder can also be remedied by creating more workplaces, possibly in combination with measures such as closing the curtains so that prostitution is no longer laid bare and kept from the nuisance of prying eyes. But we can also place turnstiles to block public areas for passers-by who shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d", "You want to block parts of the Red Light District in favour of prostitution?", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good idea; it has been considered an option at Sint Annenkwartier. Clients have to pay to enter the streets. It goes far, but it\u2019s one of the options being discussed.\u201d", "Considering all the options, do you have a preference for how the future of the Red Light District should look?", "\u201cYes.\u201d", "How?", "\u201cI won\u2019t say.\u201d", "Why not?", "\u201cI just won\u2019t. I am not asking for a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 from the city, but for active input from both the public and politicians in order to break the deadlock in the Red Light District and think about future prospects. What I want doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019m pragmatic; prostitution belongs in this city. As long as the choice ultimately meets the basic objectives I have laid out.\u201d", "Which are most important to you?", "\u201cWe must ensure that sex workers can work safely and independently. The women behind the windows have become a tourist attraction. They\u2019re ridiculed, taunted and photographed without their permission. Additionally, human trafficking, fraud and money laundering must be curbed. Thirdly, I would also like to see less disruption for residents and business owners. The area must be cleaner and more peaceful and livable than it is now. Relocating prostitution to other parts of the city is another option.\u201d", "Are you going to allow window brothels to sign up in new neighbourhoods such as Havenstad, Sluisbuurt or IJburg Strandeiland?", "\u201cPossibly. Perhaps as prostitution hotels where sex workers can rent a room only visited by those making use of their services.\u201d", "Accommodating refugees who have exhausted all legal options is already being met with much resistance. What do you think will happen if you announce a prostitution hotel in a residential area?", "\u201cYes, that will more than likely be met with heavy protest. But you must keep in mind that prostitution is now happening in an area where people live relatively safely and pleasantly.\u201d", "Is it hypocritical that Amsterdammers have so much to say about joy and freedom, but are outraged about having a brothel in a residential area?", "\u201cNothing is strange to Amsterdammers. We all have ideals and things we don\u2019t want happening on our doorstep, but in general, Amsterdammers are tolerant and there are more opinions than just those of people in assembly rooms.\u201d", "Are you going to ask the city for advice through a referendum?", "\u201cI don\u2019t think this subject is suitable for a referendum. It\u2019s much too complicated and delicate. You don\u2019t want people to vote on the fate of sex workers and victims of human trafficking.\u201d", "One of your requirements is that sex workers should be able to live with all the changes. But until now, they mainly believe that the local government should interfere as little as possible. Will you take that into consideration?", "\u201cProstitution in Amsterdam should be regulated in order to improve the well-being of all sex workers. Organisations such as Proud are not the only ones who have something to say. Human trafficking is taking place in the most beautiful and oldest part of our city. During the course of a few hundred years, situations have arisen that are completely unacceptable. It will take time to bring about change.\u201d"], "authors": ["Ruben Koops En Michiel Couzy", "Translation", "Paola Westbeek"], "keywords": ["sex", "halsema", "mayor", "prostitution", "option", "relocating", "red", "workers", "options", "district", "city", "light"], "pubDate": "2019-07-03T15:07:00+02:00", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
