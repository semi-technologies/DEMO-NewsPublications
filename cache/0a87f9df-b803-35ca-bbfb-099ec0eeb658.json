She couldn\u2019t find her name on the rolls, and so, with the help of a volunteer poll worker, she filled out a provisional ballot. That\u2019s a sequence too common for drama; many of us will experience it this election. But Mason had recently returned home after more than two years in prison, having been convicted of tax fraud, a nonviolent felony. She didn\u2019t believe that she was ineligible to vote. A few months later, she was arrested, and faced the prospect of five more years in prison, for fraudulent voting.", "\u201cWhy Would I Dare: The Trial of Crystal Mason,\u201d a reading directed by Tyler Thomas, presented by the Commissary, Rattlestick Playwrights Theatre, and New Neighborhood, is a straightforward virtual re\u00ebnactment of the trial to convict Mason. The show is sparsely designed. Mason\u2019s lawyer (Shane McRae) and the prosecutor (Peter Mark Kendall) wear bland, workaday suits as they ask their questions over Zoom. Crystal Dickinson, who plays Mason, sits answering in a comfortable-looking living room, with a child behind her, dawdling on the couch\u2014a subtle but powerful reminder of the trial\u2019s high stakes.", "Mason\u2019s story is rife\u2014like much else that parades under the parasol of democracy\u2014with absurd and sordid inversions: here\u2019s a woman clambering back up the ladder of respectability, a menace to no one, whose apparent fault is not knowing when not to participate in her society\u2019s betterment. Entire waves of history, decade after decade of struggle, ardently aimed at the high dignity yet humble mechanism of the vote, fail to figure in her favor: she ended up on the wrong side of the law, lost years of life with her family, and now her so-called freedom is a grim hall of mirrors. Right is wrong. Ordinary duty is death. The trial, especially once the prosecutor takes over the questioning, boffo in his belligerence, is a series of humiliations. A couple of Mason\u2019s neighbors testified against her, claiming to have seen her scrutinize the provisional ballot\u2019s fine print\u2014along with its warning to felons\u2014before defiantly trying to vote. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that you can definitely read and write?\u201d the prosecutor asks, feigning sweetness.", "Dickinson plays Mason\u2019s bureaucratic panic well. She often speaks too quickly or too vaguely when trying to recall her actions at the polling place. The lawyers and the falsely kind judge (a convincing Peter Gerety) try to slow her down; after all, the court reporter can\u2019t transcribe what she can\u2019t hear clearly. What these well-off functionaries don\u2019t quite understand is that Mason knows that choreographed procedures like this one\u2014trials, hearings, arraignments, applications, check-ins, inspections, appointments\u2014are potentially fatal. Nobody seems sufficiently stricken by how stupid this all is.", "The professionals bend the court\u2019s strictures, so harsh on Mason, under the soft pressures of genteel manners. For them, court is a kind of play: let\u2019s just find those pesky instructions and take a look at the rules. The normal business of objections, sustainments, and approaches to the bench here seems like an upper-class dance, sinisterly comic and unlearnable by the likes of Mason, who grows increasingly befuddled. \u201cWhy would I dare?\u201d is her plaintive refrain. Why would she risk more time away from her family\u2014she\u2019s already missed so much of her children\u2019s childhood\u2014just to cast a Presidential vote, in Texas, of all places?", "Mason, who is eventually convicted, stands in for anyone for whom the organs of society have presented themselves as a succession of formidable obstacles. Here, on display, in courts and prisons, is the unpretty gunk of liberal democracy.", "Watching \u201cWhy Would I Dare\u201d reminded me of Langston Hughes, our playwright of Black cultural celebration and slow civic advancement. One of the many ironies of his hugely variegated body of work is the difference in attitude and affect between his poems and his plays. In every grade of elementary school, I was asked to memorize some part of Hughes\u2019s disappointed anthem from 1936, \u201cLet America Be America Again\u201d:", "Let America be America again.", "Let it be the dream it used to be.", "Let it be the pioneer on the plain", "Seeking a home where he himself is free. (America never was America to me.)", "Crystal Mason\u2014who is still facing the time earned by her attempt to vote and works as a voting-rights advocate\u2014could plausibly sing my favorite stanza:", "The free? Who said the free? Not me?", "Surely not me? The millions on relief today?", "The millions shot down when we strike?", "The millions who have nothing for our pay?", "For all the dreams we\u2019ve dreamed", "And all the songs we\u2019ve sung", "And all the hopes we\u2019ve held", "And all the flags we\u2019ve hung,", "The millions who have nothing for our pay\u2014", "Except the dream that\u2019s almost dead today.", "Hughes\u2019s mastery of American sentimentalizing rhetoric and his irony regarding the country\u2019s actual workings sit in stark equipoise. \u201cThe rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,\u201d so flagrantly on display today, served as a great, gray background against which Hughes could scrawl in bright contrasting color his chiding reminders of the country\u2019s ideals. In his plays, though, Hughes often dangled before his audience the opportunity to hum along more earnestly to America\u2019s major-key tune. He specialized in \u201cgospel plays,\u201d boisterous, schmaltzy pageants like \u201cBlack Nativity,\u201d a Blacked-up retelling of the birth of Christ, and \u201cTambourines to Glory,\u201d the story of women preachers that landed on Broadway in 1963.", "Those musical plays were belated announcements of Black music\u2019s arrival on the mainstream stage. In a lesser-known pageant-play, \u201cThe Ballot and Me: The Negro\u2019s Part in Suffrage,\u201d Hughes tells a parallel story: the long trudge toward true voting access for Black Americans. The play, completed in 1956, in time for the Presidential contest between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson, is a series of monologues and speeches, given by actors portraying protagonists in the acquisition of the vote, among them Reconstruction-era Black congressional representatives, Sojourner Truth, and Frederick Douglass. They deliver snippets of real speeches as well as imagined banter, strung together by a narrator, directly to the audience. \u201cNegro Americans\u2014you, me\u2014are a part of this democracy,\u201d the narrator says, \u201cand our vote counts. From the national to the local level, your vote counts.\u201d", "\u201cI see no chance of bettering the condition of the freedman until he shall cease to be merely a freedman and shall become a citizen,\u201d Frederick Douglass thunders. Sojourner Truth sardonically reminds the men that the path to suffrage for Black women was rockier still: \u201cI believed everybody should vote, black and white, men and women! And I said so.\u201d The effect of the speeches, knit together, is to raise activist pleadings to the level of art; the voices cohere into a frank and only slightly cheesy unity. At the end comes a chant: \u201cVote! Vote! Vote!\u201d", "It\u2019s often said that theatre, given its association with Athens, first bloomed under democracy. My own initial impressions of democracy were a kind of spectacle, directed by my mother. She would sweep open the curtains that hid New York\u2019s old voting machines and let me in on the secret of her ballot. I\u2019d pull the little levers next to the names of the candidates she pointed out, and together we\u2019d pull the big, loud lever, cranking out her citizen\u2019s voice. This was one of the most important things you could do, she would say. Someone\u2014many someones\u2014had won that right for me.", "I wonder what kind of exhortation Hughes would make of a story like Crystal Mason\u2019s. He might have turned to verse again, and observed the stubborn recurrence of trouble\u2014and the necessity, again, for struggle:"], "authors": ["Vinson Cunningham", "Vinson Cunningha"], "keywords": ["millions", "trial", "plays", "woman", "mason", "voter", "convicted", "hughes", "masons", "re\u00ebnacting", "fraud", "america", "black", "kind", "weve", "vote"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
