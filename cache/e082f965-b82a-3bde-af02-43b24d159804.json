Once in a while, though, you get films like 1UP, which uses gaming as a backdrop to tell a more personable story. The underdog comedy begins production this winter and centers on women in esports, and the sexism that often surround it.", "Per The Hollywood Reporter, the upcoming film stars Paris Berelc (Hubie Halloween, Alexa & Katie) as Vivian Lee, an eSports player who quits her college team after enduring sexist behavior from her male teammates. At the risk of losing her scholarship, though, she\u2019s forced to assemble her own team led by an \u201cenigmatic coach\u201d played by Ellen Page (The Umbrella Academy, Juno).", "The film is the first production by BuzzFeed Studios and is directed by Kyle Newman (Fanboys, Barely Lethal). The fledgling studio aims to produce \u201csocially relevant and high-concept films\u201d aimed squarely at millennial and Gen Z audiences.", "Yes, 1UP is an easy concept to groan at, but there\u2019s definitely a good idea in there somewhere. It\u2019d be genuinely cool to see a well-made film tackling the social minefield women players navigate in eSports while being humorous at the same time. Time will tell (no release window is given for the film), but perhaps if BuzzFeed Studios follows the examples set by a great video game movie \u2013 like, say, Mortal Kombat \u2013 1UP could have a shot.", "What do you think of 1UP?
