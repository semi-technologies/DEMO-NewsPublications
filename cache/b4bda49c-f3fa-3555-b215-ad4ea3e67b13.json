Force is being used as the last measure to save the people and the country.\u201d", "Addressing the nation on TV, the prime minister announced that \u201cseveral martyrs\u201d had died in the attack in Mekele, the northern Tigray region\u2019s capital, and Dansha town. The government declared a six-month state of emergency in the Tigray region.", "The prime minister\u2019s spokesman, Billene Seyoum, told Reuters later in the day that military operations in Tigray had commenced, and diplomats reported armed clashes but gave no further details.", "\u201cThis war is the worst possible outcome of the tensions that have been brewing. Given Tigray\u2019s relatively strong security position, the conflict may well be protracted and disastrous,\u201d said William Davison, International Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst for Ethiopia.", "\u201cIt could seriously strain an Ethiopian state already buffeted by multiple grave political challenges, and could also send shockwaves into the Horn of Africa region and beyond.\u201d", "The TPLF dominated Ethiopia\u2019s governing coalition for decades before Abiy took office in 2018 and announced sweeping political reforms. Those reforms, however, have allowed old ethnic and other grievances to surface, and led to instability.", "Tigray\u2019s population makes up 5% of Ethiopia\u2019s 109 million people, but it is wealthier and more influential than many other, larger regions.", "Under Abiy, who won last year\u2019s Nobel peace prize for ending a war with neighbouring Eritrea, Tigrayan leaders have complained of being unfairly targeted in corruption prosecutions, removed from top positions and blamed for the country\u2019s problems.", "One factor in the latest crisis is the postponement of national elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic. National polls were due to take place in August, but electoral officials ruled in March that all voting would be delayed until the threat from the virus had eased.", "When parliamentarians voted to extend officials\u2019 mandates \u2013 which would have expired in early October \u2013 Tigrayan leaders went ahead with regional elections in September that Abiy\u2019s government deemed illegal.", "Now each side sees the other as illegitimate, and federal lawmakers have ruled that Abiy\u2019s government should cut off contact with \u2013 and funding to \u2013 Tigray\u2019s leadership.", "The Tigray region is home to a large portion of federal military personnel and where much of its equipment is located, a legacy of Ethiopia\u2019s brutal 1998-2000 border war with Eritrea, its northern neighbour.", "Some analysts estimate that Tigray could muster more than half of the armed forces\u2019 total personnel and mechanised divisions.", "Last week, Tigray blocked a general appointed by Abiy from assuming a new posting, saying Abiy no longer had the authority to make such moves.", "Tigrayan officials have said in recent days they would not initiate a military conflict.

It can trigger all-out war \u2026 what they are doing is playing with fire,\u201d Wondimu said. \u201cA small spark can ignite the whole region. So I think we are on the alert and I can assure you we are capable of defending ourselves.\u201d", "Nic Cheeseman, an expert in African politics at Brimingham university, said that as much of the country\u2019s military capacity had been under the control of the TPLF, an open confrontation would not necessity result in a straightforward \u201cwin\u201d for Ethiopian forces.", "\u201cThere is also a real risk that open conflict will exacerbate ethnic tensions and inspire further secessionist sentiment in other parts of this country.
