In eight short months, we have become chess-playing, handicraft-practicing, family-time-enjoying, banana-bread-baking enthusiasts of bygone pastimes. And as wonderful as these practices have been for our mental health, this newfound lifestyle can leave us feeling deprived of glamour and self-expression by way of fashion (beyond the confines of an Instagram post, that is). There is no question that dressing up every now and then makes us feel good, but it can sometimes seem silly to thoughtfully plan a head-to-toe look when there\u2019s nowhere to go, no one new to see.", "Luckily, salvation is upon us\u2014and it\u2019s a throwback, too. Consider, if you will, the holiday card. You know it, you love it, you and your mother can never agree on it, and, due to the fact that everyone has been stuck at home for the better part of a year, we predict it\u2019s due for a major revival in 2020. You can FaceTime your grandma, Zoom with your book club, and exchange Snapchat selfies with your friends from college, but no mode of long-distance communication possesses the special, Old World charm of a holiday card with your picture inside. And, of course, it provides the perfect excuse to get all gussied up in an outfit that is destined to be immortalized on a 4x6 notecard.", "Whether you\u2019re hunkering down in the snow or by the seaside, whether you prefer painterly florals or clean lines, there is a holiday card out there for everyone\u2014and the perfect outfit to match.
