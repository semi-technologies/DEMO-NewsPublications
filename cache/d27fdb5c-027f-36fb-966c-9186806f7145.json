Its four biggest lenders, measured by assets, head the global league table. Yet Western banks rarely come up against Chinese peers in foreign climes. That has fed the stereotype that China\u2019s banks are either uninterested in global business or, staffed by staid bureaucrats and stuffed with bad loans, are uncompetitive abroad. A new study suggests that this portrait is wide of the mark.", "In fact the global footprint of China\u2019s banks has grown to rival that of Western lenders. In June this year its deposit-takers, including some of its policy banks, accounted for 7% of total cross-border lending flows, up from 5% in 2015, and lent to 196 out of 216 countries. A recent paper by Catherine Koch and Swapan-Kumar Pradhan of the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) and Eugenio Cerutti of the IMF explains why the rich world hasn\u2019t noticed: China\u2019s banks reign in poorer markets that Western lenders either never entered or are now abandoning.", "Chinese banks provide 26% of all cross-border loans to developing countries today, most of them in dollars (see chart). That is up from a fifth in 2016, and has risen since the pandemic. (Ms Koch points out that the BIS \u2019s figures cover only countries that report to it, and suspects that the true share could be higher.) China\u2019s share is still lower than that of European banks, which, though retrenching, account for 34% of cross-border lending to poor countries. In half of these places, though, its banks are now the largest cross-border lenders."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["inroads", "gear", "share", "countries", "western", "chinas", "lending", "chinese", "crossborder", "banks", "global", "loans", "lenders", "shift", "making", "overseas", "activities"], "pubDate": "2020-10-28T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
