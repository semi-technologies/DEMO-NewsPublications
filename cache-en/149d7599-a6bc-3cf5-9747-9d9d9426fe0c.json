In what feels like a moment of drawing breath and taking stock, international researchers are turning their attention from the present back to the start of the pandemic, aiming to untangle its origin and asking what lessons can be learned to keep this from happening again.", "Two efforts are happening in parallel. On November 5, the World Health Organization quietly published the rules of engagement for a long-planned and months-delayed mission that creates a multinational team of researchers who will pursue how the virus leaped species. Meanwhile, last week, a commission created by The Lancet and headed by the economist and policy expert Jeffrey Sachs announced the formation of its own international effort, a task force of 12 experts from nine countries who will undertake similar tasks.", "Both groups will face the same complex problems. It has been approximately a year since the first cases of a pneumonia of unknown origin appeared in Wuhan, China, and about 11 months since the pneumonia\u2019s cause was identified as a novel coronavirus, probably originating in bats. The experts will have to retrace a chain of transmission\u2014one or multiple leaps of the virus from the animal world into humans\u2014using interviews, stored biological samples, lab assays, environmental surveys, genomic data, and the thousands of papers published since the pandemic began, all while following a trail that may have gone cold.", "The point is not to look for patient zero, the first person infected\u2014or even a hypothetical bat zero, the single animal from which the novel virus jumped. It\u2019s likely neither of those will ever be found. The goal instead is to elucidate the ecosystem\u2014physical, but also viral\u2014in which the spillover happened and ask what could make it likely to happen again.", "\u201cThis is not a simple case of going to a market and picking up samples and testing,\u201d says Peter Daszak, the president of the nonprofit research organization EcoHealth Alliance, who leads the Lancet commission task force. \u201cThis is about what's been changing on the ground in the region, in terms of the ecology of viruses and the social science of contact with wildlife\u2014going back to SARS\u2014and asking what research was done that could have been used to protect us, and was done or was not.\u201d", "The effort isn\u2019t going to resemble movie-style moonsuit-clad narratives of disease detection, Daszak says\u2014not least because, as of now, the teams still can\u2019t travel to China. And, intellectually, it won\u2019t proceed like them, either.", "\u201cThere's a disconnect between what the public thinks goes on in missions like this and what can be done,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s an expectation of holding up a magnifying glass and finding the smoking gun, a criminal law approach. But we're never going to be beyond a reasonable doubt with the origins of Covid. Science doesn't work like that. Science works on the civil law approach: Where does the preponderance of evidence fit?\u201d", "Sachs, who chose Daszak to chair the task force, agrees. The goal, he wrote by email, is not \u201ca forensic investigation \u2026 It is a scientific assessment.\u201d", "\u201cThe team will review the global literature comprehensively and from multiple perspectives (ecology, virology, public health practices), and will do its best to engage with China\u2019s public health leaders and scientists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe team will also invite inputs from those who would like to submit information or who have advanced particular theories or possibilities about the origins of SARS-CoV-2.\u201d"], "authors": ["Maryn Mckenna", "Maryn Mckenn"], "keywords": ["health", "public", "science", "try", "task", "pandemic", "global", "covid", "daszak", "efforts", "trace", "origin", "going", "force", "team", "virus"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
