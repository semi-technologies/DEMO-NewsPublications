He came over and said: \u201cYou\u2019re the young man representing people on death row.\u201d And I said: \u201cYes, I am, and it\u2019s such a thrill to meet you.\u201d And he said: \u201cI just want to encourage you to keep doing your important work.\u201d It meant the world to me that he would do that. This was at a time when support for the kind of work I do was not very prevalent. That casual encounter just energised me for months.", "I was inspired by him long before I met him and I feel really privileged to have spent time with him in the last few years.", "How influential was he on your own activism?", "I grew up in a poor rural community. No one I knew had gone to college, very few people had graduated from high school. So I was fascinated by his growing up in Pike County, a rural community of sharecroppers. As a teenager, he imagined a life for himself that he actually hadn\u2019t seen. He heard Dr King speaking on the radio and just wrote to him. And Dr King wrote back to him and invited him to Montgomery. That was incredibly inspiring to me.", "He was someone who carried that lived experience of segregation with him throughout his life.", "John Lewis had experienced the injustice and segregation in the Jim Crow era and it shaped his world view. That lived experience is very challenging to overcome. If you have actually seen those Whites Only signs, you understand that they were not directions, they were moral assaults that created real injuries. You damage people when you tell them they are not good enough to go through the front door, to marry someone of a different race, to attend school with white children, to be on the beach with white kids. That lived experience motivated him to fight injustice wherever he saw it.", "John Lewis (second from left in the main group, wearing a white tunic), Dr Martin Luther King (centre) and other civil rights activists arrive in Montgomery, Alabama having marched in nonviolent protest from Selma, 25 March 1965. Photograph: Bettmann Archive", "He was part of a generation that were incredibly courageous in terms of their dedication to non-violent direct action.", "He was courageous in ways that we rarely see. In the early 1960s, he was one of the original Freedom Riders and he was badly beaten by the police. Just two years later, in 1965, he was at the head of the march on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, being beaten and battered again. What a lot of people don\u2019t appreciate is that he and his fellow protesters would put on their Sunday best to go to these places and then get on their knees and pray knowing that they were going to get battered and beaten and bloodied by the police. There was an absolute expectation of violence and yet they went. That is what was extraordinary about the courage of John Lewis and the generation he represents. What he and people like him did back then required an incredible commitment. It could have cost them their lives.", "How important was his Christian faith to his activism?", "It was incredibly important to him as it was to Dr King. They both knew that they shared a faith with many of the people that were oppressing and abusing them. They both believed that they had an obligation to challenge people who were dishonouring that faith because bigotry and segregation are contrary to Christianity and the Gospels. They saw themselves as committed Americans trying to push this country to live up to its values and ideas. In many ways they were the living proponents of what we now call liberation theology. They were protesting with a flag in one hand and a bible in the other.", "When John Lewis entered Congress, how important was that for you?", "Incredibly so. When I was a child, there were no black congressional members. We did not see people of colour in positions of power and influence. That all happened during the course of John Lewis\u2019s life. You have to understand that in the United States, we have never had a real change in power. The people who sustained inequality and injustice, who turned their backs to thousands of black people being lynched, who did not intervene to end segregation are the people who are still in power. So, a black person being in Congress and advocating for racial justice as John Lewis did, is not easy. It is not comfortable.", "John Lewis presenting Bryan Stevenson with the Smithsonian Magazine\u2019s American Ingenuity award for social progress in 2012. Photograph: Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images", "How would you sum him up?", "John Lewis was a visionary. He taught me that justice is a constant struggle, that we never really arrive, we have to always keep fighting against the things that are undermining equality and justice and to protect the things that represent equality and justice. He shared his incredibly generous spirit and his capacity for love and encouragement directly with me. He would always say: \u201cBe brave, Bryan. Don\u2019t let anyone cause you to not be brave.\u201d That kind of affirmation is priceless. I can\u2019t even articulate the value of it.", "He was courageous, committed and compassionate. And, he had an instinct for doing the things that had to be done, however challenging and uncomfortable. His life was remarkable and unparalleled in many ways. He inspired people to do difficult things in the service of justice. Very few people have done more to make the world a better place.
