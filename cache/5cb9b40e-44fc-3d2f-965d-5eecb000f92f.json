When families crossed America\u2019s southern border, his immigration police separated children from their parents. Before the 2018 midterm elections he tried to scare voters with the prospect of caravans of migrants heading for America. His failure to control covid-19 has caused disproportionate harm to Latino Americans, who are far likelier than whites to be sickened, hospitalised and to die from the virus.", "For all of these reasons and more\u2014including Mr Trump\u2019s hostility toward immigrants and his taunting of Mexico\u2014many Democrats assumed he had little hope of winning Latino votes. They were wrong, as his victories in Florida and Texas showed\u2014and in Mr Trump\u2019s overperformance lie some uncomfortable, necessary lessons for Democrats.", "For years, Democrats running statewide in Florida have treated diverse, heavily Democratic Miami-Dade county as a place to run up their margins to offset losses up north. Four years ago Hillary Clinton won 63% of the vote there, improving on Barack Obama\u2019s totals (58%, 62%). Joe Biden regressed, winning just 53.3%, en route to a 3.4-point loss in Florida\u2014more than twice Mrs Clinton\u2019s loss margin in 2016.", "Two factors drove Mr Trump\u2019s success among Florida\u2019s Latinos. The first is sui generis: Cuban-Americans comprise a uniquely large share of the state\u2019s Latinos, and they tend to vote Republican. Many believed that Mr Obama\u2019s success in south Florida suggested that Cubans\u2019 attachment to the Republican party would fade. That hope proved fond: 52.6% of Cubans in Florida\u2014and 76% of those who arrived in Miami between 2010 and 2015\u2014identify as Republican. Cuban-Americans, along with Venezuelan-, Colombian- and Nicaraguan-Americans\u2014all communities well represented in south Florida\u2014appeared receptive to his falsely casting Mr Biden and Democrats as \u201csocialists.\u201d", "The second factor explains why Mr Trump succeeded among Latinos in Texas as well: he paid attention to them. Carlos Odio of EquiLabs, a Latino political consultancy, says that Mr Trump \u201chas made Florida a priority since the moment he got elected.\u201d He followed a path laid down by Florida Republicans such as Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, the state\u2019s junior senator and governor respectively, who also did well with Latinos (in 2018 Mr DeSantis won 44% of the Latino vote in Florida).", "Republicans also invested in Latino voter-registration in Texas this year. That seems to have paid off: whereas Mr Biden won almost 1.3m more votes than Mrs Clinton did in 2016, Mr Trump also improved on his performance, partly by turning out Latinos who vote infrequently. Hidalgo County, for instance, on the Mexican border, is over 90% Latino; Mr Trump won 90,000 votes there, up from 49,000 in 2016, while Mr Biden won 127,000, just 8,000 more than Mrs Clinton won four years ago. Though Mr Biden won Hidalgo County, the relatively slim margin helped Mr Trump offset his losses in the state\u2019s cities and suburbs.", "Similarly, in New Mexico, Xochitl Torres Small, a Democratic member of congress, lost a re-election that some polls showed her winning. Ben Ray Lujan, a six-term congressman, won his senate race by just 5.4 points rather than the expected double digits. Pete Saenz, the mayor of Laredo, Texas, believes Mr Trump\u2019s law-and-order message proved effective with Latinos in the south-west, many of whom work in law-enforcement along the Mexican border.", "These results have lessons for both political parties. First, Latinos\u2014a category that includes, among others, white Cubans, black Dominicans and indigenous people from Central America\u2014are too diverse to pigeonhole or treat as a monolith. Second, it suggests that many Latinos are following a familiar path. Just as nobody would suggest that, say, the votes of Greek-Americans or Hungarian-Americans should belong to one party, the same is true of Latinos.", "What is important to a recently naturalised 25-year-old pregnant immigrant from Mexico in Los Angeles may matter less to a Latino rancher in Wyoming whose family has been in America for seven generations. Ronald Reagan famously said, \u201cLatinos are Republican. They just don\u2019t know it.\u201d Many Democrats believed that Mr Trump\u2019s immigration policies would drive Latinos into their arms. Both ideas are wrong: Latino votes, like those of every other American, need to be fought for, not taken for granted.", "Dig deeper:", "For the latest on the election, see our results page, read the best of our 2020 campaign coverage and then sign up for Checks and Balance, our weekly newsletter and podcast on American politics."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["trump", "latinos", "nation", "expectations", "donald", "mr", "won", "trumps", "vote", "exceeded", "americas", "florida", "assimilation", "biden", "latino", "votes"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
