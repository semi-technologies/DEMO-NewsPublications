I hope you are surrounded by love & creative verve.", "One of the pictures you sent got denied because of \u201cgang signs\u201d? I appealed the decision, although I\u2019m not confident in any oversight. They\u2019ve denied babies holding their hands at odd angles as gang signs. Even if it is a \u201cgang sign\u201d, who cares!? How is that a threat to security?", "My initial response to these found snapshots was to breeze through and disregard them as belonging to others. It wasn\u2019t noble, like out of respect for their privacy. Rather like an absence of desire to see anyone outside of my own sphere. What\u2019s the value of personal photos unless you know the people within them?\u2014I thought initially.", "My aunt Kathy was just telling me about how she was sifting through her cardboard box of old photos and found some of me as a child. This prompted a few memories, but without seeing the specific photos I felt a bit dissociated to this inheritance coming from a box I had yet to sort. If I were to pick up a handful of photos from my family\u2019s box, each one would be electrified by bias, saturated in complicated emotion. It made me think about what you said about your aversion to taking personal pictures and the value of the distance between you and your subjects.", "Thinking about that, I went through the snapshots you sent again and felt myself pulled closer. Maybe the relative distance allowed me to confront my story a little less tainted? Like when a painting has become overwhelmed with attention or an essay is too fresh with emotion. Our relationship with the past is too personal, so we put it in a box and ask time to intervene. It\u2019s interesting to enter the past by the backdoor of other people\u2019s photos.", "Is the emotional connection to innocence lost forever at a certain point? Is this what nostalgia means? When we look at these types of photos is it possible to truly occupy dual points on our timeline and reclaim some innocence? We may not be able to reject cynicism, but can we choose to block some of the bitterness that\u2019s calcified our spirit to regain some of the carelessness of childhood? I see it in this snapshot, a suspension of disbelief that makes our approach to life like watching a magic trick: you must buy into the illusion in order to be swept up in the wonderment. Surrounded by family, she\u2019s blindfolded and playing some sort of absurd game, buying into the fun. Anonymously outside the frame those around her toggle through a gamut of perspectives seen through their posture: the kid at the top left corner leans on elbows anxiously at the edge ready to do something, the older lady next to her, barefoot and about to strike up a cigarette, seems to be managing the issues of the younger one who is seemingly exhausted in her own drama, while the girl in red sits fully in the chair, her body making contact at every point, on the precipice of her adulthood, and the lady on the couch with her legs crossed enjoys the show from a seasoned age.", "How long has it been since I was willing to play the fool and abandon my seriousness? To shed my petty misgivings, put the blindfold on and get on my hands and knees in a position to be laughed at by people who\u2019ve known me all my life? The time will arrive for her soon where she will discover things about her family she never knew, things that will change the way she may think about them. She\u2019ll start making her own adult decisions that will sacrifice degrees of her innocence and complicate the relationships that ripple around her.", "When was the last time I bought into the magic of life? Without looking for the strings, calling out flaws and faults or filling the air with my cynicism? What\u2019s the big deal with putting on that blindfold and playing the fool? I\u2019m so afraid of being taken for a fool. I\u2019ve forgotten how good it feels to let go. I contemplated enlisting after high school. I vividly recall sitting in my truck as my big cousin talked me out of it. \u201cYou\u2019d be pimpin\u2019 yourself out to the government,\u201d he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t give a fuck about us.\u201d Although I was selling him crack at the time, I felt he made a good point. Since my uncles were tax-evading construction workers, my cousins used and sold drugs, my mom smoked weed and used to hang around Cubans who personified Tony Montana from Scarface, I never considered the system ever to have our best interests in mind. To become a cop or join the military would\u2019ve been an intentional deviation and be considered a betrayal. We saw ourselves as untrained soldiers in the streets fighting for our American Dream of money, power and respect.", "It\u2019s all part of buying into that same illusion of a childhood magic trick. Despite the details of allegiance, culture or environment, the base mold of a person capable of using violence against another for whatever reason is similar. Every soldier has their justifications. The police feel entitled because their violence is sanctioned and they operate with immunity, even when they kill unarmed people. The military goes into foreign countries with a license to kill because politicians gave them permission. I grew up believing I had a right to defend myself and didn\u2019t ask for permission because I wasn\u2019t the only one with a gun on the streets. The question becomes how we view the righteousness of the purpose. I\u2019m not trying to justify violence or discredit law or military enforcement; I\u2019m merely looking for solidarity with this soldier."], "authors": ["Chris Wiley", "Chris Wile", "Margaret Talbo", "Eren Orbe"], "keywords": ["life", "personal", "point", "im", "magic", "ways", "exchange", "box", "seeing", "violence", "military", "photos", "innocence", "photographer", "inmate"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
