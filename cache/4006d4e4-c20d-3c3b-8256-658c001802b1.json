Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images", "When it comes to getting a job that leaves your conscience clear, a recommendation straight from a trusted source \u2013 a friend or contact at the company, for example \u2013 can\u2019t be topped. But only the most avid networkers have fingers in so many pies. For the rest of us, ethical certifications, such as B Corporation, can help sort the genuinely responsible companies from the greenwashers.", "What is B Corporation?", "Certified B Corporations must meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. \u201cIt took six months for us to be fully certified,\u201d says Emilie Vanpoperinghe, co-founder of Oddbox, a certified B Corporation that distributes boxes of surplus and odd-shaped vegetables directly to your door. \u201cIt started with a detailed questionnaire \u2013 more than 200 questions on governance, workers, community, environment and customers.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Oddbox is now a B Corporation", "Have any companies I\u2019ve heard of signed up?", "Well, there\u2019s the Guardian, for starters. Also The Big Issue, the bamboo toilet paper evangelists Who Gives a Crap and the clothing company Patagonia. But it\u2019s not just the usual suspects: construction companies, insurance companies and a clutch of the food giant Danone\u2019s subsidiaries are on the roster too, as well as five Unilever companies.", "Certification isn\u2019t so niche then?", "It\u2019s becoming ever more mainstream. There are now more than 3,500 B Corporations worldwide, with about 400 in the UK \u2013 nearly 300 of which have signed up since the beginning of last year \u2013 and the movement has lofty ambitions: \u201cWe believe at a fairly fundamental level that business needs to be a force for good in the world,\u201d says Chris Turner, executive director of B Lab UK, a non-profit organisation supporting the B Corporation movement. \u201cBecause of the current structure of our system, business has been largely responsible for the climate emergency, social challenges and inequity. We want to fix that.\u201d", "How can B Corporations help fix the planet?", "First comes the assessment, then the legal \u201cmission lock\u201d \u2013 what Turner calls the movement\u2019s \u201cspecial sauce\u201d. In the UK, that\u2019s a legal change to a company\u2019s articles of association, so they \u201creflect the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit\u201d. In other words, making money isn\u2019t a B Corporation\u2019s only goal.", "How will the shareholders react to this?", "It\u2019s a little too early to tell. Any listed company would need to ask its shareholders to forgo their right to profit at all costs, so there\u2019s a little education needed there about having a longer-term view. But Lisa Stonestreet, head of communications and charity impact at the Eiris Foundation \u2013 a registered charity working to increase the positive impact of responsible investment \u2013 believes the momentum is there. \u201cMore and more, people are looking around and saying: \u2018If our investment decisions are having a negative impact on the environment and on society, what kind of world will I be retiring into?\u2019\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Simon Griffiths, co-founder of Who Gives a Crap", "Are there any listed B Corporations?", "There are a few \u2013 the Brazilian cosmetics company Natura, which owns The Body Shop and employs more than 2 million people, for one. \u201cThey\u2019ve had that difficult conversation with their shareholders,\u201d says Turner. \u201cWe\u2019re also talking to a lot of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies about certification. It\u2019s one of those things: who\u2019s going to be the first? We hope after that the floodgates will open.\u201d He also has an ace up his sleeve: \u201cWe\u2019re pushing hard for the mandatory legal change B Corporations make to be an amendment to the Companies Act, so that the people, planet and profit triple bottom line applies to every business in the UK by default.\u201d", "Green jobs for graduates: what should you study and how can you reskill? Read more", "So is it all about getting the badge?", "Not necessarily. For every company that goes through the full assessment in the UK, there are about 25 using the tool simply to measure their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, says Turner. Companies that might not previously have engaged with the subject are now taking it seriously. \u201cSome people are scathing whenever a large corporation starts talking about sustainability or stewardship,\u201d says Stonestreet. \u201cBut these companies need to know they can have constructive conversations about this if they\u2019re to adjust.\u201d", "Does that mean all companies are thinking about these issues?", "Maybe not all. Clare Reilly, head of corporate development at PensionBee, says that despite Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg forcing us to ask ourselves questions, the pensions world is slow to change. \u201cYour pension is probably still invested in oil. Maybe tobacco too.\u201d", "So we\u2019re not quite there yet?", "Not yet \u2013 but we\u2019re making good progress. Let\u2019s just say this radical and necessary transformation of corporate behaviour is a work-in-progress, but with 72% of people wanting businesses to have a legal responsibility to people and the planet, according to a B Labs poll in May, now is the time for change.", "To search for all the latest green jobs visit Guardian Jobs"], "authors": ["Sam Noble"], "keywords": ["corporations", "measure", "turner", "profit", "green", "credentials", "uk", "company", "interested", "companys", "corporation", "responsible", "b", "job", "companies", "legal"], "pubDate": "2020-10-19T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
