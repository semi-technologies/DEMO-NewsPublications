Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.", "First, BlogWriter shows it\u2019s never too late to read Graham Greene:", "Just finished Graham Greene\u2019s The Power and the Glory, almost half a century after I first became aware of its existence. A great author, he compels you to step into his characters\u2019 shoes and live their agonies and tribulations from the inside. And then he leaves you thinking.", "The Perils of Perception by Bobby Duffy is a \u201cmust-read\u201d, says rgilyead:", "Duffy is the MD of IPSOS Mori so knows a lot about surveys of people\u2019s understanding of political issues. In this book he explores the gap between what people think and reality. Depressingly, the gap is often enormous. A typical example is on immigration. When asked what proportion of the population are immigrants, British respondents said 25% when the reality is 13%, almost half. They also thought that refugees and asylum seekers made up a third of that number when the actual figure is 10%. What is worse, when confronted with the facts, those surveyed tried to justify their ignorance or deny the statistics altogether \u2026 One of the challenges he sets is to make your own guesses at the facts before he reveals the true answers. To my shame, I often got things wrong. It certainly made me think.", "The Gene: An Intimate History by Siddhartha Mukherjee has impressed Tempusfugit:", "His Emperor of All Maladies knocked my socks off and educated me about cancer. This is doing just the same about the gene and genetics. I often look out to the stars and think \u2018How has all of this come about?\u2019 This book has me looking within and getting answers to the same question. How these singular building blocks come to work together to create such complexity is fascinating - and elegant and beautiful.", "Miriam Toews \u201calways brings the goods\u201d, says katcalls and Women Talking is \u201cno different\u201d:", "Here, the women of a Mennonite community debate whether to leave their home after finding out that a group of men in their community has been tranquilising and raping the women and children of the village. It is based on the true story of a Mennonite community in Brazil. Some sentences here hit me very close to the bone and I had to sit back and take the occasional breather. A gripping read.", "Richard Flanagan\u2019s The Unknown Terrorist has disturbed paulburns:", "An utterly bleak vision of contemporary Australia. The Doll, a pole-dancer in Sydney\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, is mistakenly identified as a terrorist after a scare about three bombs in a Sydney Sports Stadium. (In Australia you could blow up the Opera House and get away with it, but blowing up a sports stadium is just unforgivable.) A media pile on, led by a sleazy TV journalist, Richard Cody, convinces the country and the government and opposition that the Doll is a major terrorist, when all she has done is slept overnight with a young Arab, also mistakenly identified as a terrorist \u2026 what is truly disturbing about this book, set in the too-real sleaze and corruption of early 21st century Kings Cross, is that with the current overreach of Australia\u2019s terror laws, which Flanagan brilliantly exposes, it could happen to any of us.", "Finally, NicolaVintageReads brings us an image to consider from Alexandra Fuller\u2019s new memoir Travel Light, Move Fast:", "\u2018Hippos often come up to the lawn in front of the pub to graze at night; in any case, they\u2019d dispensed with the need for a mower. \u2018Careful not to walk up a hippos\u2019s arse in the dark\u2019, Dad always warned if I left my barstool to venture into the pub\u2019s ablution block.\u2019", "", "You may have read Fuller\u2019s earlier books, my favourite of which is Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness, where she recalls coming of age in a family of white settlers in Zimbabwe in the early seventies. Sadly, she loses her beloved father in this volume but his presence pervades the pages. Her mother, \u201cNicola Fuller of Central Africa\u201d is still very much alive and has more than a touch of Nancy Mitford about her. Fuller is unsentimental and often amusing about a tough life and her love of the country she grew up in.", "Interesting links about books and reading", "If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.
