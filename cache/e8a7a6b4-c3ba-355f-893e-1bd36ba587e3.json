How should they behave?", "In August, the Business Roundtable, which speaks for America's biggest companies, from Amazon to JP Morgan Chase, provided a hint. The group amended its two decade old declaration that corporations exist principally to serve their shareholders, to enshrine a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders - customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and last in the list, investors.", "What's driving this shift in corporate purpose? The continuing attempt to restore trust in business, badly damaged during the financial crisis. Generational change, bringing new people into the workforce with higher expectations, and the technological tools to hold employers to account. Consumer pressure, a renewed interest in the investment opportunities in environmental, social, and governance improvements. And, cynics would say, companies desperate, self-interested desire to avoid regulation and retain their licence to operate.", "Enthusiasts for companies with a positive purpose that goes beyond profit are clear. Companies that do not start paying more attention to their own staff, the communities they serve, and the environment as a whole, simply will not survive to be the companies of the future. Businesses that do adopt a broader purpose, on the other hand, will benefit from the reinforced enthusiasm and commitment of their employees and their customers.", "But even the most environmentally and socially friendly chief executive has to generate enough of a return for the company's owners to make it to that brighter horizon. And managing the trade-offs necessary for the optimal strategy is delicate.", "Take a traditional oil and gas company. If, as CEO, you move away from fossil fuels too soon, investors will punish you, even as environmentalists applaud. Move too late and your greener competitors will steal a march on you in sustainable energy, as tougher regulation penalises your core operations.", "Critics point out, though, that purpose is hard to define, let alone to measure. And there are other obstacles in the way of a permanent shift to a longer-term, purpose-led form of capitalism. Many asset managers and some asset owners still seek short-term returns, and are rewarded accordingly.", "National and regional differences in corporate culture make it hard to apply a one-size-fits-all approach without antagonising pure profit seekers in, say, the US, or long-termists in Europe. Then there's the threat of growing cynicism if companies disappoint by falling short of their lofty promises.", "So could the trend towards a new corporate capitalism reverse, as it did in the 1980s, when the postwar consensus on the social responsibility of business gave way to a harder-edged drive towards pure shareholder value? It could. But there are powerful forces working in favour of change.", "Chief executives can, of course, still decide how seriously to take these disruptive influences and act accordingly.
