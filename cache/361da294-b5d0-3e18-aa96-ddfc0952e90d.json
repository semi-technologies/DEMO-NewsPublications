To meet the current moment, it has been redesigned: now called BABY SUMO, it\u2019s half the size and relatively speaking, it\u2019s reasonably priced at $1,500. (The signed first-edition of SUMO became the most expensive book of the 20th century when it sold at auction in Berlin for 620,000DM in 2000, approximately $370K today.)", "In 2020, Newton\u2019s legacy endures, with Vogue Italia\u2019s October issue dedicated to his artistic impact on the eve of what would have been his 100th birthday. The photographer, whose provocative work rose to prominence in the 1970s against a backdrop of the second-wave feminist movement, was one of the most impactful visual creators of his time. His images defined the way women were portrayed in fashion editorials and advertisements.", "Willi, Fashion Mansfield, British Vogue, London, 1967, \u00a9 The Helmut Newton Estate / Maconochie Photography \u00a9 The Helmut Newton Estate / Maconochie Photography", "A controversial pioneer", "The son of a Jewish button manufacturer, Newton was born in Berlin in 1920. His privileged childhood was spent being dressed by his mother in taffeta bows and swimming at the Berliner Schwimm Club. It was here that he was drawn to the way fellow swimmers\u2019 suits \u201cstayed wet for a long time,\u201d something he revisited in his work, such as Daryl Hannah\u2019s 1984 photograph where, dressed in clear Perspex stilettos and a fuchsia one-piece, she bounces a crying baby on her knee.", "Fleeing Nazi persecution in 1938, Newton travelled to Singapore and later Australia, where he met his wife and creative collaborator June Newton, who has edited the new release of SUMO. Newton set himself the goal of photographing for Vogue (his first contract was with British Vogue in 1956 and after that Australian Vogue), but it wasn\u2019t until the mid 1960s that he began to focus seriously on fashion editorials. The 1967 image of model Willy Van Rooy is an early example of narrative storytelling within the fashion shoot.
