This is a war song.\u201d", "For the past six months Tan, one of China\u2019s most popular singers, has been releasing singles from her album 3811. The songs tell the stories of women: a taxi driver, a charity worker, a single mother, a 60-year-old woman who cannot read. But it is her latest single that has made the biggest impact, arriving at a key moment in China\u2019s reckoning with gender-based violence and harassment.", "Xiao Juan (Pseudonym), is named after the generic name authorities sometimes give to victims of domestic violence, according to Sixth Tone.", "\u201cErase our names, forget our beings, same tragedy continues and repeats,\u201d Tan sings.", "The song appears to reference some of the most high-profile instances of violence against women.", "\u201cYou use your fists, gasoline, and sulphuric acid \u2026 Flush us down the drain, from wedding bed to riverbed, stuff my body into a suitcase, or put it in a freezer on your balcony.\u201d", "In October, video footage of a man beating his wife in Shanxi spread widely across social media. Earlier this year Lhamo, a 30-year-old Tibetan woman, died from horrific burns. Police were reportedly investigating whether her husband had doused her with gasoline and set her alight while she was live streaming on social media. In July police arrested a man suspected of killing and dismembering his wife, and trying to dispose of her body parts in the sewers.", "The direct language in a pop song by one of the country\u2019s most popular artists has thrust the taboo subject into the spotlight.", "In response to the song\u2019s release, media commenters listed more of the many acts of violence to make the news in China this year.", "\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been anything like this before,\u201d said Chinese feminist activist, Xiong Jing. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect a song to change too much, and maybe it won\u2019t.
