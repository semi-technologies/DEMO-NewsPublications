{"paragraphs": ["Over the next three years, Houssam Abbas will carefully send 80 modified Traxxas RC rally cars\u2014the Ford Fiesta model\u2014to research facilities around the country. Some will go to Arizona State University, others to Clemson University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, UCLA, Vanderbilt University, or the University of Iowa. In each place, researchers will open their packages, take out the 21-inch, modified, 1/10th-scale car, and begin to run tests.", "Abbas, an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Oregon State University, hopes the toys are the key to cracking the self-driving car. He and colleagues believe their miniature, cheap, open source, self-driving \u201cplatform\u201d will give 33 scientists of all stripes chances to experiment with cutting-edge technology at a critical moment: before autonomous vehicles hit the streets en masse. In August, the group won a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation to pursue the idea.", "Want the latest news on self-driving cars in your inbox?

Google sibling Waymo runs a commercial robotaxi service in the Phoenix area, though riders are limited and a safety operator sits behind the steering wheel. Cruise, owned by General Motors, tests its Chevrolet Bolts in San Francisco, but delayed a plan to launch a service there this year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised that 1 million self-driving electric vehicles will roam the country by next year, though experts are skeptical.", "Those companies, Abbas says, are driven by economics. \u201cAs researchers, we have the freedom to ask the harder questions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had this realization that we need everybody to pitch in for us to build reliable, efficient autonomous vehicles.\u201d", "So the NSF grant will allow Abbas and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania and Clemson University to send mini-cars to 33 collaborators in a variety of disciplines: safety systems, energy efficiency, cybersecurity, and robotics.", "The researchers are hoping their mini-car, which comes out of a larger project called \u201cF1tenth\u201d (get it?), will become the go-to open source platform for autonomous vehicle researchers worldwide. Today, the team sometimes only realizes that someone is working with their car, complete with Nvidia Jetson GPU, 9-volt battery, Orbitty carrier board, and six-port USB hub, when they ask a question on the project\u2019s public forum.", "Video: Oregon State University", "The NSF mini-car project is among several using small cars to do big things. Over the past five years, researchers in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and robotics have used mini-cars to both teach and learn about autonomy. At MIT, where using model cars to teach about autonomy got its start in 2015, students program and then race models through gloomy, circular basements. In California's UC Berkeley, professors and teaching assistants distribute 40 to 50 miniature vehicles to undergrad students each year for a (sometimes literal) crash course in self-driving software and hardware. The University of Washington has tiny, colorful race cars called MuSHRs\u2014Multiagent System for non-Holonomic Racing, of course."], "pubDate": null, "summary": "Some will go to Arizona State University, others to Clemson University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, UCLA, Vanderbilt University, or the University of Iowa.\nAbbas, an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Oregon State University, hopes the toys are the key to cracking the self-driving car.\nWant the latest news on self-driving cars in your inbox?\nToday, full-sized self-driving vehicles exist, kind of, sort of.\nVideo: Oregon State UniversityThe NSF mini-car project is among several using small cars to do big things.", "title": "These Small Cars Can Help Drive the Autonomous Future", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/small-cars-help-drive-autonomous-future/", "keywords": ["researchers", "drive", "autonomous", "cars", "selfdriving", "state", "vehicles", "small", "open", "abbas", "car", "help", "future", "university"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Aarian Marshal", "Lily Hay Newman", "Christopher Ryan", "Kiona N.
