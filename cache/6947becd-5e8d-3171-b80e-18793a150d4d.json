I know the risks involved for Harry and Meghan | Patrick Jephson Read more", "The Byline Investigates website, which first reported the Duke of Sussex was taking legal action, says the group claim is due to be heard next October. The Observer understands the claims made by each group member carry around five pages of allegations relating to hacking and blagging \u2013 obtaining personal information illegally \u2013 and around 20 pages outlining allegations of concealment and destruction of evidence. The claims cover 1994 to 2011.", "Byline reports the duke\u2019s claim could see his lawyers seek to establish whether the newspapers intercepted voicemails of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The website claims it will also explore whether, even after Diana\u2019s death in August 1997, private investigators were hired to illegally target her friends and family.", "Legal experts have suggested the duke would have a problem bringing the claim. Under the Limitation Act, there is a six-year window from when a claimant becomes aware of the privacy breach to bring a claim.", "Clive Goodman, a News of the World journalist, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, were jailed in 2007 for offences including the hacking of voicemails of aides working for the duke and his brother, Prince William.", "However, it is clear that the duke\u2019s claim extends at least a decade beyond that 2007 case. As with the other group claims, the duke alleges evidence was destroyed and concealed and so any limitation defence would fail under Section 32 of the Act if it were shown to have concealed wrongdoing.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Clive Goodman, royal correspondent of News of the World, leaves the Old Bailey in 2006.

This would shift the focus away from the actions of individual journalists to the higher echelons of the newspaper organisations.", "Hitherto the focus of many claims has been on the role of Mulcaire. \u201cMulcaire is just one tiny part of this,\u201d the source said. It is understood that the claim has resulted in the disclosure of thousands of alleged payments to private investigators by Mirror Group and tens of thousands by the Sun and News of the World.", "There is speculation that close friends and former girlfriends of the duke may have been hacked. \u201cThe royal family might have tight procedures for guarding their privacy, but the duke\u2019s nightclub-going friends may not,\u201d the source suggested.", "The duke\u2019s lawyers will attempt to obtain evidence of what, if any, personal information was obtained by the newspapers. This could include school reports, financial statements and health records. The sweep could extend back to include his mother.", "If the case were to go to court, it would raise the prospect of the duke appearing in the witness box. Many executives and senior editors \u2013 including Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News UK, the parent company of NGN, and Piers Morgan, former editor of the Mirror \u2013 would come under further scrutiny. Both have denied under oath knowing of any wrongdoing on their watch.", "In 2015, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d NGN had deleted emails to pervert the course of justice.
