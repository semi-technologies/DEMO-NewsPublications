If you want to stop this, the answer is very simple. The Republican politicians who know better, in the House, the Senate, and the governorships, have to speak up. If they don\u2019t put the preservation of democracy and civility over their own political careers, we\u2019re going to keep sliding down this path.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t \ufb01nd anything funny right now.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Liza Donnelly", "As Americans confront the uncertainty of the next four years, it\u2019s not clear if the tradition of force or of reason is ascendant. Some theorists and philosophers are optimistic, beginning to map out plans to revive social cohesion and common purpose. Others fear that the cleavages will only widen, until Americans reckon with a culture of political warfare that comes ever closer to actual combat.", "From the beginning, the people who built America were seeking to improve on \u201cwhat kings and popes had decreed,\u201d the Stanford historian Caroline Winterer wrote in \u201cAmerican Enlightenments,\u201d from 2016. \u201cWielding the gleaming razor of human reason, sharpened by empirical evidence, common sense, and withering sarcasm, they would slash away at traditions that rested on nothing but the dust of convention and privilege.\u201d", "Early Americans formed literary salons, subscription libraries, and scientific societies, animated by the spirit of the Enlightenment. Benjamin Franklin gathered what he called \u201cingenious Acquaintances\u201d into a \u201cClub for mutual Improvement.\u201d Known as the Junto, it was devoted to rigor, training, and the spread of the printed word, an ethic that the club called \u201cReason\u2019s eye.\u201d", "By the mid-nineteenth century, the country was in the midst of a vibrant literary outpouring. In Washington, orators such as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster gained influence through speeches that drew huge crowds. \u201cEloquence, in this empire, is power,\u201d a journalist observed. A generation of writers and politicians\u2014Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Peabody, Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman\u2014produced impassioned writings and speeches that they hoped would reform the young Republic, giving rise to what the scholar James Perrin Warren later called a \u201cculture of eloquence.\u201d On the lyceum circuit, they travelled from town to town, an adult-education campaign offering lectures on everything from physical exercise to the moral crisis of slavery. Alfred Bunn, an Englishman visiting in 1853, said that it was \u201ca matter of wonderment\u201d to see \u201cthe over-tired artisan, the worn-out factory girl\u201d rush from work to \u201cthe hot atmosphere of a crowded lecture room.\u201d Even as the country slid toward the Civil War, the lectures continued, rooted in the belief in what Warren called \u201cthe word as a means toward reform.\u201d", "At the same time, America was embarking on a surge of political violence, much of it directed at Black people, immigrants, Native Americans, and abolitionists. Between the eighteen-thirties and the outbreak of war, there were at least thirty-five major riots in the Northeast. One of them began in June, 1857, when three nativist gangs\u2014the Chunkers, the Rip-Raps, and the Plug Uglies\u2014attacked Catholic immigrants in Washington, D.C., as they tried to cast ballots. The U.S. Marines, called in to quell the unrest, ended up responsible for a number of deaths.", "But the most ominous sign for the Republic was the growing brutality among some of the country\u2019s most powerful people: members of Congress. In \u201cThe Field of Blood,\u201d the Yale history professor Joanne B. Freeman examined scores of previously unstudied attacks and melees, often initiated by Southern lawmakers who regarded opposition to slavery as a threat to their property and their power. In the eighteen-forties, Representative John Dawson, of Louisiana, threatened to cut a colleague\u2019s throat \u201cfrom ear to ear,\u201d and was stopped from shooting another only by the intervention of other congressmen. Freeman described a legislature guided by the ethics of professional wrestling: \u201cPunching. Pistols. Bowie knives. Congressmen brawling in bunches while colleagues stood on chairs to get a good look.\u201d The fighting escalated to the point that a Southern lawmaker threatened to lead an assault on the Capitol, and British diplomats came to regard the House floor as too dangerous to visit. Benjamin Brown French, a genial New Englander who served as clerk of the House of Representatives, stopped socializing with Southerners and ultimately took to carrying a pistol.", "When I asked Freeman how violence and the cult of reason could coexist, she said that they sprang from a shared motive: \u201cHow did you prove that you were a leader in that period, to a vast audience? How did you earn support? Maybe through aggressive oratory. Maybe by making, and keeping, promises for your constituents, state, and section of the Union. And, for a time, maybe by displaying your domination of the political playing field with bullying and aggression.\u201d", "Freeman\u2019s history of congressional violence is an account of how some of the most privileged members of a society began to see their counterparts as enemies, and eventually as existential threats. Once political leaders lost trust in each other, the public was doomed to follow. \u201cUnable to turn to the government for resolution, Americans North and South turned on one another,\u201d she wrote.", "In 1844, Samuel F. B. Morse, the pioneer of the telegraph, transmitted his first message: \u201cWhat hath God wrought?\u201d Morse predicted that his invention would unify Americans, making \u201cone neighborhood of the whole country.\u201d Indeed, the telegraph brought benefits beyond measure. But it also tipped politics toward entertainment and fear, lighting a fuse that runs through to the age of @ realDonaldTrump.", "The day after Morse unveiled his device, a newspaper used a telegraph to relay the first squib of news from Washington to Baltimore. By the end of the century, readers were wading through a flood of cheap errata from afar\u2014mostly of war, crime, fires, and floods. Neil Postman, one of the twentieth century\u2019s most prominent scholars of communications, wrote, \u201cThe telegraph may have made the country into \u2018one neighborhood,\u2019 but it was a peculiar one, populated by strangers who knew nothing but the most superficial facts about each other.\u201d", "In \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death,\u201d published in 1985, Postman described how the triumph of television further heightened the entertainment value of politics. He watched the 1984 Presidential debates, between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale, and lamented the hollow dodges, casual deceptions, and abbreviated answers. With a level of alarm that now looks quaint, he bemoaned Reagan\u2019s easy laugh lines and wrote, \u201cThe men were less concerned with giving arguments than with \u2018giving off\u2019 impressions, which is what television does best.\u201d It would be three decades before the host of a reality show entered a bid for the Presidency. But Postman already sensed that \u201cthe demarcation line between what is show business and what is not becomes harder to see with each passing day.\u201d", "Richard Hofstadter, the eminent political scientist, is best known for his work on what he called the \u201carena for uncommonly angry minds,\u201d including anti-intellectualism and \u201cthe paranoid style.\u201d But, in 1970, near the end of his life, Hofstadter became fascinated by the juncture of politics and force. It had swept through American life in recent years, producing assassinations and riots. Working with a co-author, Michael Wallace, who collected two thousand cases of violence\u2014massacres, rebellions, vigilantism\u2014he hoped to address what he called the American paradox: \u201cThere is far more violence in our national heritage than our proud, sometimes smug, national self-image admits of.\u201d", "Sharp turns in politics and economics inspired new forms of bloodletting. After the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan and other vigilantes adopted lynching to prevent freed Black people from working, studying, and voting. In the first scholarly study of lynching, from 1903, the sociologist James E. Cutler described it as a \u201ccriminal practice which is peculiar to the United States.\u201d Later, as workers started to organize and demand protections, violence ignited. In 1914, the National Guard stormed an encampment of workers in the Colorado coalfields, causing a rifle battle and setting tents on fire, killing eleven children and two women. The historians Philip Taft and Philip Ross later wrote, \u201cThe United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation.\u201d", "Hofstadter noted that in America, unlike the rest of the world, political violence rarely involved poor citizens rising up against a powerful state; more often, citizens attacked one another, and, usually, the attackers were established Americans\u2014white Protestants, in many cases\u2014turning on minorities, immigrants, \u201cCatholics, radicals, workers and labor organizers.\u201d Hofstadter made note of \u201cverbal and ideological violence\u201d that laid the foundation for actual harm. He also fretted about a \u201crising mystique of violence on the left.\u201d By 1969, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a civil-rights group co-founded by John Lewis, had elected new leadership and dropped \u201cNonviolent\u201d from its name. The usually staid New York Review of Books had featured an instructional diagram for making a Molotov cocktail. On both the left and the right, Hofstadter sensed, politics was giving way to a culture of self-expression suited to the rise of television, in which the \u201cdistinction between politics and theatre has been deliberately blurred.\u201d Practitioners had figured out that what played well on TV was often the language and the imagery of force.", "Neil Postman liked to explain American history as a sequence of metaphors, which, he wrote, \u201ccreate the content of our culture.\u201d Each era had its own: the Western frontier, Upton Sinclair\u2019s urban slaughterhouse, and eventually the gilded illusions of Las Vegas. Postman died in 2003, but he might have found the central metaphor of contemporary American culture in the era of \u201ctwilight\u201d warfare, which began on September 11, 2001, and extended to Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and at least nine other countries where U.S. troops were dispatched under the banner of fighting terrorism.", "The language of conflict blended with entertainment and bled back into politics. In 2006, Laura Ingraham, the conservative commentator, cited the TV series \u201c24,\u201d which featured frequent depictions of torture. \u201cThe average American out there loves the show \u201824,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIn my mind, that\u2019s as close to a national referendum that it\u2019s O.K. to use tough tactics against high-level Al Qaeda operatives as we\u2019re going to get.\u201d", "At times, the war came home, captured in headlines about a foiled plot or a radicalized \u201chomegrown\u201d terrorist. But, for most Americans, it was an abstraction, fought far away from what was now routinely described as the \u201chomeland.\u201d In the twilight war, Americans had acquired an enemy that felt invisible but ever present, everywhere and nowhere, threatening enough that any measures became permissible. Geography and details became incidental. More than three years into the Iraq War, a National Geographic poll found that fewer than a quarter of Americans with some college education could locate Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Israel on a map.", "The peril of ignorance is a perennial American lament. Less than a generation after the founding of the country, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201cIf a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.\u201d But, by the early years of the twenty-first century, Americans were no longer surprised by annual reports that showed our students falling behind other countries\u2019. In a 2005 survey, two-thirds of Americans could not name the three branches of government. Scarcely a third of high-school seniors read at or above the level of proficiency."], "authors": ["Evan Osnos", "Evan Osno"], "keywords": ["violence", "national", "called", "politics", "americans", "american", "war", "postman", "pulling", "brink", "political", "wrote"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
