Now \u201ccrowdshipping\u201d services are doing the same with parcels, allowing senders to \u201cplug into\u201d road traffic as if it were a utility, says Marc Gorlin, boss of Roadie, a startup based in Atlanta. Drivers get a tip; the middlemen take a cut. Firms like Mr Gorlin\u2019s are proliferating. Rappi operates in 57 cities in Latin America. A Filipino firm, Jojo, does so in Manila, the capital, and a nearby province.", "Many of the senders are companies. Amazon\u2019s quick and cheap deliveries are forcing others to up their game, says Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley, a bank. Corporate fleets and logistics giants like FedEx will dominate long-haul routes. But by tapping into people\u2019s movements, firms can withstand spikes in demand\u2014floral bouquets on Mother\u2019s Day, say\u2014and save money on the \u201clast mile\u201d, often the costliest leg of a parcel\u2019s journey.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Four-fifths of Roadie\u2019s revenue comes from retailers such as Macy\u2019s, Walmart or Home Depot (which has invested in Mr Gorlin\u2019s firm). Airlines are another big client. Nearly half of Delta\u2019s mishandled bags are delivered by travellers who use Roadie\u2019s app to see if suitcases need dropping off along their drive home. The carrier\u2019s head of cargo, Gareth Joyce, says this has cut costs, speeded up deliveries and boosted customer satisfaction. Alaska Airlines, Southwest and United also use Roadie to return lost luggage.", "Other crowdshipping startups are eyeing free space inside travellers\u2019 suitcases.

The transporter buys the item and receives the reimbursement and tip on delivery. The apps discourage transporters from pretending a purchase is for personal use to avoid customs duties.
