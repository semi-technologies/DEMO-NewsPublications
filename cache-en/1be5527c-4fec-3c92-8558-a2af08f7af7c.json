If your quarantine has looked anything like mine, Swift\u2019s productivity\u2014her capacity to create under duress, to dutifully imagine and populate elaborate new worlds\u2014is staggering. \u201cAll I do is try, try, try,\u201d Swift sang on \u201cmirrorball,\u201d a song on \u201cfolklore\u201d about the spirit-depleting requirements of celebrity. \u201cI\u2019m still on that trapeze / I\u2019m still trying everything / To keep you looking at me,\u201d she sighed. Swift is exquisitely focussed, and, by her own admission, keen to please, but I\u2019ve often had a hard time connecting with her more labored or overdetermined singles. On \u201cevermore,\u201d she sounds loose and unburdened\u2014free, finally, from the debilitating squeeze of other people\u2019s expectations. It\u2019s a lush, tender, and beautiful album, steadier if less varied than \u201cfolklore,\u201d and infused with backward-looking wisdom. \u201cAll you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness,\u201d Swift sings on \u201chappiness,\u201d a song about grasping for perspective after a particularly devastating breakup. \u201cYou haven\u2019t met the new me yet / And I think she\u2019ll give you that.\u201d", "For \u201cevermore,\u201d Swift enlisted much of the same crew that made \u201cfolklore\u201d: Aaron Dessner, of the indie-rock band the National; the producer Jack Antonoff; her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn (who writes under the pseudonym William Bowery); and Justin Vernon, of Bon Iver. When Swift first announced that she was collaborating with Dessner for \u201cfolklore,\u201d critics scrambled to parse the ways in which Dessner\u2019s aesthetic\u2014he and his brother Bryce (who also worked on \u201cevermore\u201d) are known for harmonically sophisticated arrangements, and for quickly establishing a deep, spectral tension in their music\u2014might affect Swift\u2019s approach to melody and phrasing. This time, it\u2019s more interesting to think about the ways in which Swift has tempered or sweetened Dessner\u2019s style. The country-tinged \u201cno body, no crime,\u201d which features HAIM, is an oversized homicidal revenge fantasy in the spirit of the Chicks\u2019 \u201cGoodbye, Earl\u201d or Carrie Underwood\u2019s \u201cBefore He Cheats.\u201d It\u2019s more buoyant, playful, and patently user-friendly than anything Dessner has been involved with before.", "This is also true of Swift\u2019s duet with Vernon, who sings on the album\u2019s title track. Vernon\u2019s most dynamic and emotionally rich music is often formally inscrutable, yet \u201cexile,\u201d Swift\u2019s first duet with Vernon, from \u201cfolklore,\u201d is more rooted in Broadway than the avant-garde. In recent years, the old hierarchies\u2014in which pop music was thought of as frivolous and inherently inferior to more \u201ccerebral\u201d (and generally male) genres\u2014have mostly collapsed, and there is real pleasure in witnessing a grip-loosening within the independent music scene. I used to cringe every time Swift started to talk in the middle of a song, because it felt too corny or overtly theatrical. (\u201cHey, kids! Spelling is fun!\u201d nearly killed me, and apparently her too.) Chalk it up to the great psychic disintegration of 2020, but this time around, when Danielle Haim pipes up, \u201cShe was with me, dude,\u201d in the final verse of \u201cno body, no crime,\u201d I simply grinned.", "On \u201cfolklore,\u201d Swift started experimenting with different characters and points of view, a move that was quickly framed as a departure from the more confessional, first-person emoting that defined her earlier work. This is a funny way to think about writing\u2014every consciousness developed on the page is, inevitably, an invention of sorts, honed and sharpened and shaped to fit a particular narrative\u2014but, as a vocalist, Swift is wonderfully adept at inhabiting other characters, and finds a way to bring real empathy to their experiences. Two of my favorite tracks on \u201cevermore,\u201d \u201c\u2019tis the damn season\u201d and \u201cdorothea,\u201d feature a pair of young lovers ultimately undone by time, circumstance, and incompatible desires. One left home, taking off for Hollywood as soon as they could, while the other stayed put in Tupelo. (\u201cOoh, this place is the same as it ever was / Ooh, but you don\u2019t like it that way.\u201d) Swift has long subscribed to the notion that certain types of communion are inevitable, immortal, inescapable. A true, once-in-a-lifetime love never diminishes; it merely changes shape over time. \u201cThere\u2019s an ache in you, put there by the ache in me,\u201d she sings. The lovers share an endless, circular pain: there\u2019s no way to be together, but they can\u2019t extinguish the yearning, either.", "While \u201cevermore\u201d feels like a significant step in Swift\u2019s creative evolution, it still features plenty of her signature moves. Swift has always indulged in a bit of an underdog complex, beginning with \u201cYou Belong with Me,\u201d from \u201cFearless,\u201d her second album. \u201cShe wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts / She\u2019s cheer captain and I\u2019m on the bleachers,\u201d Swift opined, often while in heels and red lipstick, her blond hair looking extra shiny. (She plays both roles\u2014the regular girl and the vixen\u2014in the video.) On \u201cwillow,\u201d she again alludes to feeling undervalued: \u201cThey count me out time and time again / Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind / But I come back stronger than a nineties trend.\u201d", "It\u2019s sometimes hard to square Swift\u2019s eternally wounded self-conception with her almost unimaginable success. She is the best-selling artist of 2020, and has sold more than two hundred million albums during an era in which sales of that magnitude are increasingly rare. Perhaps money and fame don\u2019t actually make life any simpler, but it would nonetheless be refreshing to see Swift express confidence\u2014she has certainly earned it\u2014without framing it as a miraculous resurrection, or pointing to some unnamed tormentor (usually presumed to be an ex-boyfriend, or, more recently, either Kanye West or Scooter Braun). Her album \u201cReputation,\u201d from 2017, perhaps suffered the most from this sort of incongruous dark-horse positioning.", "Swift\u2019s tendency to espouse irrational insecurity can feel human, maybe even kind, but I also think she has better and more interesting ways of connecting with her listeners. The track \u201cgold rush,\u201d which was co-written and co-produced by Swift and Antonoff, seems as if it might be a sequel to \u201cGorgeous,\u201d a song from \u201cReputation\u201d in which Swift grows increasingly livid at her own incapacitation in the face of beauty:", "You\u2019re so gorgeous", "I can\u2019t say anything to your face", "\u2019Cause look at your face", "And I\u2019m so furious", "At you for making me feel this way", "On \u201cgold rush,\u201d she continues to frame beauty as a nefarious force: it\u2019s terrifying, she suggests, to become enraptured or held in thrall. \u201cWhat must it be like to grow up that beautiful?\u201d she wonders. For Swift, the worst part is that everyone else can see it, too: \u201cEverybody wants you / Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you,\u201d she sings. Swift is at her best when she\u2019s frank about how much it hurts to be vulnerable. \u201cI don\u2019t like that fallin\u2019 feels like flyin\u2019 \u2019til the bone crush,\u201d she admits, her voice tense, almost angry. Though the song features ample instrumentation (horns, strings, organs, Mellotron), Antonoff\u2019s production is dutiful and restrained, comparable to the kind of caution a person might bring to a new relationship if they\u2019d been hurt before.", "No matter what she\u2019s singing about, Swift always manages to position herself as a confidante of sorts, and \u201cevermore\u201d is good company for what\u2019s shaping up to be one of the more arduous winters in American history. The album\u2019s primary aims are intimacy and comfort, and it has arrived during a season in which we are all especially starved for companionship and peace. \u201cI felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning,\u201d Swift wrote of the album\u2019s creation. It\u2019s likely that \u201cevermore\u201d will feel that way for her fans, too\u2014a kind of homecoming, even if we can\u2019t actually go home.", "2020 in Review"], "authors": ["Amanda Petrusich", "Amanda Petrusic"], "keywords": ["albums", "intimacy", "taylor", "comfort", "folklore", "swift", "song", "im", "sings", "evermore", "swifts", "way", "think"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
