Some are stubby. Others are impossibly thin wine goblets, marketed as having a \u201cfeminine body curve\u201d. But it is another curve\u2014the steep upward one that Deli\u2019s mastery of the business has traced\u2014that ought to command more attention. Founded in 1996, the company initially churned out cheap, easily chipped glasses. Little by little it has raised its game, nearly tripling its exports over the past decade. It once had no choice but to import equipment for crafting its finest glassware. Now it can use China-made machinery. \u201cApart from branding, there\u2019s not much that separates us from the world\u2019s best,\u201d says Cheng Yingling, a senior executive.", "Deli\u2019s evolution\u2014which has involved getting better and more Chinese at the same time\u2014is what the government wants for the broader economy. These are not exactly novel ideas. For years officials have declared that China must grow more innovative and more resilient. To a certain extent it has achieved this naturally, as a result of its fast-paced economic development. But these goals have taken on far greater urgency as tensions with America have mounted. American restrictions on exports of critical components, notably semiconductors, have shone a harsh light on the gaps in China\u2019s industrial abilities. Drinking glasses may be much simpler to make\u2014requiring not much more than sand and sodium carbonate plus some relatively basic machinery\u2014but China is not about to stop there. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, has described the creation of fully domestic supply chains as a matter of national security.", "The question is how to build them. Chinese officials know that they cannot turn their backs on the world. Exports are still an important source of revenue for many firms such as Deli. And China must attract technology and investment from abroad. Pushing too transparently for \u201cindigenous innovation\u201d, a term once bandied about by the government, only makes foreigners wary. Striking the right balance is tough.", "Enter the newest of China\u2019s big economic policies: the \u201cdual-circulation\u201d strategy. At its most basic it refers to keeping China open to the world (the \u201cgreat international circulation\u201d), while reinforcing its own market (the \u201cgreat domestic circulation\u201d). If that sounds rather vague, it is: the government has not spelled out the details. Nevertheless, it has fast emerged as the most talked-about economic policy in China, with analysts and businesspeople jostling to put their spin on it. The strategy lies at the heart of the five-year plan for 2021-25, an outline of which was released by the Communist Party on November 3rd. Its implementation\u2014especially how China resolves the tension between the two kinds of circulation\u2014will be critical to the way that China\u2019s economy develops.", "The term \u201cinternational circulation\u201d was coined in 1988 by Wang Jian, a government researcher who argued that China should pursue an export-led growth strategy, plugging its vast pool of cheap labour into global production networks. Well into the early 2000s, this was a guiding principle for China\u2019s economic planners. Yet circumstances have changed. Exports have shrunk as a share of GDP \u2014from 36% in 2006 to 18% last year. The government has repeatedly vowed to make consumption within China a bigger engine of growth. So scholars have been turning their attention more to the domestic kind of circulation.", "In May it became evident that this academic debate had reached official ears. At a meeting of the Politburo, Mr Xi described dual circulation as the framework for economic policy. Initially, jaded veterans of Chinese official rhetoric were tempted to dismiss this as just another way of phrasing the long-stated goal of rebalancing towards domestic demand. But it has become clear that something bigger is afoot. More recent comments by Mr Xi on the economy have been less about promoting consumption and more about bolstering China\u2019s defences. China needs \u201cself-developed, controllable\u201d supply chains, with at least one alternative source for vital products, he said in a speech published on October 31st. Even more striking was his inversion of the idea of international circulation. Instead of talking about it in terms of the economic benefits China reaps from globalisation, he emphasised only the strategic purpose of opening China\u2019s doors to foreign firms, ie that making them more dependent on the Chinese market would deter foreign powers from putting pressure on the country.", "That combination\u2014the pursuit both of economic self-reliance and of greater economic leverage over foreign countries\u2014now describes much of what China is doing. Mr Xi refers to changes \u201cunseen in a hundred years\u201d sweeping the global order\u2014a way of saying that, while China is rising, America is declining and trying to stop the new power (see Chaguan). \u201cWhere linkages with the global economy create vulnerabilities, China wants to minimise them,\u201d says Andrew Polk of Trivium China, a research firm. \u201cWhere the linkages create benefits, China wants to expand them.\u201d", "Chinese officials tailor their remarks on dual circulation to please foreign ears. In a video address on November 4th at the opening of the China International Import Expo, an annual jamboree in Shanghai, Mr Xi said the concept would involve opening China more widely to the rest of the world. \u201cThis is not just what China needs for its development, but something that will enrich the people of all countries,\u201d he said. But businesses in China see the concept more as an indication that the government will step up support for favoured industries at home, says Zhu Ning of the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. They are hungry for news of handouts.", "In its outline of the new five-year plan (a fleshed-out final version will be adopted next year at the annual session of China\u2019s parliament, probably in March), the party did not specify industries to be coddled. Instead it referred more generally to a need to develop critical technologies at home. But other policies already in train suggest that China will prop up any high-tech sector threatened by global vicissitudes. In August it announced tax breaks and loan support for semiconductor and software firms. China currently produces about 30% of the chips it consumes (see chart 1). Its goal is to reach 70% by 2025. Another focus is on green technology and renewable energy. That is not just for the sake of the environment (China recently pledged to halt the rise of its carbon emissions by 2030). Investment in such businesses will also limit China\u2019s thirst for imported oil. In the past, when publishing outlines of five-year plans prior to their adoption by parliament, the party has often announced a goal for average annual GDP growth during the plan period (see chart 2). There was no such figure this time. In separate comments, Mr Xi said it was entirely possible that China could double the size of its economy by 2035. That would require average annual growth of 4.7% over the next 15 years. Such a rate would be readily attainable for the first half of that period, but may become much harder thereafter."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["international", "foreigners", "mr", "china", "circling", "economic", "global", "dualcirculation", "relying", "means", "circulation", "xi", "growth", "chinas", "strategy", "economy"], "pubDate": "2020-11-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
