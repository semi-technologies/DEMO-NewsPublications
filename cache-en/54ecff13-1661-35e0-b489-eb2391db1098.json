Following the news that stock has seen an noticeable decrease since the perceived 'failed' last-gen launch of the game, a conference call at CD Projekt RED has gone public revealing no plans in place to actually deliver the promised refunds, and how the oversight happened with such a dramatic decrease in performance on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 systems, despite numerous promises to the contrary.", "The call begins with joint-CEO of CDPR, Adam Kicinski, talking about the post-launch decline of the game's standing with consumers. Joined by Piotr Neilubowicz, the studio's CFRO, co-founder Marcin Iwinski, and board member Michal Nowakowski, the conference call covered an array of topics, including how there is no actual plan in place to deliver the promised refunds that the studio offered on Monday.", "Regaridng how \"it is even possible that it has come to this\" regarding fan perception, the call opened up by saying:", "After 3 delays, we as the Management Board were too focused on releasing the game. We underestimated the scale and complexity of the issues, we ignored the signals about the need for additional time to refine the game on the base last-gen consoles. It was the wrong approach and against our business philosophy. On top of that, during the campaign, we showed the game mostly on PCs.", "This caused the loss of gamers\u2019 trust and the reputation that we\u2019ve been building through a big part of our lives. That\u2019s why our first steps are solely focused on regaining those two things. We are concentrated on fixing Cyberpunk on last-gen consoles. The first substantial set of fixes was released over the weekend. The next set of fixes will be released within the next seven days. Big updates are planned for January and February, together with smaller fixes. Of course, PC gamers will also be getting regular updates and fixes to improve the game. We will do everything possible to prove that we stick to our values.", "Investors on the call were then able to ask questions, asking what happened to make sales decrease so much in a span of just four days, especially so for last-gen consoles. Nielubowwicz said that despite doing \"good initial sales,\" the fact that last-gen versions were seemingly left in the dust caused that dramatic pivot. Nowakowski added that \"throwing more [developers] at it\" would not have made the quality of the last-gen version any better, and the the team is still \"collecting data\" regarding all of the reasons behind the decline.", "On Monday, the team apologized for the lack of transparency, a transparency missing when the studio seemingly hid the true nature of what the game runs like on last-gen and its restrictive nature of the game's review embargo, and offered refunds. The problem with that is that those that tried to take the company's offer up on refunds, they were running into declines from Xbox and PlayStation, saying that digital buyers should just \"wait until January and February\" for the promised fixes.", "The CFO then added, \"One has to understand: Microsoft and Sony have refund policies for every product that is released digitally on their storefronts. Despite several articles I\u2019ve seen that things are being set up just for us, it\u2019s actually not true \u2013 these policies are in place and have always been in place; they\u2019re not offered specifically for us. Anyone who has purchased any title on the PlayStation network or the Microsoft storefront can ask for a refund, and if it\u2019s made within certain boundaries, usually related to time, usage and so on, can ask for that refund. Our procedure here with Microsoft and Sony is not different than with any other title released on any of those storefronts. I want to state that clearly, as there seem to be certain misconceptions. In terms of financial participation, when our product is refunded, the share from the store that Microsoft took is refunded, and of course it\u2019s something that is subtracted from the share of revenues that would normally be transmitted to CD PROJEKT. It\u2019s, of course, not shared with us and is instead refunded to the given player \u2013 the given customer. I think that pretty much sums up the first one.\"", "The answer to why that disconnect is happening is simple: CDPR didn't actually clear their plan of action with either Xbox nor PlayStation, therefore a promise was made that wasn't entirely theirs to make. \"We are not encouraging gamers to return the game; we hope they\u2019ll give us a chance to improve it on old-gen consoles,\" said Iwinski. \"One fix was released last weekend; another one is coming in seven days \u2013 but there is an option, obviously, and the easiest way is to ask the retailer for a refund. If that\u2019s not possible, we also provide help. As of today it\u2019s too early to say; we\u2019ve just begun the process and we sincerely hope that gamers will prefer to wait for updates since they had waited so long for the game, but \u2013 again \u2013 this is our humble hope. We\u2019ll assess the situation in a couple of days when we have the numbers.\"", "Regarding external testing to ensure that the last-gen system versions were functional, the main reason behind the request for refunds, Kininski replied: \"We have an internal QA department and we\u2019re working with external companies as well. One thing that perhaps didn\u2019t help us is COVID: internal testers are able to test the game working from home because we provide them with our own connected machines and so on, but external testers working for external companies were not able to test the game from homes \u2013 they have test centers and if they\u2019re not there, they\u2019re not able to work. So, we have seen a decrease in the number of testers, but I wouldn\u2019t point to it as a major source of problems. The third one, about multiplayer \u2013 first and foremost, we haven\u2019t confirmed any dates yet, and as I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s hard to judge now. We\u2019re in an unanticipated situation and we\u2019ll have to reassess. This is planned for January. We\u2019re now focusing on managing the single-player release, working on patches, communication and \u2013 as I said at the very beginning of this call \u2013 our focus remains on gamers.\"", "The biggest question during this call was how it could have been this bad with last-gen versions of the game. How did this go unnoticed, how did the team think they could hide it from the public, and just what could have been done to prevent this.", "Nowakowski mentioned, \"It is more about us looking \u2013 as was previously stated \u2013 at the PC and next-gen performance rather than current-gen. We definitely did not spend enough time looking at that. I wouldn\u2019t say that we felt any external or internal pressure to launch on the date \u2013 other than the normal pressure, which is typical for any release. So that was not the cause. In terms of the certification process and the third parties \u2013 this is definitely on our side. I can only assume that they trusted that we\u2019re going to fix things upon release, and that obviously did not come together exactly as we had planned. Regarding the third question \u2013 where we want to go with the PlayStation and Xbox \u2013 as stated in the statement made public today in the morning, we are planning to get the game in much better shape than it is now, of course, and a lot of that is going to be happening in December. Come January and February you\u2019re going to see larger improvements \u2013 which we\u2019ve stated already. We have also stated that if your expectation is that the game is going to be equal to, say, nextgens or PC in terms of performance, that definitely isn\u2019t going to happen. Having said that, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to be a bad game \u2013 but if you\u2019re expectations regarding, say, visuals or other performance angle, are like this, then we\u2019re openly stating that\u2019s not going to be the case. It will be a good, playable, stable game, without glitches and crashes, though. That\u2019s the intention.\"", "While no one expected new-gen performance on last-gen systems, many have reported that the game is near unplayable due to corrupted saves, wild bugs, and \"PS3-like\" graphics. A part of the shock about the latter part is that, during the call, Iwinksi admits that while they did show console footage, the footage seen was never true last-gen gameplay. The reason offered was that they were \"still updating the game until the very last minute,\" which is also the reason offered as to why they were blocking console codes from reviewers.", "The call also confirmed that no major update for last-gen systems will be seen in time for the holidays, as to give the team a much-needed break (re: in relation to the conversation about crunch surrounding the studio's culture), but that Janurary and February will see immense change.", "While true this-gen version of the game are on the horizon, Iwinski says that those versions \"just aren't ready yet\" but that the team will let investors and consumers know as soon as they are.", "To read the full transcript, you can learn more right here (via Nibel)."], "authors": ["Associate Editor", "With An Arguably Unhealthy Obsession With Dragon Age", "Mass Effect", "Liana Is Wildly Passionate About All Things In The Gaming Community.
