The 33-year-old designer\u2019s vibrant footwear has become ubiquitous in celebrity circles, where stars like Kim Kardashian West, Bella Hadid, and Irina Shayk seek out her square-toe sandals, vampy boots, and newly launched mini bags. The kind of high-impact accessories that make a splash on social media, Muaddi\u2019s shoes (and the designer herself) have had an outsize impact on 2020. After picking up the FN Achievement Award this week alongside Rihanna and Jahleel Weaver for her collaboration with Fenty, Muaddi\u2019s effect on the industry as a whole is unquestionable.", "Growing up, the path from editorial-obsessed teenager to designer wasn\u2019t always straightforward. \u201cBy the time I was nine, I was determined to work in the fashion industry,\u201d Muaddi explains. \u201cI was constantly reading magazines and asking my mom how I could get a job in fashion. Obviously, she had no idea. We were living in Jordan and then Romania, and it wasn\u2019t the most open environment. Still, my interests began there.\u201d", "Eventually, Muaddi would move to Italy, where she would enroll in the European Institute of Design in Milan. Before founding her eponymous line, Muaddi worked as a stylist, perfecting looks in the pages of L\u2019Uomo Vogue and GQ. But her love of footwear\u2014everything from sneakers to the highest of heels can be found in her expansive wardrobe\u2014pushed her toward starting a business, one she approached with characteristic zeal. \u201cI love what I do, so it doesn\u2019t feel like a job,\u201d she says. \u201cFashion is my life, and it takes all my time.\u201d", "Muaddi spends the bulk of her days creating collections, but she\u2019s more than a workaholic. A travel enthusiast who before the global lockdown enjoyed a nomadic existence where trips to fashion capitals like London, New York, and Milan were routine, she seeks inspiration everywhere she goes. \u201cI love to experience new places and cultures\u2014every experience is meaningful. I can be inspired by photography, art, or people near me. Anything that captures my eye and provokes an emotion,\u201d says Muaddi. \u201cIt\u2019s instinctual when you see something that makes you stop and wonder.\u201d", "Those varied influences reflect Muaddi\u2019s eclectic sense of style and the cosmopolitan sensibility she brings to her designs. Who else would make a clear bejeweled pump worthy of Cinderella or cover a slingback in ombr\u00e9 lam\u00e9? Muaddi\u2019s shoes are conversation starters and their flair has made her a fixture on Instagram, where fans follow her expertly styled outfits and regularly upload snapshots of their purchases. For Muaddi, the direct line of communication has been heartening, particularly during 2020\u2019s quarantine. \u201cFrom the beginning, I\u2019ve had this genuine relationship with our customers,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if they\u2019re complaining and they write to me, I appreciate it because the love, the feedback, and the critiques are very direct.\u201d Still, the most exciting part has been seeing how her creations have brought joy during a challenging year. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool to see them get excited and happy unboxing their shoes,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s great seeing which ones they get and sharing those moments. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod", "Rachel Besse"], "keywords": ["wasnt", "fashion", "masters", "job", "style", "designer", "amina", "line", "footwear", "shoes", "hollywoods", "favorite", "eclectic", "muaddis", "love", "seeing", "milan", "muaddi"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
