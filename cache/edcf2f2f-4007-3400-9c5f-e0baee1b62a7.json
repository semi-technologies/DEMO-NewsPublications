The wooden replica is part of Remembrance Day celebrations in the West Midlands village. The event has been a hotly anticipated annual spectacle since 2015, when an ambitious display featuring 1,500 knitted poppies hit the headlines. \u201cWe are becoming a Poppy Village,\u201d says Garry Perry, a councillor. Preparations for November 11th take up much of his year.", "Remembrance Day was not always as extravagant as this. In the years after the first world war, Britons were split on how best to remember the fallen. Some wanted solemn parades; others alcohol-fuelled parties. Restraint won the day. Poppies\u2014a reference to those that grew on the battlefields\u2014were worn, a two-minute silence was observed and veterans marched. It seemed likely that, once all the survivors of the Great War were dead, the ceremonies would wither away.", "The opposite has happened. Inspired by the Tower of London\u2019s 2014 installation of 888,246 ceramic poppies marking the war\u2019s centenary\u2014each bloom representing a casualty from Britain and its colonies\u2014towns are now creating ever more ostentatious displays. Giant roadside poppies painted on grass verges are popular, as are road markings. In Bolton, Greater Manchester, 12 poppies have been painted onto strategic thoroughfares.", "Poppy cascades are also in vogue. In Callington, Cornwall, 9,000 knitted poppies float down a church wall. After dark in Melksham, Wiltshire, an animation of a poppy fading into love hearts plays continually on the town hall\u2019s facade. Not even covid-19 is allowed to interrupt remembrance ceremonies: the government has let socially distanced parades go ahead.", "This iconography helps fill the void left by veterans, whose stoic marching in regimental ties once provided a meditative imagery on its own. \u201cCreativity comes forward in the space of living advocates of the events, to try to find other ways to prompt people into thinking and reflecting,\u201d says Alexander Ehmann, a councillor in Richmond, London, who turned a zebra crossing into a multi-colour poppy design.", "The boom in remembrance artistry has coincided with a resurgence of patriotism. \u201cThere was a period in this country where you were afraid to show your nationalism,\u201d says Mr Perry. \u201cVillages like mine\u2026want to be able to keep the traditions that they\u2019re proud of.\u201d Andy Morgan, a Bolton councillor and veteran, thinks enthusiasm for the armed forces has grown, too. \u201cIt\u2019s much more respectful, almost like it is in America now.\u201d He believes that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, which provided a fresh supply of veterans for Bolton\u2019s parades, burnished that admiration."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["veterans", "day", "councillor", "poppy", "wars", "parades", "war", "village", "competitive", "remembrance", "poppies", "celebrations"], "pubDate": "2020-11-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
