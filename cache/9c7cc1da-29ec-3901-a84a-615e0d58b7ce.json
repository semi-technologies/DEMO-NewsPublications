Today Galicia stands out for two other reasons. The first is that since democracy arrived four decades ago, it has progressed from being one of the poorest regions of Spain to enjoying an income only slightly below the national average. Its second peculiarity is that like Catalonia or the Basque Country it is a cultural nation but, unlike them, it is one that is comfortable in Spain. Separatism is the pursuit of a fairly small minority.", "Its economic success is broad-based. Apart from Europe\u2019s largest fishing industry, shipbuilding, dairying and timber, Galicia has two industrial mainstays: Inditex, based near A Coru\u00f1a, has grown into the world\u2019s biggest provider of fast fashion through Zara and its other chains. A vast Citro\u00ebn plant near Vigo anchors 30,000 car-industry jobs. The regional government has invested European funds in motorways: it is still six hours to Madrid, but it used to take twice as long. A high-speed railway link should be completed by 2022.", "There are other factors behind Galicia\u2019s success. A tradition of dividing farms among all children led to rural poverty (and emigration) but also to a culture that values private property, the leira (homestead) and hard work. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the president of the regional government since 2009, highlights Galicia\u2019s political stability. Mr Feij\u00f3o is from the conservative People\u2019s Party, which at national level has become increasingly centralist. In Galicia it has adopted a strong regional identity that Mr Feij\u00f3o calls Galleguismo. \u201cWe have defended Galicia as a place that has its own language, culture, heritage and special characteristics,\u201d he says. This has \u201chalted nationalism\u201d. At an election in July, Mr Feij\u00f3o retained his absolute majority of seats in the Galician parliament, another rarity for Spain.", "Critics complain that he has failed to halt an exodus of talent, as young professionals seek opportunities abroad. In fact, Galicia has seen more immigrants than emigrants in this century. But it is an ageing society. The dynamism of the coast contrasts with a depopulated interior, prone to forest fires. The covid-19 pandemic, although mild in the region, may expose flaws in the Galician formula (with cases rising, on October 30th Mr Feij\u00f3o restricted movement into and out of the main towns). \u201cThe economic model gave priority to cement over knowledge,\u201d says Xos\u00e9 Manoel N\u00fa\u00f1ez Seixas, a historian at the University of Santiago de Compostela.", "Galicia suffers the vices as well as the virtues of Spanish devolution. It has three airports, where one would do; Gallegos cross the border to Porto in Portugal for many international flights. Politics features localism. Abel Caballero, the mayor of Vigo since 2007, has made a successful political career out of battling Mr Feij\u00f3o. He wants the high-speed train to go straight to his city, rather than via Santiago. That would cost \u20ac2bn to save just 15 minutes, says Mr Feij\u00f3o.", "A nationalist party came second in the election. Its leader, Ana Pont\u00f3n, wants Galicia \u201cto take our own decisions\u201d on energy, infrastructure and taxes and \u201cthe right to decide\u201d on independence. She also wants 50% of teaching to be in Gallego. But most Gallegos seem happy enough with what Mr Feij\u00f3o calls \u201ccordial bilingualism\u201d rather than the language war of Catalonia. The nationalist vote seems to have a ceiling of about 25%. \u201cThe Gallego has ambitions to lead Spain,\u201d says Miguel Conde-Lobato, an advertising man in A Coru\u00f1a. \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in captaining the ship than capsizing it.\u201d \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["mr", "galicia", "success", "gallegos", "devolution", "santiago", "vast", "wants", "work", "spain", "vigo", "regional", "shows", "feij\u00f3o"], "pubDate": "2020-11-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
