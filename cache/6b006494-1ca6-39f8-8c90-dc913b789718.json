At times, it reminds me of what seems to be our own mangled society\u2014with its plotlines about mounting health care bills and border patrols\u2014only more perverse, dangerous, and robotic. It ran on MTV\u2019s experimental Liquid Television from 1991 till 1995. At the time, the show\u2014which was cutting edge, bizarrely sexy, and certainly not for daytime television\u2014played at 10 p.m. with a rerun at midnight.", "The story followed Aeon, an assassin of the fictional world of Monica, who kills targets and retrieves valuable items and whose main focus is to thwart the plan of Trevor Goodchild, an authoritarian ruler in the neighboring city of Bregna. (He\u2019s also her occasional lover.) Aeon is visually arresting and severely angular, equipped with viscously sharp cheekbones and an impossibly whittled waist. She moves quickly, with each sinewy muscle showing, and is flexible with catlike movements and otherworldly parkour abilities.", "It\u2019s always had a cult following\u2014internet forums were buzzing about it in the \u201990s\u2014and now you\u2019ve probably seen splices of the animation pop up on Instagram. The most famous clip is of long tongues interlocking and a fly getting struggling in Aeon\u2019s eyelashes. Most recently Bella Hadid wore a vintage shirt with the image of Aeon on it.", "It makes sense that Aeon\u2019s outfit is still popping up on social media and beyond, albeit randomly: While the series is set in a ransacked, dystopian universe, the clothing seems very modern. It\u2019s also not completely far from what Hadid herself is wearing these days. Aeon\u2019s signature is typically a long-sleeve crop top in a dark shade of purple. (In it, her chest defies gravity and is always, well, pointing straight ahead with a purpose, just like Aeon herself.) Some details about her look are vaguely dominatrix-y, like an O-ring affixed to the middle section of her signature crop top, and she wears hiked-up thong underwear and shin-length boots that look so tight they could be peeled off. We\u2019ve seen nods to this style on recent runways too, including Versace, Junya Watanabe, and Saint Laurent."], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["aeons", "set", "world", "hadid", "beauty", "seen", "flux", "aeon", "90s", "signature", "revisiting", "animated", "dystopian", "look", "series"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
