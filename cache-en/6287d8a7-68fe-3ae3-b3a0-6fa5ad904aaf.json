Leo Abse (pronounced Ab-zee) had been working the tea rooms of the House of Commons all day, charming and cajoling his fellow MP s in his rococo tones\u2014a little flattery here, a white lie there. Now he slipped into the chamber, turning heads as always in spite of his short frame. Settling in his usual perch on the Labour government\u2019s benches, his mischievous eyes darted about the place, searching out both his \u201cstout fellows\u201d and his foes. If his bill were ever to get through, tonight was surely the night.", "The House had already been sitting for 12 hours. It had found time to note the teacher shortage in Scotland, the need for better provision for heroin addicts and the lack of geriatric hospital beds in the Hull area. It had mused on the sorry state of the river whose waters sploshed against the Palace of Westminster. The lack of moorings and amenities on \u201cOld Father Thames\u201d was a disgrace. At last Big Ben, that parliamentary alarm clock, struck ten, and it was Abse\u2019s turn.", "His bill, printed on the green pages each MP clutched, was plain enough: that, in England and Wales, \u201ca homosexual act in private shall not be an offence provided that the parties consent thereto and have attained the age of twenty-one years\u201d. Beside him on those green-leather benches sat his staunch supporters, a new generation of youngish, whipsmart Labour MP s more familiar with cloisters than coal mines. There was Dick Taverne, a 38-year-old barrister, and Shirley Williams, a passionate liberal who had run the Fabian Society, a leftish think-tank. And Roy Jenkins, home secretary and fellow Welshman, who cherished the idea of Britain as a \u201ccivilised society\u201d.", "The benches opposite were sparser, but their occupants no less determined. There was Ray Mawby, a moralising drinker not yet unmasked as a communist spy, Harold Gurden, a dairyman before his election 12 years earlier, and Ian Percival, who promised\u2014or threatened\u2014\u201cto speak through the night if necessary\u201d. To them, gay sex remained \u201cthe abominable crime\u201d; legalising it after 434 years would be yet more damning evidence that England was becoming not a civilised society but a permissive one. They intended to propose amendment after amendment, and to greet each in turn with another lengthy, digressive speech. All they had to do was keep talking.", "To make any progress, the proposers had to call a \u201cclosure motion\u201d\u2014a proposal to curtail discussion and move to a vote\u2014on each amendment. But Parliament\u2019s rule book dictates that such motions can pass only if they are supported by at least 100 MP s. So Abse had to keep enough of his supporters in the chamber not just for the final vote but to see off each amendment in turn. As the night wore on, his enemy was not so much those on the opposite benches as sleep: \u201cIt only needed one or two people to go home...to say \u2018To hell with this, I can\u2019t stay until the dawn,\u2019 and we were undone.\u201d", "It would hardly have been the first defeat. Craning over from the Commons gallery to get a better view of the chamber below were a band of men well used to having their hopes dashed. They were no strangers to Parliament. They had awaited eagerly its debate in 1958 on the Wolfenden Report, an official review that recommended nixing the ban on gay sex that had held since the Buggery Act of 1533. Nothing came of that. Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, told colleagues that loosening the law would lose their party 6m votes.", "You can live your life lonely", "Few men were successfully prosecuted for sex in private, but the threat ensured that blackmail flourished and the closet door remained firmly closed. Some formed loveless marriages; others sought medical help. As Abse worked on his bill, John Wells, a 27-year-old phonetician at University College London, began attending weekly psychotherapy sessions to deal with the \u201cproblem\u201d of his homosexuality. The year before he had split up with his first boyfriend, who\u2014under pressure from his family\u2014had then married a woman.", "Into this vacuum came the House of Lords, Parliament\u2019s unelected second chamber. Stuffed with crusty aristocrats who had inherited their fathers\u2019 titles (and voting rights), it was an unlikely crucible of social reform. Yet, virtually irremovable as they were, there was little to stop their lordships speaking their minds. The eighth Earl of Arran (\u201cBoofy\u201d to his chums) had persuaded his fellow peers to vote for reform in 1965. He never told them his likeliest motivation. His older brother, whom he succeeded to the earldom, took his own life at the age of 55. Years later, Abse met a man who claimed to have been the seventh earl\u2019s lover. In public, Lord Arran\u2019s rationale was more pragmatic, and characteristically Wodehousian. \u201cIt simply needed someone to grasp the nettle. And a damned prickly nettle it was, too.\u201d", "Most MP s still feared its sting. The Lords provided momentum, but support in the Commons was necessary for a bill to become law. No government would risk backing such a contentious measure, so it could reach the statute book only via a private member\u2019s bill, a mechanism that allows MP s to put forward their own laws. Such bills rarely pass, since little time is allotted to them. By 1967, Abse and Humphry Berkley, a Tory parliamentarian, had already proposed some measure of liberalisation three times without success.", "One more try", "Still, this time might be different. After all, Abse had friends in high places. Jenkins was one of a new breed of Labour MP who wanted the party to marry bread-and-butter leftism with social liberalism. As one wag had it, Labour should be the party of \u201cfull enjoyment\u201d as well as full employment. Each time Abse\u2019s bill was frustrated, Jenkins persuaded the government to lend it some of its own time in the Commons, albeit sometimes at ungodly hours. Which is why the gas lamps outside the Palace of Westminster were burning, casting shadows along its Gothic fa\u00e7ade, as, inside, the Speaker finally called the House to order that night.", "Big Ben was about to sound the next hour by the time Abse got to his feet for the first time. His opponents had already made the running for three-quarters of an hour and he was anxious to get on. \u201cIf I am brief in speaking to this amendment,\u201d he began, \u201cI am sure that it will be appreciated that it is out of no discourtesy to the House but because we are dealing with a matter which has been well canvassed.\u201d Abse was not normally so ready to pass up a chance to expound. The limelight was, if anything, a little dark for his liking. He embraced the old Commons tradition of dressing up for Budget day. Out came the top hat and cane, a fresh bloom in his buttonhole. The rest of the year, he favoured a dark green jacket over a mustard waistcoat and maroon trousers. He would stick one thumb in his waistcoat pocket during his lengthy and ornate speeches, enveloping the House in his lyrical, somehow religious, embrace. The Welsh have a pretty word for such oratorical magnetism: hwyl. Abse had bags of the stuff. His interests, too, were colourful, stretching far beyond Pontypool, the mining town in south Wales that he had represented since 1958. He was a successful criminal solicitor, relishing representing suspected murderers, and a keen amateur psychoanalyst, emulating his hero Sigmund Freud. He would go on to publish a slew of eccentric \u201cpsycho-biographies\u201d, attributing John Maynard Keynes\u2019s \u201cbold economic theorising\u201d to his affairs with men, and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s steely resolve to the \u201cdeprivation she felt at [her mother\u2019s] breast\u201d. The title of one of his later books indicated the range of his interests: \u201cFellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love\u201d. Given the need to overcome opposition from sober-suited moralisers, Jenkins was understandably wary of Abse\u2019s involvement: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly the person I would have chosen to be the sponsor of the bill.\u201d Yet it proved a profitable partnership. Jenkins squared the cabinet and spoke publicly in favour of the bill, all the time claiming that the government remained neutral. Meanwhile, Abse put his self-avowed guile to work, enlisting his allies and circumventing his opponents.", "He contrived an argument with himself over whether to exclude the merchant navy from the bill, whipping up the issue in the press. As he hoped, his opponents seized on this. So confident were they that it would take up the first few hours of the bill\u2019s consideration by a parliamentary committee that they did not plan to turn up and table their own amendments until the next session. In the event, Abse swiftly agreed to that amendment\u2014as he had always planned to do\u2014and the committee stage was over within an hour. Before this final debate, he had spent the day circling the tea rooms and bars of the Commons, bestowing wide smiles, witticisms and promises of future support. \u201cIt\u2019s not just house-to-house fighting,\u201d he liked to say. \u201cIt\u2019s room-to-room.\u201d", "Praying for time", "The night wore on. Again and again, that great clock tolled. Still, the diehards spoke on, each digression pootling along until chancing upon another.", "First came the member for Bromsgrove: \u201cWhen we last discussed this unpleasant subject, I raised the history of two young people who were taken from this country to the south of France...\u201d", "MR SPEAKER: \u201cOrder. I hope that the honourable gentleman is not going to repeat the story. We have a long debate ahead of us.\u201d", "The member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, chipped in: \u201cI am not clear on what my honourable friend is saying about this sentence. He referred to it as a sentence for five years...\u201d", "MR SPEAKER: \u201cOrder. When an honourable member is trying to get back into order, an intervention should not encourage him to go out of order again.\u201d", "Then the member for Southport, anxious lest his long and rambling speech be misinterpreted: \u201cI hope that we shall have no more of the nonsense that we have had in the House and the press that if someone dares to have a different point of view\u2014on detail, for I am keeping to the amendment\u2014and dares deploy an argument about it, that is filibustering. I am sorry to see those, self-styled, of enlightened opinion being so intolerant of the opinions of others. That was, in fact, my last but one general observation...\u201d", "MR SPEAKER: \u201cOrder.\u201d", "How am I gonna get through?", "One by one, Abse\u2019s supporters were shuffling off to bed. Fatigue was winning. On the first motion to halt discussion and move to a vote on an amendment, at 11.37pm, Abse had 135 supporters, comfortably more than the threshold of 100. By the second, at 1.25am, he had only 116. It was, he said, \u201con a razor\u2019s edge\u201d.", "And still the opposition went on talking. Every argument was advanced. Any possibility to run down the clock was seized. Since the bill would decriminalise gay sex only in private, what would happen, the member for Bromsgrove wanted to know, if two men were spotted through their hotel window?", "The member for Birmingham, Selly Oak speculated on the motivations of the bill\u2019s supporters. \u201cAccording to the figures we have heard and seen published, there is quite a percentage of people who practise homosexual acts. It would be strange indeed, in a place of 600 members, if there were not some here\u2026\u201d (Lord Arran, whose other great cause was badgers, reached the same conclusion. Asked why his badger-cruelty bill failed, he replied: \u201cNot many badgers in the House of Lords.\u201d)", "Big Ben was about to ring out again by the time the member for Bromsgrove turned his attention to the matter of sleeper trains:", "\u201cTwo passengers who occupy adjoining sleepers after boarding a train at Euston are committing no breach of British Railways by-laws if they indulge in this practice, but as soon as the train crosses the border and goes into Scotland they are committing an offence. Is this the right way to leave a bill? Are British Railways sleeping-car staff to receive instructions to blow a whistle at the border?\u201d", "At length, seven and a half hours into the night, the bill\u2019s opponents had exhausted all their arguments. Or perhaps they were just exhausted. In the end, there was no need for another closure motion. The member for St Albans made one last attempt to stall. Now that the amendments had been considered, he argued, the debate should be adjourned to another day. The Speaker refused, and a substantive vote was finally called, at 5.44am. Fourteen diehards had lasted all night, voting against the bill to the bitter end. Across the lobby, there were 99 \u201cAyes\u201d. Abse had won, by attrition.", "It had been a long road. For Jenkins, who would have little sleep before Independence Day drinks at the American Embassy and an afternoon at the Wimbledon tennis championships. (Full enjoyment, indeed.) For Lord Arran who, under such strain for so long, had been \u201cpermanently if slightly pickled\u201d for more than a year. Once, when someone scrawled \u201cArran homo\u201d on the walls of his club, he \u201chardly dared to hold my head high. Indeed I thought of resigning from my club until I woke up and said to myself \u2018Why the bloody hell should I?\u2019\u201d And, of course, for Abse, who went on to champion more private members\u2019 bills than any other parliamentarian of his generation. He wanted to be remembered as \u201cthe member for happiness\u201d.", "With many a winding turn", "His bill was imperfect. Since it made a specific offence of sex in public toilets, prosecutions rose in the decade after the bill was passed. By modern standards, the arguments he and Lord Arran deployed were themselves prejudiced: homosexuality was a \u201ccondition\u201d to be pitied and not to be \u201cflaunted\u201d. And gay sex remained illegal in Scotland until 1980 and in Northern Ireland until 1982. It is still outlawed in 68 countries. Still, that night those stout fellows\u2014men and women\u2014loosened the shackles a little. Blackmail grew rarer; the closet door was left ajar.", "As Abse, shattered, triumphant, emerged into Westminster Palace Yard, the gas lamps were still burning. Collapsing into his second-hand Rolls-Royce, he drove home to his wife, Marjorie, \u201cwho was in bed, still awake, anxiously awaiting me and my news. She took me into her arms.\u201d It was a year before Mr Wells, the phonetician, met another man, Gabriel. They moved in three weeks later. With Gabriel\u2019s support, he stopped going to psychotherapy; he realised it was society, not him, that had a problem. Today, 52 years on, they are still together. In 2006, as soon as they were able to, they signed a civil partnership. That long night was at an end. At long last, daylight was coming. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["sex", "littleknown", "night", "britain", "jenkins", "mp", "bill", "rights", "welsh", "politician", "helped", "little", "house", "abse", "long", "gay", "member"], "pubDate": "2020-12-19T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
