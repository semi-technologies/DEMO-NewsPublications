This feature originally appeared in issue 269 of Game Informer magazine.", "Link\u2019s Awakening for the Game Boy was more than just a handheld offshoot of a popular franchise. It established important Zelda staples in terms of story, humor, and a focus on character development that the series still uses to this day, all while carving an identity that remains distinct more than 20 years later.", "Link\u2019s Awakening was the first Zelda to feature fishing, allow Link to grab cuccos, and highlight musical instruments as more than just another item in Link\u2019s inventory. The game also had extended side quests, like the mission to find all the secret seashells and a trading game with the world\u2019s inhabitants. Link\u2019s Game Boy adventure was a huge success for Nintendo, dramatically boosting handheld sales in 1993 and selling more than 5 million copies over its lifetime. It sits comfortably at number three on Game Informer\u2019s top 25 Game Boy games of all time list, and also cracked the top 100 on our Top 200 Games of All Time list.", "For players who grew up with the Game Boy instead of a home console, Link\u2019s Awakening was the entry point into one of Nintendo\u2019s most important and popular franchises. But in many ways the game was meant to be a strange love letter to the Zelda games that came before it. In an Iwata Asks interview with Nintendo \u2013 where the company\u2019s late president and CEO Satoru Iwata shared stories with the creators of its most successful games \u2013 Link\u2019s Awakening director Takashi Tezuka said that during development it felt like the team was making a parody of a Zelda game, as opposed to a true Zelda entry.", "\u201cWhen we say parody, I\u2019m not sure where that word comes from because maybe there are translation issues,\u201d Tezuka told us when we asked what he meant by that comment. \u201cWith Zelda games we usually plan them out, every detail is considered. With Link\u2019s Awakening, we were working on that after our other work was done. Kind of like a club of people who loved Zelda and got together to make it. It has a different feeling for that reason.\u201d", "The original plan for Zelda\u2019s first Game Boy adventure was to bring a modified version of Link to the Past to the handheld, but that idea fell by the wayside. Instead, Link\u2019s Awakening started as an unsanctioned after-hours passion project for members of the Link to the Past team. \u201cThe main programmer wanted to challenge himself to create a Zelda experience on a portable system to see what he could do, and I was into the idea. We just had a passion to try and do something interesting,\u201d Tezuka says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have permission to do it necessarily. We were just playing around.\u201d", "It didn\u2019t take long for the game to become more than an after-hours experiment. \u201cOnce we got it to a certain level of creation and completion that we wanted to show, then we took it to the company and got permission to continue developing it,\u201d Tezuka says. \u201cBut initially it was just a little pet project of ours. Because we started it that way \u2013 just making a game we wanted to make \u2013 it may defy Zelda conventions. It might have interesting characters and situations we may not have had otherwise.\u201d", "Link\u2019s Reawakening Two versions of Link\u2019s Awakening exist. The original released on the Game Boy in 1993. In 1998, Nintendo followed up with Link\u2019s Awakening DX for the Game Boy Color. This version added a new dungeon and compatibility with the Game Boy Printer, allowing players to print out in-game photos after visiting a camera shop. The expanded DX version of the game is available on Nintendo\u2019s eShop for the 3DS.", "At the time of development, Twin Peaks was at the height of its popularity. The show\u2019s dreamlike world and focus on a small cast of characters in a small town were elements Tezuka wanted represented in the game. As a result, Link\u2019s Awakening was one of the first Zelda games to have a stronger focus on story. Link built relationships with NPCs with more dialogue interactions, had extended conversations with Marin (the girl who found him washed up on shore after his boat crashed), and was guided along his journey periodically by an owl (who would later make an appearance in Ocarina of Time). \u201cI wanted to make something that, while it would be small enough in scope to easily understand, it would have deep and distinctive characteristics,\u201d Tezuka said during his Iwata Asks interview. Link\u2019s Awakening was about more than just solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and saving Zelda. Koholint Island was far different from Hyrule, and its characters were charming and mysterious. This was why many callouts from other Nintendo games made their way in.", "Link\u2019s Awakening featured strange scenarios that served as the platform for cameos from Mario, Yoshi, and Kirby, as well as Mario enemies like goombas and chain-chomps. Reminiscing about the game with his boss during the Iwata Asks interview, Tezuka admitted he wasn\u2019t even sure if he got official permission from Kirby\u2019s creators, HAL Laboratory, to include him in the game.", "Alongside Majora\u2019s Mask, Link\u2019s Awakening continues to be among the stranger entries in the Zelda series. With its Twin Peaks influences, myriad outside Nintendo references, strange characters, and surprise ending, the game stands out despite its limited visuals and smaller world. It was the first Zelda game for many young players, and will retain its legacy for years to come even as handheld gaming technology moves forward at a brisk pace."]}
