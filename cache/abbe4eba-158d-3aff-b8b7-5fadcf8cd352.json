The story was inspired by Pollack\u2019s hometown of Austin, Texas.", "\u201cI\u2019ve lived here on and off for 20 years, and I\u2019ve gradually watched it go from being a party town with a laid back culture to being this fancy-shmancy tech hub,\u201d Pollack says in Episode 439 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. \u201cThe marketing of that bohemia, and turning it into this simulacrum of what it once was, I found it ridiculous and also kind of hilarious. So Keep Mars Weird is a futuristic sci-fi take on gentrification, basically.\u201d", "The title Keep Mars Weird is a play on the phrase \u201cKeep Austin Weird,\u201d which Pollack says began as a rallying cry against commercialization and conformity but was quickly co-opted into a marketing slogan. \u201c\u2018Weirdness\u2019 became something that was a corporate buzzword, so people could come down here and feel funky for a few days before flying back to their expensive condos or mansions,\u201d he says.", "The climax of the novel features a clash between armed revolutionaries and corporate mercenaries at the annual Mars by Mars festival, a thinly veiled reference to South by Southwest. Pollack says that South by Southwest, which began as an indie music festival but soon morphed into a Silicon Valley networking event, is emblematic of the changes that have come to Austin.", "Still, for all his reservations about the city\u2019s growth, he admits that the pandemic has given him a greater appreciation for South by Southwest. \u201cI missed it when it was gone,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad when I can go wander around and listen to Japanese punk rock bands again.\u201d", "Listen to the complete interview with Neal Pollack in Episode 439 of Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.", "Neal Pollack on Amazon Publishing:", "\u201cThey hired good editors to work with me, and put clever covers on everything. I had no real problems with them. I would say the one problem with putting out books through Amazon Publishing is that they weren\u2019t in bookstores, so it all had to be sold through the website. They sold quite a good number of copies, but because it was Amazon, it didn\u2019t get any bookstore play. It was hard to book events, because independent bookstores, which had previously been my bread and butter, didn\u2019t want to work with Amazon, and it was hard to get press and reviews. So the books operated in this separate publishing ecosystem, where they sold as many copies\u2014if not more\u2014as my previous books, but they were kind of invisible to the naked eye.\u201d", "Neal Pollack on fame:", "\u201c[Dave Eggers] told me that he wanted to start a publishing company, and we came up with the idea for this character \u2018The Greatest Living American Writer,\u2019 who was a parody of literary lions and pompous magazine journalists, making fun of Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal and whatnot, and we put this book together called the Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature. I finished it in May of 2000, and by September of 2000 it was out, and there was a full-page review in the New York Times Book Review. I was profiled in Men\u2019s Journal, I was named the \u2018hot writer of the year\u2019 by Rolling Stone magazine. It was crazy. There you go. Suddenly I was a relatively famous writer. It was incredible.\u201d", "Neal Pollack on his memoir Pothead:", "\u201cIt\u2019s gratifying if I can help someone else, or give them a sense of hope that they\u2019re not alone in believing that they have a problem. Because there\u2019s a lot in our culture that says that marijuana is good for you, or that it\u2019s harmless\u2014even more harmless than something like alcohol, certainly more harmless than harder drugs. So when people say they have a problem with marijuana, a lot of times society pooh-poohs them, refuses to believe them, dismisses their addiction. And my book, while I wouldn\u2019t call it a \u2018scared straight\u2019 narrative, or even a warning necessarily\u2014because I do escape the worst consequences of addiction\u2014I think it\u2019s a kind of counter-narrative to what marijuana lovers and the marijuana industry puts out.\u201d", "Neal Pollack on politics:", "\u201cKeep Mars Weird makes fun of lots of different things, including the radical left and their revolutionary fervor, which is just another source of societal misery. The corporation causes societal misery, the people who are fighting the corporations cause misery, the government causes misery. Everyone causes misery for everyone else, and really at the end of the day the individual suffers, and we really all just want to be left alone to be free to do our thing. Anyone with these millennialist visions of a better world, they never quite turn out like we think they\u2019re going to. \u2026 Everyone\u2019s vision is destructive in one way or another, and we\u2019re all just getting battered around like balls in a bingo shaker.\u201d", "More Great WIRED Stories"], "authors": ["Geek'S Guide To The Galaxy", "Powered Outbrain", "Kayla Lacour", "Echo Esc_Html", "Wired_Get_The_Byline_Name", "Related_Video"], "keywords": ["misery", "weird", "austin", "marijuana", "southwest", "hilarious", "satire", "south", "mars", "book", "amazon", "writer", "pollack"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
