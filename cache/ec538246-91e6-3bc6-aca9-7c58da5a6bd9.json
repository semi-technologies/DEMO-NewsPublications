Here are 10 imaginative ways to make the most of them \u2013 without waiting for Christmas", "Proving once and for all that even the worst among us are capable of redemption, the brussels sprout has just been named the nation\u2019s favourite green vegetable. For years, the sprout was little more than a waxy green pariah, bought out of duty once a year at Christmas and then ignored. But now, in what can only be described as an astonishing turnaround, a Waitrose survey revealed that people now prefer them even to the mighty broccoli.", "This means it\u2019s all systems go. Now that the nation is finally united by its love of sprouts, it\u2019s time to get adventurous. Sure, they are nice with a bit of bacon, but serve any of the following recipes to friends next time you\u2019re allowed, and they will fall to their knees and weep with gratitude.", "Sprout pizza", "Technically, this is a flatbread rather than a pizza \u2013 there\u2019s no tomato sauce, just cheese, onion and brussels sprouts \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t completely delicious. Better yet, Bon Appetit suggests serving it with fried eggs. If this isn\u2019t on every Domino\u2019s menu in the country by Christmas, it will be a travesty.", "Sprout dip", "It\u2019s a situation we\u2019ve all found ourselves in; hungry for sprouts, but not in a setting that lends itself to formal dining. Luckily, Martha Stewart has the answer: a warm sprout dip enlivened by Greek yoghurt and Neufch\u00e2tel cheese. Technically, you can dip what you like into this, but if it isn\u2019t sprouts you\u2019re a fool.", "Bacon-wrapped sprouts", "Look, we all know that bacon and sprouts is a match made in heaven, but what if you want to tell the world that you\u2019re a dangerous overachiever with nothing left to lose? Why, that\u2019s when you break out the Recipe Critics\u2019s recipe for bacon-wrapped sprouts. That\u2019s right, every sprout is individually wrapped in bacon, doused in maple syrup and brown sugar, then roasted. You might call it needlessly complicated, but that\u2019s only because you aren\u2019t a true believer.", "Sprout smoothies", "This makes sense because a) green smoothies are a thing and sprouts are green; and b) sometimes it\u2019s hard to consume sprouts in public. SparkRecipes\u2019 sprout smoothie is simplicity itself. Half a cup of spinach, half a cup of sprouts, an apple and some almond milk. Blitz it up and nobody will ever know that you\u2019re drinking sprouts. Unless you tell them, which you should.", "Sprout cake", "Until Bake Off does a sprout week, Food52 has an intriguing recipe for sprout cake. In truth, it\u2019s more of a savoury sprout scone topped with garlic and cheese. \u201cThe inspiration for this recipe came to me during a lecture about migration and transnationalism,\u201d says the author, which makes perfect sense.", "Caramelised sprouts", "This is a simple roasted sprout dish, taken into the stratosphere by DIY Candy\u2019s idea to fry them in an apple-cider caramel before putting them in the oven. The resulting dish is a perfect showcase for the sprout\u2019s natural sweetness and, as the author states, \u201cbridges the gap between salad and dessert\u201d. Send that woman a Nobel prize.", "Kung pao sprouts", "If you want your sprout to carry more of a kick, then Cookie and Kate\u2019s kung pao brussels sprout recipe will do the trick in spades.

In one fell swoop, you have created the sprout equivalent of popcorn chicken. Imagine, a movie night on the sofa with a big bowl of piping hot sprouts to share.
