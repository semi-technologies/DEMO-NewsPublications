She pushed the food around on her plate. Ms. Viswanath asked if she would be taking a citizenship test soon. Ms. Peren\u2019s lawyers explained that such a possibility was years away. Her asylum case, a first step, had not even begun.", "Ms. Peren said good night and settled into her room: the first in her life that she had not had to share. But she felt so lonely and unable to communicate that she cried herself to sleep.", "Without a job, Ms. Peren fell into a familiar role as a house cleaner while she waited for the government to approve her son\u2019s release.
