Minutes later the British men\u2019s 4x100m team repeated the trick, breaking the European record to come second behind a stacked US quartet, to bring Britain\u2019s medal haul to five at these world championships.", "Afterwards Asher-Smith praised her teammates, Daryll Neita, Asha Philip and Ashleigh Nelson, for helping her achieve an historic hat-trick \u2013 especially as Philip had to replace Imani-Lara Lansiquot, who aggravated a thigh injury just before the race. \u201cWe all handled the situation fantastically,\u201d said Asher-Smith, after the British team had come home in a season\u2019s best 41.85sec. \u201cIt is a testament to our experience as a squad. We have done how many championships now? We have the experience to switch people around and it was almost a PB with no practice in warm-up areas. This is a team event, and it is testament to our hard work.\u201d", "Neita, meanwhile, lavished compliments on Asher-Smith. \u201cShe knows how proud we are,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s been doing her thing since day one. She\u2019s killing it, she\u2019s smashing it. She\u2019s a G. You are doing bits, darling. You are doing bits.\u201d", "Philip, who ran a superb first leg before passing the baton to Asher-Smith, added: \u201cImani wasn\u2019t feeling 100%. I was ready as a team member. In the relay you have to be ready for any situation. Imani didn\u2019t feel comfortable and stood aside as she didn\u2019t want to put team into jeopardy.\u201d", "If anything the British men\u2019s team of Adam Gemili, Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake were even more impressive on the night, setting a European record of 37.36 to take silver behind a US team that ran 37.10 \u2013 the third fastest time in history \u2013 despite Hughes feeling a hamstring niggle just before the race. \u201cIt felt incredible,\u201d said Kilty. \u201cWhat more could we ask? It took the third fastest time in history to beat us. That was the best team America have ever assembled. Zharnel, what a warrior. He went through a pulled hamstring to deliver me that baton. And we\u2019re so proud of each other.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Britain\u2019s Zharnel Hughes (second right) sprints towards the finish line.

Those inside the team say that after the nadir of nadirs at the 2015 world championships \u2013 when the team turned on each other in Beijing after bungling their final changeover \u2013 they had help from British Athletics\u2019 lead performance psychologist, Jen Savage, who has spent the last few years turning strife into harmony.", "\u201cJen Savage has been absolutely amazing,\u201d said Kilty. \u201cAnd the work she\u2019s done has been incredible. But we had to buy into that. You know, we\u2019re like a family. We have so much faith in each other, it\u2019s just amazing.\u201d", "\u201cI believe we can run 36 seconds,\u201d he added. \u201cWe get faster every single year no matter who is in the team.\u201d", "However on the night they were no match for the US squad of Christian Coleman, Justin Gatlin, Michael Rodgers and Noah Lyles, who blitzed to glory. When it was put to Kilty that Coleman had faced issues with missing doping tests and Gatlin had been banned twice, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one to cause controversy again but you all know my thoughts.\u201d", "Elsewhere, both Laura Weightman and Eilish McColgan ran personal bests as they finished seventh and 10th in the women\u2019s 5,000m final.", "Weightman, who ran 14min 44.57sec, said: \u201cIt\u2019s mixed emotions I think. I\u2019m delighted with my PB, but I know I\u2019m in 14:30 shape and when the gap was made I couldn\u2019t cover it. There\u2019s a lot more to come and in my first global championships to come seventh I am delighted.\u201d", "Meanwhile McColgan, who was 10th in 14:46.17, added: \u201cI knew from training that I was in great shape but it is not easy going out and setting the pace for everyone. It\u2019s a little bit frustrating. I would have liked to have pushed into that top eight.\u201d", "The race was won by Kenya\u2019s Hellen Obiri in a championship record 14:26.72, while her compatriot Margaret Kipkemboi was second just under three seconds back. The German Konstanze Klosterhalfen, who was coached at the Nike Oregon Project by Alberto Salazar until his drug ban last week, took bronze."], "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
