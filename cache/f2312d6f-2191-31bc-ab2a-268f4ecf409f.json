That got him through the release of the Access Hollywood tape\u2014on which he boasted about grabbing women between the legs a month before the 2016 election\u2014and also through Robert Mueller\u2019s report, which identified acts that could amount to obstruction of justice. But past success is no guarantee of future performance.", "Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, announced on September 24th that the House was beginning a formal impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump over allegations that he abused his power by encouraging Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, to investigate Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm, and his father Joe, a front-runner in the Democratic primaries. Since then Mr Trump has seemed rattled. He has decried impeachment as \u201ca COUP intended to take away the Power of the People\u201d (it is a constitutional process that would still leave America with a Republican president if it removed Mr Trump).", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "He has said that Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, should be \u201cquestioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason\u201d for unfavourably paraphrasing his phone call with Mr Zelensky (legislative immunity protects Mr Schiff). He has spoken of \u201ca Civil War like fracture in this nation\u201d if he is removed from office. He has warned that he is \u201ctrying to find out\u201d the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint inspired the impeachment inquiry\u2014and whose anonymity federal law protects. He has falsely claimed that whistleblower rules changed just before this one acted\u2014drawing a rare rebuke from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector-general. And he accused Mr Schiff, without evidence, of helping to write the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.", "The number of officials drawn into the inquiry is growing. On October 2nd Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, said that he was on the phone call between Messrs Trump and Zelensky; he has also been subpoenaed. House Democrats are looking into Rick Perry, the energy secretary, who travelled to Ukraine in May. They are also interested in William Barr, the attorney-general, whose Justice Department initially blocked the release of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, and who Mr Trump implicated in his efforts to enlist foreign governments\u2019 help in investigating Mr Biden. The House has also subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, for documents and communications related to Ukraine.", "So far no House Republicans have backed Ms Pelosi\u2019s inquiry. Two say they support \u201coversight\u201d, but not impeachment hearings. Most have offered arguments\u2014the whistleblower was not on the call, there was no direct quid pro quo, the call was consistent with American concerns about corruption in Ukraine\u2014that are not quite a full-throated defence of the president. Mr Trump, meanwhile, has used the threat of impeachment to turbocharge fundraising. In the days after Ms Pelosi\u2019s announcement his campaign pulled in $15m and, according to his campaign manager, at least 50,000 new donors.", "Conventional wisdom says that Senate Republicans are Mr Trump\u2019s bulwark\u2014that the 20 Republicans required will never vote for removal, even if the Democrat-controlled House impeaches. That will probably hold. Although some Republican senators will trash Mr Trump off-the-record, so far only Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse have come near to publicly rebuking the president; Mr Romney said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by Mr Trump\u2019s behaviour.", "But politicians respond to public opinion. The latest YouGov/Economist poll finds that half of all registered voters, including 11% of Republicans, believe the House should \u201ctry to impeach\u201d Mr Trump, and 51% of voters, including 13% of Republicans, think that if the House impeaches Mr Trump, the Senate should vote to remove him from office. Over two-thirds of registered voters believe that abuse of power and obstruction of justice warrant removal. This doubtless sets Democratic hearts aflutter. But broad support for the notion that Mr Trump\u2019s conduct was impeachable is not enough to convince a critical mass of Republican senators. Mr Trump often turns politics into a loyalty test. And Republicans usually let him have his way.\u25a0"], "pubDate": null}
