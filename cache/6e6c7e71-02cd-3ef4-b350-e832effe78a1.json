It\u2019s especially unnecessary when you have purse-friendly gems like this. I like the intense moisture (that\u2019s the avocado and shea butter) and love that it is non-sticky. The scent, a fresh orange, lemon oil and neroli concoction, is also a win. Its USP, however, is that it diminishes dark spots and regulates melanin production. We\u2019re all guilty of neglecting our hands \u2013 we don\u2019t treat them like the skin on our face and so they show the greatest signs of age and sun damage. This cream tackles that and the impressive stats back this up \u2013 92% of users found their dark spots significantly diminished over a couple of months. The secret is viniferine, a plant-based active ingredient 62 times more powerful than Vitamin C. I have long-loved Caudalie\u2019s Vinoperfect products \u2013 which all include this miracle ingredient to combat hyper-pigmentation \u2013 and can categorically say it\u2019s an ingredient that works.
