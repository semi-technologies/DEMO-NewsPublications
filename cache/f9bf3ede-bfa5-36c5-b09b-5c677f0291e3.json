They peaked at 394 rupees ($5.64) in August 2018, and have staggered downwards ever since. On October 1st they hit 32 rupees after a 23% drop on the day, before rising by 23% on October 3rd as The Economist went to press.", "Yes is not alone in its troubles. The shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance, the second-largest home lender\u2014and, not coincidentally, a big borrower from Yes\u2014have also plummeted. Late last month the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ), the central bank, suddenly capped withdrawals from a small lender, Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank. That brought into the open what a police investigation now alleges was a vast lending fraud. Rumours of similar issues at other financial institutions prompted the RBI to tweet on October 1st reassuring \u201cthe general public that the Indian banking system is safe and stable and there is no need to panic\u201d.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "That is unlikely to help. Such words from a financial authority are prone to be heard as a signal to stampede. Even if that is averted, India\u2019s banks are obviously faltering. They are still dealing with the overhang from a splurge of bad lending years ago. Yes Bank is merely a particularly marked example. The RBI has been concerned about the source of its seemingly impressive growth for some time.", "But only in January this year did the regulator push out the bank\u2019s founder and chief executive, Rana Kapoor. Write-offs followed, but there are worries about what remains to be uncovered. A report by Credit Suisse estimated that 9.4% of Yes Bank\u2019s loans are in the process of being restructured\u2014far higher than the 2.8% average for India\u2019s other banks. It will probably need to raise capital, but that will be hard.", "Although Yes\u2019s problems are real, market movements may be exaggerating them. Some of the selling pressure has come from the forced liquidation of a large stake that had been retained by Mr Kapoor but pledged as collateral for loans. Holding companies linked to him have also sold shares to cut their debt. These sales created a vicious circle that may now be exhausted. The optimistic case for India\u2019s banks is that something similar is playing out across the financial system: real problems, and an overheated market response. But for the market-watchers who have become accustomed to shocks, India\u2019s banks steadying themselves would be a real surprise.\u25a0"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/10/03/it-has-been-a-torrid-week-for-indian-banks", "title": "It has been a torrid week for Indian banks", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["real", "shares", "yes", "indian", "indias", "system", "financial", "bank", "rbi", "similar", "torrid", "banks", "week"]}
