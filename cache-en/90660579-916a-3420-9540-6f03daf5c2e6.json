In 2010, Washington won a Tony Award for his portrayal of the protagonist, a 1950s sanitation worker named Troy Maxson, in the Broadway revival of Wilson\u2019s most lauded work, \u201cFences\u201d (1985). In 2014, the Wilson estate, led by the playwright\u2019s widow, Constanza Romero, now 62, approached the actor about adapting the entire Pittsburgh Cycle to film, beginning with the 2016 film version of \u201cFences,\u201d which Washington directed, produced and starred in opposite Davis, who won an Oscar for her role as Maxson\u2019s beleaguered wife, Rose.", "Washington sees his responsibility as both Hollywood connector and Wilson custodian. He convinced Wolfe, 66, the renowned theater director, to helm the new film; and then worked with Romero to hire his friend Samuel L. Jackson and his son, John David Washington, to appear in the next Wilson film, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d (1987), a 1930s saga about ghosts and a family heirloom that will be overseen by Barry Jenkins. For the rest of the Cycle, which will be shot out of order over the following years, directors and actors such as Ryan Coogler, Ava DuVernay and Laurence Fishburne are all \u201ccircling,\u201d Washington says. Over the phone this fall, he compared this undertaking to a relay race, passing on the baton in hopes of winning new audiences for the classics that Wilson left behind. \u201cLord knows he couldn\u2019t take them with him,\u201d Washington says. \u201cAnd thank God he did leave them. Now they\u2019ve left them in my hands, and I put them in other people\u2019s hands.\u201d", "DAVIS, 55, STILL remembers an early encounter with the character Ma Rainey: She was a theater student at Rhode Island College in the 1980s, when one night she saw the stage and television actress Barbara Meek in a local production. \u201cThe thing that blew me away was how unapologetic she was \u2014 without screaming, without yelling, without doing any of that \u2014 just navigating her worth,\u201d Davis recalls. \u201cI have never seen that level of agency and autonomy.\u201d", "Ma is a standout role even in the context of Wilson\u2019s works, which are populated with confident Black characters who either seek or declare their power within a system that would deny them: who try to get promoted at work, who try to open record shops and restaurants, who supplicate themselves before white peers to get ahead, who fight back against those same white peers or even step over other Black people to advance. Still, Ma stands out for another reason, too: Wilson\u2019s plays are often ruled by men, whether they\u2019re scrapping for cash or hanging in shops. And Ma is not just a Black woman at the center of her story, but a queer one, an identity otherwise absent in Wilson\u2019s oeuvre. Rarely do gay Black women receive the spotlight, and certainly not in the mid-1980s, when the play arrived in New York. Nor in the 1920s, when the real Ma \u2014 and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, the blues singer Bessie Smith \u2014 was part of a crew of queer Black female artists. (Ma\u2019s lyrics often referenced her attraction to women, as in \u201cProve It on Me Blues\u201d [1928]: \u201cWent out last night with a crowd of my friends. / It must\u2019ve been women, \u2019cause I don\u2019t like no men.\u201d) In the theatrical version, Ma has one woman in her entourage, Dussie Mae, with whom she flirts and of whom she becomes possessive, though she never speaks of sexuality aloud: a notable omission for a character rooted in the Black community, where queerness has historically been, and is often still, marginalized and stigmatized."], "authors": ["Maya Phillips"], "keywords": ["film", "won", "washington", "wilsons", "woman", "wilson", "work", "bard", "women", "black", "american", "ma"], "pubDate": "2020-12-03T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
