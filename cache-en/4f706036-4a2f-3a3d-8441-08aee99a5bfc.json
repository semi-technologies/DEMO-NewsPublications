The hook? The center\u2019s focus on both Eastern and Western medicine: you could attend both a sports coaching and Ayurvedic session, see a physical therapist and an acupuncturist, go to the gym and get a massage, all under the same roof. It was the ultimate place to destress and escape the metropolitan hustle and bustle.", "Now, The Well is branching out from the city to the country. On December 8, co-founders Rebecca Parekh, Sarrah Hallock, and Kane Sarhan will open their second outpost at The Mayflower Inn, the bucolic Litchfield County getaway beloved by locals and weekenders alike.", "\u201cWe always knew that we would want to create a retreat-style product for The Well,\u201d says Sarhan. \u201cThe Mayflower Inn is an institution, had just gone through a major renovation, and is located just outside of NYC, so it was a win across the board.\u201d", "Their new center\u2019s immediate attraction is its serene surrounding: overlooking The Mayflower\u2019s placid pond and rolling hiking hills, it\u2019s an atmosphere that quiets the mind with the visuals alone. The Well at Mayflower Inn takes full advantage of this setting. Weather permitting, many of its treatments take place in the outdoors\u2014you can have a Forest Craniosacral treatment under a trio of autumnal trees, or a Midnight Gong Bath on their expansive lawn."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["opened", "citys", "sarhan", "country", "inn", "destination", "place", "western", "mayflower", "wellness", "york", "buzziest", "retreat", "win", "city", "centers"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
