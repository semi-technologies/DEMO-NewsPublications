The 22-year-old star has been performing since her early teens and was used to working 24/7. But Larsson\u2019s schedule\u2014and nearly everyone else\u2019s\u2014ground to a halt once lockdown began. The change meant more time to spend with friends and family while at home but it also allowed Larsson the space to evaluate what it means to be busy. \u201cI always want something stimulating, and I feel my best when I\u2019m busy and have a purpose [so] it\u2019s been hard during these times,\u201d she shared via Zoom from Stockholm. \u201cThis year has taught me a little about myself. I understand now that my worth isn\u2019t tied to how productive I am.\u201d", "Things may have slowed down, but when it\u2019s time to put on a show, Larsson goes all out. Last month for MTV\u2019s European Music Awards in London, Larsson brought the house down with an epic performance of her single \u201cWow\u201d complete with choreography by JaQuel Knight. While in town, Larsson settled back into a busier schedule. She had a few recording sessions, put the finishing touches on a forthcoming music video, and enjoyed a little downtime in her artsy Airbnb. Documenting each moment with photographer Michaela Quan, Larsson threw herself into a special diary for Vogue.", "Though it\u2019s clear she\u2019s found ways to stay stimulated, Larsson is eager to get back to doing what she loves. \u201cAs an artist, you have an existential crisis when you aren\u2019t working,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think that hopefully next year, we\u2019re going to get back to some form of normalcy. I\u2019ve learned that I need routines, I need people around me who ground me, and [to be] doing what I love. 2020 has been tricky, but I know I\u2019m not the only one who feels that.\u201d", "Below, she takes Vogue along for her London trip."], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["larsson", "music", "doing", "need", "london", "working", "busy", "staying", "2020", "im", "zara", "stimulated", "lockdown", "little"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
