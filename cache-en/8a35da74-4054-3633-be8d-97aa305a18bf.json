For homemade ice, the supply chain is reassuringly familiar: water goes into the freezer, and a bit later, ice comes out. But what about the ice cubes that you bought from a supermarket, or extracted, by the handful, from a plastic bag at a drinks party? They were frozen when you took possession of them; they are long gone now. Where did they start out, back when they were water?", "Follow their journey all the way back from the point of sale \u2013 through warehouses and depots and cold storage facilities and innumerable temperature-controlled lorries \u2013 and there\u2019s a decent chance that most of them came from the same place: an industrial estate just outside South Kirkby in West Yorkshire. The company that made them is called The Ice Co, and if you haven\u2019t heard of it, you have almost certainly used its products.", "If you have grabbed a bag of ice from the freezer of a corner shop on a hot day, The Ice Co probably supplied it. If you have bought ice from Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose, Morrisons or Ocado, The Ice Co thanks you for your business. If you have ever plonked a bottle of prosecco into a house party ice bucket filled with cylindrical cubes, or pulled a cold can of Coke from the chilling bins at Glastonbury, or \u2013 indeed \u2013 endured the Arctic Enema ice bath obstacle at a Tough Mudder endurance course, it is highly likely that the ice originated in The Ice Co\u2019s ice factory, a long, flat building nestled in the countryside between Doncaster and Leeds.", "Like central heating and hot water, ice is one of those minor luxuries we scarcely think to notice. And yet The Ice Co has turned frozen water into a \u00a338m brand \u2013 at a retail price of roughly \u00a31 a bag, that equates to plenty of people indulging every year.", "It is perhaps surprising that there is even a market for packaged ice in the UK \u2013 let alone one that requires The Ice Co to produce 400 tonnes of the stuff per day, or 5bn cubes per year. We do not lack the specialised equipment required to make our own ice: 98% of British homes contain some form of freezer. We do not, as a rule, have issues with our drinking water, so freezing our own in plastic or silicone trays is not unsafe. While British summers can be warm, they are nothing like summer in the southern US\u2019s so-called Sun Belt, the modern ice trade\u2019s heartland, where the largest operators produce over 1bn cubes a day. We do not, strictly speaking, even need ice in our drinks \u2013 no one does! \u2013 which means that we must have acquired a taste for it; so much so, over the years, that we are now willing to pay for the privilege.", "The Ice Co is not only dominant in its own marketplace. As a supplier of a perishable good to major retailers, it is evaluated alongside \u2013 and frequently outperforms \u2013 some of the UK\u2019s most dynamic food and drink brands. Indeed, it recently beat out enterprises such as the \u201c100% plant-based\u201d food company Fullgreen and the premium bar-snack provider Made For Drink to land SME brand of the year at the prestigious Grocer Gold Awards. Those companies, just like former winners Fever-Tree, have something that can be evaluated relative to the competition, whether it be superior flavour, a distinctive brand personality or a clearly identifiable ethical stance.", "Ice, though, has no rough edges on which a consumer\u2019s imagination can find purchase. \u201cChaste as ice,\u201d Shakespeare wrote. \u201cThe simplest solid thing you can buy in the supermarket,\u201d noted a modern historian of the subject. Ice is perhaps the most purely fungible product any of us will ever buy: if it\u2019s clear, fits into a glass, and is solid at the freezing point of water, it has fulfilled the only meaningful criteria that most end users will ever care about.", "And so, as much as the Ice Co\u2019s success is a result of technological innovation, and of shrewdly moving in step with evolving tastes, it is also a story of near-constant struggle, as generations of icemen and icewomen have sought out ways to sell people something that has only ever been, and will only ever be, frozen water. That The Ice Co has done it on such a large scale is doubly remarkable: ice is not just featureless, it is also evanescent. How do you build an empire out of something born to melt?", "Kept below zero, ice is rock-hard, unchanging. Once it reaches its melting point, though, in a textbook example of entropy, its molecules start to agitate and chafe within their crystalline lattice, until they finally slip their hydrogen bonds and become what ice unfailingly returns to: a puddle of water.", "For centuries, the history of ice was really just the history of attempting to postpone the inevitable. The enterprising hacked the stuff from icebergs and lakes and mountaintops; they transported it at no little personal risk to the houses of the rich, who constructed ice houses and ice safes in which to hoard their treasure.", "The economics of transporting something very heavy and highly perishable meant that ice long remained an unattainable luxury for all but the most wealthy. Ancient potentates flaunted ice as a status symbol: in China, during the Eastern Chou dynasty, an \u201cice-service\u201d detail of 94 people was kept on hand to handle any ice-related business that may occur, from chilling beverages to chilling corpses. Pliny ascribes to the Emperor Nero the invention of the ice bucket, as a method of cooling wine without diluting it with ice that had been stored in pungent straw and cloth. In 17th-century Florence, the Medici family would host elaborate feasts featuring tabletop mountain ranges sculpted from ice (they also acted as patrons to the polymath Bernardo Buontalenti, the pioneer of modern-day ice-cream).", "In 1626, the English philosopher Sir Francis Bacon was one of the first westerners to discover a new use for ice, after packing a dead chicken in snow in the hope of preserving its flesh. He succeeded (in his own words, \u201cexcellently well\u201d), but in so doing unfortunately caught a chill that would, several days later, be the death of him.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ice production in the 19th century. Illustration: World History Archive/Alamy", "It was not until 1785 that Bacon\u2019s insight found widespread acceptance \u2013 and even then, it was only thanks to a chance encounter between one Alexander Dalrymple, an official of the East India Company, and George Dempster, its former director. Dalrymple mentioned in passing that the Chinese fisherman who operated in the waters around the company\u2019s trading post in Canton were in the habit of taking ice on their fishing trips in order to preserve their catch at sea, and then to transport it over long distances once on shore. Dempster was sufficiently intrigued to write to his salmon supplier in Scotland, who sent a consignment of fish on ice, by sea, to London \u2013 it arrived, six days later, perfectly fresh.", "This chance conversation set in motion a booming trade in what had been a hitherto overlooked commodity. When Joseph Marr, The Ice Co\u2019s founding father, decided to expand his fish-curing business in Hull into a fish-catching one, ice was an absolute necessity. When the company moved to Fleetwood on the other side of the country in 1896, in pursuit of hake (then abundant off the UK\u2019s west coast), ice was what his son, James Herbert, imported from Norway, and subsequently stored in a giant cork-lined ice-house. And ice, again, was what the company started to manufacture for itself in 1908, as a third generation of Marrs settled into the daily rhythm of fishing boats coming and going \u2013 leaving stocked with ice, returning stocked with slightly less ice, and fish.", "To Joseph Marr, the idea that people might one day manufacture ice from water would doubtless have seemed fanciful, if not outright sacrilegious. As recently as 1844, when the American inventor John Gorrie took to the pages of the Commercial Advertiser to argue \u201cwe know of no want of mankind more urgent than a cheap means of producing an abundance of artificial cold\u201d, he did so under a pseudonym, for fear of reprisals.", "Gorrie, a doctor who specialised in treating malaria, had already produced a prototype of the modern air conditioner that blew air across a block of ice hanging above a feverish patient. In 1851 he received a US patent for one of the world\u2019s first ice-making machines, which harnessed the cooling properties of pressurised gases as they expanded. He was right to have worried about being deemed heretical: after a successful demonstration of his machine in 1850 at a dinner party at The Mansion hotel in Florida (an event Smithsonian magazine subsequently dubbed \u201cthe chilly reception\u201d), the New York Globe derisively reported that \u201cThere is a Dr Gorrie, a crank down in Apalachicola, Florida, that thinks he can make ice by his machine as good as God Almighty\u201d. But Gorrie did not live to enjoy his vindication: he failed to find financial backers for his product, and died, impoverished, five years later.", "Nevertheless, his discovery set in motion the birth of the second ice trade \u2013 and the death of the first. In 19th-century America (and, to a lesser extent, Britain), ice had been a nation-shaping industry, as the widespread extraction of abundant naturally occurring ice had allowed fresh produce to travel further and stay fresh longer, significantly improving diets in the global north. For years, natural ice was the US\u2019s second-biggest crop by weight to be transported by trains and ships (the first, speaking of nation-shaping commodities, was cotton). But within a couple of generations, a string of innovations pushed the original ice trade into obsolescence.", "First, following Gorrie\u2019s prototype, there was the emergence of \u201cmachine\u201d, or artificially made ice, which gradually supplanted the natural ice trade. Next came a number of inventions that transformed how ice was used within the home, such as the fridge-freezer and the first packaged ice. In the early 20th century in North America, the iceman had been as much a neighbourhood fixture as the postman or paperboy; by the 1970s, all that remained of a once-mighty trade was a patchwork of scattered regional packaged ice suppliers attempting to find scant space in the nation\u2019s freezer compartments.", "When Alan Marr, Joseph Marr\u2019s great-grandson, visited Canada in 1978, his family business was approaching meltdown. Back at home, freezer trawlers \u2013 fishing boats capable of making their own ice on board \u2013 were becoming more widespread, meaning that The Ice Co\u2019s onshore ice-manufacturing facilities risked becoming totally obsolete. But in the new world, Alan saw a new opportunity. He was astonished to see that \u2013 in the words of his granddaughter, Polly Metcalfe, The Ice Co\u2019s current managing director \u2013 \u201cin every single bar and restaurant he went into, they ram-packed the glass full of ice\u201d.", "It wasn\u2019t a huge leap to assume that if people wanted ice in their drinks in Canada (hardly the warmest country in the world), they might want ice in their drinks in the UK, too. Back on home soil, he imported a Vogt ice machine from the US \u2013 which cools water in a tubular system, resulting in the cylindrical cubes so familiar to packaged ice users today \u2013 and got to work making ice for an entirely new market.", "Except, at first, there didn\u2019t seem to be much of a market. It was not until a transformative deal with the US air force base in East Anglia (three truckloads, a huge amount at the time) that it looked like this new venture would make any kind of commercial sense. By 1987, there was enough demand for this strange new product for Charles Marr (Alan\u2019s son) to launch one of the first packaged ice products to hit the British market, choosing the shrewdly egalitarian name Party Ice for a product that would dutifully do its job regardless of whether it was chilling a bottle of champagne or a glass of Coke.", "The freezer aisle of a major supermarket is a cutthroat place to stake a claim: the product, after all, is frozen water, so no retailer in its right mind is going to stock competing brands. Relationships with major retailers are king, and when The Ice Co didn\u2019t have them, it bought up the companies that did (most notably Polarcube, in 1997, which unlocked the coveted Asda account). A move into a new facility in 2006 allowed the growing company to move its production line into the 21st century \u2013 ice is now escorted through it by robots, untouched by human hand \u2013 and to solve the perennial problem of cold storage. Ice, unsurprisingly, is a seasonal product, and the laborious task of building up enough stock to survive the summer begins months ahead of time.", "Then came an overextension: London. The capital proved inhospitable ground from the moment The Ice Co opened an office there in 2007: competition from Eskimo Ice (\u201cking of the cube in London\u201d, The Ice Co begrudgingly admits) and a slew of other brands was robust. \u201cIt was very, very difficult to keep control of,\u201d Metcalfe said: \u201cThere was no loyalty.\u201d When The Ice Co entered London, ice was \u00a37 per 12kg bag. Seven years later, it was \u00a33.50. This price pressure, combined with the highly fragmented nature of the local market \u2013 dozens if not hundreds of individual businesses, as opposed to a handful of national retailers \u2013 proved too much of a challenge, and The Ice Co closed its London office in 2014.", "By this point, though, there were other, more promising signals that things had started to change. To call what happened in the years following 2007\u2019s Great Recession the \u201cBritish Ice Boom\u201d is only overselling it insomuch as our consumption of ice still lags way behind the US. But it would be entirely fair to say that, in the UK, ice was finally starting to get cool.", "When the American author Matt Yglesias ignited a Twitter firestorm by referring to Europe as \u201ca continent where they don\u2019t have ice cubes\u201d in September this year, he was in fact far from the first American to note the dearth of ice in continental beverages. In Notes from a Big Country (published 1998), Bill Bryson wrote about the various culture shocks he experienced after returning to the US after decades spent in the UK, chief among them \u201cthe staunch conviction that ice is not a luxury item\u201d. And in his 2001 New Yorker profile of the ice magnate James Stuart, \u201cThe Emperor of Ice\u201d, Ian Parker would compare the US\u2019s voracious demand for ice to that of Europe, a region \u201cstuck at an earlier stage of development\u201d, citing the British capital as ground zero of ice parsimoniousness (\u201cFew things are more amusing to an American iceman than a gin-and-tonic in a London pub: the grudging tongs, the single cube\u201d).", "Britain took its first tentative steps towards ice enlightenment at the turn of the millennium. In an echo of how ice had reinvigorated American cocktail culture in the early 20th century, leading to the creation of whole categories of drinks \u2013 juleps, smashes, cobblers \u2013 British marketing teams began to realise abundant ice\u2019s potential as a means of altering customers\u2019 perceptions about a product, and ice emerged as the central component of several hugely popular campaigns.", "The first was Magners, the Irish cider brand that would come to dominate pub beer gardens during the World Cup summer of 2006. The accompanying advertising campaign would be credited by trade publications for almost single-handedly revitalising the ailing cider industry, rehabilitating its public perception as a \u201ccheap intoxicant\u201d and transforming it, as described in these pages, into \u201cthe new chardonnay\u201d.", "Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning", "The secret \u2013 as anyone unable to forget the clink-and-hiss sound effect that concluded Magners\u2019s sun-dappled TV spot will attest \u2013 was ice, and lots of it. The campaign struck a chord with consumers, and other brands raced to introduce their own ice-led offerings. In 2010, seeking to find an audience for its new crushed ice product, The Ice Co twinned with Bacardi Limited on a series of campaigns featuring brand names such as Bombay Sapphire, Martini and Bacardi on its ice bags, accompanied by a photo of an appealing-looking cocktail heavy on the ice \u2013 an education drive intended to teach consumers how to make the perfect cocktail to serve at home.", "In 2011, Mo\u00ebt Hennessey attempted to replicate the Magners magic with Mo\u00ebt Ice Imp\u00e9rial, \u201cthe first champagne specifically designed to be served over ice\u201d. The ice-cubes-in-wine trend would reach its logical conclusion five years later with the popularisation of fros\u00e9, essentially a ros\u00e9 wine-flavoured Slush Puppy. More recently, the staggering success of the Aperol spritz has been explained by its Instagrammable bright orange colour and sophisticated aperitivo-culture heritage. But those investigating the trend might also note that unlike one of its ingredients \u2013 that millennials\u2019 favourite, prosecco \u2013 the spritz is always served on the rocks.", "All these campaigns raised the public\u2019s expectations of drinking outside the home. Pubs that might once have doled out a miserly single cube now had to shovel pint glasses full to the brim; the distinctive sound of ice chinking on glassware or rattling in plastic party cups became the soundtrack of the British summer. Within The Ice Co, they call it \u201cthe clink effect\u201d: the power of ice to stir a host of associations within the consumer, all of them uplifting and positive.", "In parallel to this democratisation of ice, a new wave of cocktail bars had started to focus on ice as a key component of their offering. In Liquid Intelligence \u2013 the bible of modern cocktail culture \u2013 Dave Arnold dedicates a whole chapter to the subject, coaching his readers on the science and technology of making and using the sort of high-quality ice that \u201cwas the norm in the days before mechanical refrigeration\u201d. Bars increasingly put this sort of ice front and centre: when The Aviary opened in Chicago in 2011, it did so with a promotional video that showcased 25 individual types of ice in different shapes, sizes and flavours \u2013 from tiny pearls to cricket-ball-sized shells (as used in the classic, much-imitated \u201cIn The Rocks\u201d, in which the cocktail is served inside an ice cube that the drinker shatters at the table) \u2013 made on-site in a dedicated ice room by a dedicated ice guy. This new \u201ccraft ice\u201d even looked different: crystalline, \u201cwater-clear\u201d in Arnold\u2019s formulation, carved (in the fanciest bars) or shaved into exquisite shapes. The cloudy, brittle cubes lurking in the nation\u2019s freezer drawers were exposed as the abominations people in the trade had always thought them to be.", "As the author and spirits expert Emma Stokes told me over email, the craft cocktail movement also helped to foster a growing awareness that \u201cyou need a decent amount of ice to make good cocktails\u201d. Add insufficient ice to a drink and the ice will do what ice always seeks to do: melt into a watery mess. Add lots of ice, though, and the opposite happens: the drink remains cold and crisp. These were encouraging signs for the packaged ice business: if ice was supposed to be abundant, then a single domestic freezer tray or integrated fridge ice dispenser was no longer going to meet demand.", "Within the space of a few years, ice in the UK had started to matter, both in quantity and quality; people were even starting to display signs of ice snobbery. Within the trade, of course, they have always heaped derision on inferior product: Camper English, perhaps the pre-eminent cocktail ice scholar, refers to \u201cshitty hotel ice\u201d in contrast to proper, craft stuff; in The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, David Embury warns against making ice at home, lest your fridge-freezer introduce unwanted notes of \u201ccamembert cheese or leftover broccoli\u201d. But a giant piece of market research commissioned by The Ice Co in 2014 revealed that the average consumer, too, had an opinion: increasingly, people wanted different kinds of ice depending on how that ice was going to be used \u2013 whether to pack into a cocktail shaker, chill an ice bucket, or melt decorously and imperceptibly in a dram of single malt.", "A marketing strategy that could be crudely summarised as \u201chope for a hot summer\u201d had served The Ice Co perfectly well for decades. But in a market with informed and discerning consumers, sitting back and relying on a nationwide distribution strategy that got identical 2kg bags containing identical cubes in front of more shoppers than anyone else in the market was not going to be enough.", "Keeping tabs on what the market wants isn\u2019t always a hardship for The Ice Co, as Polly Metcalfe admitted: \u201cWe\u2019re quite a young group \u2013 we all enjoy drinking.\u201d The enjoyment of an occasional drink \u2013 and the ice within it \u2013 flows through the culture of The Ice Co. Unlimited free ice is a perk granted to all employees, a reminder that abundant ice is the best kind of ice. Employees have been known to quiz bartenders on where they get their ice (\u201cnone of us have pulled this way\u201d, admitted Ginny Woolhouse, the company\u2019s head of marketing). It is not unusual for team members on holiday to send photos of their drinks to the group WhatsApp, soliciting feedback on ice purity, quality, size.", "The ice from most holiday destinations visited by the team in the early 2010s looked more or less like Ice Co ice: domed cylinders, a little jagged at the edges, with a hole at the centre. The ice from Spain, though, was different \u2013 \u201csupersized cubes, really premium, like nothing we\u2019d ever seen before\u201d, recalled Woolhouse.", "Mass-market packaged ice (the stuff that goes into Party Ice bags) is formed in supercooled cylinders that are then broken down into smaller chunks; a high-speed, high-yield process that prioritises quantity over quality. But The Ice Co also already possessed a small number of Italian-made Scotsman machines, which worked in a totally different fashion, by spraying water upwards into an inverted mould. In a Scotsman, gravity ensures that any sediment or impurities in the water fall out of the finished cube, resulting in a noticeably superior product. By passing pure spring water into a Scotsman, The Ice Co hoped it could produce a dead ringer for the cubes served in Spain. The result was glassy, massy and dense. They called it the Super Cube.", "The Super Cube is aptly named: it is an absolute unit, at least three times larger than a conventional cube. And the ebullient explosion of the Spanish-style gin-tonic, served in a copa glass the size of a goldfish bowl filled to the brim with ice, represented a clear opportunity. The Super Cube was a natural companion to the tsunami of premium gins and tonics hitting the market as a trend became a craze in the 2010s. Today, The Ice Co is the official partner of both The Gin to My Tonic (the UK\u2019s largest gin-centric events business, with dozens of festivals in cities across the UK per year) and Craft Gin Club, the UK\u2019s No 1 gin subscription service, which sends its 75,000 members a bottle of craft gin plus tonic, garnishes and snacks every month (ice is not included, though the Super Cube\u2019s distinctive profile is everywhere on their website).", "The epochal significance of the Super Cube should not be overlooked in an industry in which meaningful innovation has typically been considered close to impossible. As the explosion in bottled water brands in the past few decades has shown, it is possible to persuade consumers of the need to buy something that they could quite easily obtain for themselves out of a tap. But ice\u2019s main job is to be cold \u2013 in most applications, a distinctive taste would be a flaw \u2013 and so The Ice Co has had to work harder than any water brand to diversify.", "Pressure from retailers to come up with the next big thing in ice is constant. Within The Ice Co this has resulted in some ideas perhaps best left at the bar. There were ice shot glasses (the product of a J\u00e4gerbomb-fuelled brainstorming session; \u201cvery, very gimmicky\u201d, admitted Metcalfe). There was the Ice & Easy brand of slushie cocktails \u2013 margaritas, mojitos, daiquiris, pi\u00f1a coladas \u2013 that arrived in a ready-to-pour freezer pouch. There were Ice & Slice mixed bags of ice and sliced lemon or lime (\u201claunched too early\u201d, admitted Woolhouse). There has even been talk of glitter-infused ice, and iced baubles \u2013 although, at the time of writing, neither of those has made it past the product development triage process.", "Whatever The Ice Co is selling, there remains the tricky question of how to sell it. In the US, the approach to marketing packaged ice revolves around a single idea: fear. Visit the International Packaged Ice Association\u2019s website today and the same slogan blares out from the homepage header as it has for years: \u201cICE IS FOOD!\u201d This central marketing message, that ice is a \u201cforgotten food\u201d, as susceptible to contaminants as meat or fresh vegetables, communicates the one clear advantage of packaged ice: the manufacturer\u2019s control over the conditions in which it is made.", "The Ice Co\u2019s strategy has been different. The product in question is undeniably cold \u2013 temperatures in The Ice Co\u2019s factory hover around 4-5C, and in cold storage they plummet to -20C \u2013 but ice is not without its warmer associations. Ice means weddings and parties and festivals or even something as simple but delightful as that first drink at the end of a long day. In Woolhouse\u2019s words: \u201cIt\u2019s not just frozen water, you\u2019re not buying ice \u2013 you\u2019re buying that occasion. That\u2019s what you\u2019re buying into \u2013 what would a party be without ice?\u201d", "As heartwarming as the sentiment may be, the Covid-19 pandemic has raised a different question: what would ice be without a party? What should have been a banner year for The Ice Co has instead forced it to refocus, and work out how best to plot a course through a new set of obstacles. A quirk of water is that it expands as it freezes, meaning that ice is capable of breaching even the most concerted attempts to confine it. Is 2020 the year that ice escapes The Ice Co\u2019s grasp?", "Ice is not a monolith. It encompasses everything from the giant iceberg that sank the Titanic \u2013 \u201cthe most famous piece of ice in the history of the world,\u201d as the writer Mariana Gosnell observed \u2013 to the millimetre-thin stuff you find at the edges of ponds and puddles, also known as \u201ccat ice\u201d \u2013 ice so thin that it could support the weight of a cat, but nothing heavier. Ice is at once a byword for permanence and something whose evanescence is essential to how we use it.", "For something so apparently simple, it can be fiendishly complex. The science of ice is maddening, and features phenomena such as the Mpemba effect, in which hot water appears to freeze faster than cold. Ice is maddening, in fact; anyone selling it for a living fights a constant battle against the laws of thermodynamics and the basic tenets of common sense, filling their freezer in the winter and clearing it out just as the weather starts to get hot. Elizabeth David writes of early importers desperately pleading with port authorities about the amount of duty payable on a cargo that was visibly diminishing in size. Perhaps the most successful ice-man of the 20th century, James Stuart, abandoned his empire for unspecified personal reasons just months after Ian Parker had profiled him in the New Yorker. Even Frederic Tudor, the 19th century Boston Ice King, spent time in prison on several occasions, having been rendered bankrupt by his obsession. With ice, crisis is a constant, a looming threat and fatal flaw inherent to every cube.", "So now Brexit looms \u2013 bad news for a business that exports products to the continent in temperature-controlled lorries \u2013 and Covid-19 drags on. The usual, virtual attempts have been made to keep morale high at The Ice Co during the pandemic \u2013 Friday afternoons see the doors open to The Ice-Olation Station, an online pub \u2013 but the apocalyptic subtext of the EPIA\u2019s newsletter from March this year \u2013 which promised \u201cthe certainty of a significant decline in packaged ice sales for this coming peak ice sales season\u201d \u2013 was unignorable. Now the packaged ice industry faces a Christmas period that will feature fewer parties and, one can safely assume, less Party Ice.", "But it is further in the future that ice\u2019s real reckoning awaits. The Ice Co\u2019s management team talked in rapturous tones about the long, hot summer of 2018: the year the ice almost ran out, when a full lorry was dispatched from the factory every 30 minutes, round the clock, for weeks on end. And yet selling ice in a world that\u2019s demonstrably heating up presents both an opportunity and an ethical dilemma. From the hack-it-off-a-glacier days up to the present, ice has always been about mankind\u2019s relationship with the environment. Even if the industry is no longer so obviously extractive, it still leaves a sizeable carbon footprint.", "If this is something that The Ice Co has taken proactive steps to address \u2013 all its ice is now made using green energy, all packaging is 100% recyclable and plastic use has been reduced 40% in the past two years \u2013 other events in the industry remain beyond their control. Competitors\u2019 attempts at market consolidation are a constant risk. In 2018, the private equity-backed Procubitos Europe group was formed out of a merger between the two largest packaged-ice manufacturers in Spain; after adding the largest Italian player, Polo Nord, to the portfolio, the group now owns packaged ice in Germany, too, right on the fringes of The Ice Co\u2019s dominion.", "Consumer tastes remain fickle: following the gin-and-tonic boom, there is now talk of the non-alcoholic spirits explosion, the dawn of tequila and soda, the emerging craft rum supremacy. The specifics of these trends are meaningless.
