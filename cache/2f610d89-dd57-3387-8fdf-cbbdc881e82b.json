During E3, producer Junichi Masuda explained that not every Pok\u00e9mon will make the leap into Sword and Shield. This news left many fans disappointed, so I caught up with Masuda during our trip for this month's cover story to dive deeper into the reasoning for the cuts.", "According to Masuda, the sheer number of Pok\u00e9mon the series had accumulated over the last two-plus decades got to the point of being unwieldy. \"Up until now, we\u2019ve been proud we\u2019ve been able to include so many Pok\u00e9mon in the games, but as a result of that, there\u2019s actually been quite a few features or gameplay ideas that we\u2019ve had to abandon in the past,\" he says. \"Going forward, thinking about the future of Pok\u00e9mon, we want to prioritize all those new gameplay ideas, new ways to enjoy the game, and want to challenge ourselves at Game Freak to create new ways to enjoy the game. That\u2019s really what drove the decision for this new direction.\"", "The decision was the result of collaborative talks between Game Freak, The Pok\u00e9mon Company, and Nintendo. \"We have a lot of awesome new challenges that we haven\u2019t even revealed in Sword and Shield,\" Masuda says. \"We want to continue to come up with these new features, so we figured this was the best path forward for the franchise\"", "Things are a bit complicated when diving into how the team decided which Pok\u00e9mon wouldn't carry over into the Galar region. \"A wide variety of discussions happened; it\u2019s not just one kind of criteria for deciding which Pok\u00e9mon are going to appear in the games, but a lot of different reasons, a lot of different directions, a lot of debate over which ones would be the best in the game,\" Masuda says. \"I think one example of that is figuring out the Pok\u00e9mon that would make sense for the setting of the game the most; these Pok\u00e9mon look like they could live in the Galar region. We really spent a lot of effort deciding which would best fit the setting of the adventure and the features that we wanted to implement. I think players will be satisfied. There\u2019s quite a few Pok\u00e9mon that you\u2019ll encounter in the Galar region Pok\u00e9dex, so I think players will have fun seeing all the Pok\u00e9mon.\"", "When I ask for specifics about the Pok\u00e9mon that didn't make the cut for Sword and Shield \u2013 including names and total number of creatures \u2013 Masuda did not elaborate. However, he was much more explicit when I asked if cut Pok\u00e9mon will return in future games. \"Definitely,\" he says. \"You can look forward to seeing Pok\u00e9mon that don\u2019t appear in these games appearing in different regions in future games. I think Pok\u00e9mon Home, for a lot of players, will serve as a launching pad to gather them all there and then embark on future adventures.\"", "Pok\u00e9mon Home has been announced, but details to this point are scarce. Masuda intends on keeping it that way for a bit longer, but he did offer a bit more insight into the upcoming app. \"We\u2019re really designing it as the place for all of your Pok\u00e9mon together, so it\u2019s really important for the future of the franchise, and it\u2019ll be more than even Pok\u00e9mon Bank as a place to gather all your Pok\u00e9mon together in one spot.\"", "We'll have to see which Pok\u00e9mon we encounter in the Galar region when Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield launch November 15.", "For more on Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, head to our hub by clicking the banner below."]}
