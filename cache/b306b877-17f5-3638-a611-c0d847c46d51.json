It is a sham,\u201d said Marcio Astrini, executive director of the Climate Observatory, an umbrella group of environmental NGOs.", "Brazil\u2019s vice-president, Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, who hosted the tour and heads the government\u2019s Amazon council, said seeing the effects of Amazon deforestation and fires close up was \u201cnot necessary\u201d.", "Analysts said the tour was a sop to European governments wavering on ratifying a trade deal between the EU and the South American trade block Mercosur. Amazon deforestation and fires have accelerated since Jair Bolsonaro took office as Brazil\u2019s president in January 2019 with an anti-environmental agenda, promising to develop the region.", "\u201cGovernments in favour of ratification want Brazil to do things like that in order to help them to make a case \u2026 back in their capitals,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a S\u00e3o Paulo business school.", "Others feared they had fallen into a propaganda trap as an official government Twitter account falsely tweeted that Brazil protected its environment more than anywhere else, and Bolsonaro\u2019s claim that \u201cshady interests\u201d coveted Amazon riches. Many of the claims were debunked by the environmental factchecking site fakebook.eco.", "First mooted by Bolsonaro a year ago and organised after eight European countries, including the UK, in September urged Brazil to take \u201creal action\u201d over deforestation, the trip concentrated on the Amazon city of Manaus and the rainforest\u2019s better protected northern region.", "It included a zoo, a deforestation monitoring centre, a sustainable farm and the confluence of the Amazon and Negro rivers near Manaus, a major tourist point. On Friday, ambassadors visited a military base in the Yanomami indigenous reserve and an indigenous health centre in the remote town of S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira.", "Greenpeace delivered an alternative route to ambassadors taking part before the trip began, suggesting they visit devastated areas such as the Jamanxim forest in Par\u00e1 state. \u201cI hope the ambassadors clearly understand this is nothing more than media propaganda that does not represent reality,\u201d said Cristiane Mazzetti, an Amazon campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil.", "Before setting off, the UK\u2019s acting ambassador in Brazil, Liz Davidson, tweeted that \u201cit is a shame the trip does not include visits to areas more impacted by environmental degradation\u201d. She told Brazil\u2019s Valor Econ\u00f4mico daily that the UK wanted to see a long-term plan to combat illegal deforestation.", "In a last minute deviation from the official route, the ambassadors were due to fly over the BR-163 highway in Par\u00e1 \u2013 the region suggested by Greenpeace \u2013 which cuts through heavily deforested Amazon forest, the G1 site reported. There were no plans to land.", "\u201cWe looked to fly over the BR-163 region \u2026 we weren\u2019t able to because there was cloud cover in spite of flying low, but it is important to make clear that taking them in loco is not really necessary,\u201d Mour\u00e3o told reporters in Manaus, according to the city\u2019s A Critica site. He heads an army operation to combat fires and deforestation widely derided as ineffective.", "Bolsonaro\u2019s government has dismantled environmental protections. Environmental officials have been sacked, banned from talking to the media and forbidden to burn and destroy tractors and other equipment used by illegal loggers and miners. Deforestation hit a 10-year high between August 2018 and July 2019, reaching 10,129 sq kms, and indications are that the next figures, due next month, will be even higher.", "Fires in the Amazon also hit a 10-year high, rising 13% in the first nine months of 2020. Bolsonaro falsely claimed in a speech to the United Nations that the rainforest did not burn, blaming indigenous people and a \u201cdisinformation campaign anchored on shady interests\u201d for negative media coverage. In April the environment minister, Ricardo Salles \u2013 who was also on this week\u2019s trip \u2013 called for more deregulation while media was distracted by the Covid-19 pandemic.", "On Friday the Climate Observatory said Brazil\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 9.6% in 2019. It said 2.2bn tons of carbon dioxide was released, driven by Amazon deforestation and making it impossible for Brazil to meet its 2020 emissions target."], "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "keywords": ["sham", "brazil", "media", "indigenous", "tour", "environmental", "trip", "deforestation", "groups", "ambassadors", "denounce", "foreign", "amazon", "site", "green", "brazils", "diplomats"], "pubDate": "2020-11-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
