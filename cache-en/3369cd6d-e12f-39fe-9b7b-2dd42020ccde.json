With the most recent concept art revealing what looks to be Dragon Age Origins' Zevran making a return with his silver-laden armor, and the most recent short seen on Dragon Age Day, it's no wonder why all eyes are on what's next for our favorite ex-crow.

The call to elf-loving arms began when Curry teased a new project on Dragon Age game on Twitter, saying \"Just found out I'm going to be voicing an awesome new character soon. Stay tuned! Super exciting.\"", "Immediately, fans responded with Zevran questions, to which he replied \"I sure wish they'd bring Zevran back!! Can someone start a letter-writing campaign? Wow, how old fashioned was that statement???\"", "In our analysis of the Mortalitasi and its role with Dragon Age 4, the possibility of Zevran's return is actually a lot higher than many might think, especially given that it looks like we may have a Mortalitasi companion. Given that this necromancy-focused group of high-ranking mages are the Nevarran elite and have deep roots with Antiva and Tevinter alike, it looks like Solas' betrayal may be the least of our concerns.", "While not Zevran-related news, we do at least have the confirmation that we'll see something new about Dragon Age 4 this week with the Game Awards 2020 showcase this Thursday. We don't know if that's more concept art or a teaser trailer like two years ago, but it will be interesting to see what BioWare has to show on the heels of the news that Mark Darrah and Casey Hudson are departing the company.", "Are you hoping to see Zevran return for Dragon Age 4?
