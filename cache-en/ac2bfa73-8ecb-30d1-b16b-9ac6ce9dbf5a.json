A meeting last Friday between farmers and the government went on for seven hours but failed to end the deadlock.", "The prime minister, Narendra Modi, passed the laws in September, saying they would reform an archaic and outdated system and give farmers more control over their crop prices. However farmers began protesting, saying they had not been consulted and that their livelihoods face ruin.", "Agriculture employs more than 40% of India\u2019s workforce but it is also an industry plagued by poverty, underdevelopment and suffering. India has one of the highest rates of farmer suicides in the world.", "Over 450 farmer\u2019s unions and organisations supported the nationwide strike on Tuesday, which saw police deployed across the country to keep the agitation under control.", "Stationed at the Delhi border was Kuldip Malana, 41, a farmer from Bant district in Haryana, who has been travelling back every evening to pick up food supplies and bring back home anyone who has fallen sick at the protests.", "\u201cOver the last 25 years, farmers have suffered and the government has not bothered about us, even when so many are committing suicide,\u201d said Malana. \u201cThey have not provided cold storage for our crops to keep them fresh, so sometimes we have to sell our vegetables for 1 rupee. They have not give us enough water for our crops.\u201d", "He added: \u201cThey have not thought about us for years, and suddenly they come up with reforms have nothing to do with helping the farmers and only benefit the big corporations. These laws are suicide for us all.\u201d", "Malana and other farmers proclaimed the strike a success, after the home minister, Amit Shah, agreed to meet with the farmers\u2019 leaders at his residence at 7pm on Tuesday. \u201cThere is no midway. We will demand just \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 from the home minister at today\u2019s meeting,\u201d Rudru Singh Mansa, a farmers\u2019 leader, told reporters. Farmers are also due to have a meeting with the government on Wednesday to continue discussions.", "Political tensions also escalated around the protests.
