If the symbol of the 2000 race was the hanging chad, and 2008\u2019s was the \u201cHope\u201d poster, 2020\u2019s may be the boarded-up storefront. Before the votes came in, the smart money among the business class was on destruction, whether in celebration or in protest. Or maybe both. In Manhattan, as Tuesday approached, entire blocks were shuttered.", "Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "This made Tom Buiocchi an impor\u00adtant figure. In normal times, his company, ServiceChannel, helps businesses such as Chipotle and Tory Burch find contractors to do work on their \u00adbuildings. \u201cThe common problem is, you know, the toilet blew up in the bathroom of the Banana Republic in Walla Walla, Washington,\u201d he said. Recently, however, he\u2019s become a consigliere to companies nervous about election unrest. In the two weeks leading up to Election Day, Service\u00adChannel helped put up plywood and other looting deterrents at twelve hundred buildings. Two hundred and twenty-\u00adnine of them were in New York.", "The decision to lock down can be tricky. \u201cBeing the first to board up, or the only one that didn\u2019t board up, could be perceived that you\u2019re siding with some particular stance,\u201d Buiocchi said. During the scattered looting after the murder of George Floyd, this spring, some companies were slow to respond. At one of the stores Buiocchi services in the Bay Area, he said, \u201cthings were being boarded up as the protesters were coming by. There was literally a negotiation between the contractors and the protesters.\u201d Before the election, owners exchanged tips. Looters had started bringing drills to unscrew the plywood, so owners learned to use screws with unusually shaped heads. They added corrugated metal. The deep-pocketed switched to plywood that was fire resistant. Strategies were devised to prevent the spillage of blood. (\u201cBiohazard,\u201d Buiocchi explained. \u201cIt elongates the amount of time you have to stay closed.\u201d) One new approach involved pleas for peace painted directly onto the plywood. In SoHo, someone had scrawled a quote from the Dalai Lama on the Jimmy Choo boutique. A Ralph Lauren store nearby had one from Ronald Reagan. A saboteur, perhaps? (\u201cBorderline insurance fraud,\u201d someone called it.) \u201cWhat the stores have learned never to do is to put up merchandising and brand-specific information like, \u2018Hey! Two-for-one sale today!\u2019 \u201d Buiocchi explained.", "The best outcome, business-wise, was a resounding victory for either candidate. \u201cClear, decisive, everybody go back to work in twenty-four hours,\u201d Buiocchi said. By Wednesday, he was ruling out that dream scenario. Yet for the next two nights only small protests materialized in the city. Calm\u2014or exhaustion\u2014mostly prevailed.", "All the plywood began to imply a diminished faith in self-government. It also, in a way, conveyed confidence in a product. The boarded-up Versace store reinforced the idea that lots of people want Versace. But there were limits. The Sweetgreen near Union Square was boarded up; was it worried that citizens would make a run on Shroomami bowls? \u201cThe reason is, sometimes people just want to throw a garbage can through a window, and if they damage equipment it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d a contractor, whose company had shuttered a bakery last week, explained.", "For those most pessimistic about the long-term stability of the body public, the best option was something permanent but not panicky. In the weeks before the election, Riot Glass, a company offering shatterproof reinforcement for windows and doors, got more orders than it could keep up with. Brad Campbell, the C.E.O., invented the product six years ago, on a hunch: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that there was some sort of imminent chaos coming.\u201d His product has survived sledgehammers and worse\u2014\u201cwe\u2019ve shot it with AK-47 rounds,\u201d he said, and still no shattering\u2014but it\u2019s also unobtrusive. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make their building look like an armed camp,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to look fortified, but they want to be fortified.\u201d", "By the week\u2019s end, as the vote counts trickled in and a conclusion neared, the peace was holding across the country, but barely. Armed right-wing protesters were massing outside a ballot-counting center in Maricopa County, in Arizona. The N.Y.P.D. was roughing up an elected official. Trump\u2019s campaign was urging his followers to \u201cFIGHT BACK.\u201d (Some seemed to be heeding the advice: police in Philadelphia said they foiled a planned attack outside the city\u2019s election center.) But big business was sanguine. Stocks shot up, likely at the prospect of a Republican Senate with a Biden White House\u2014the same friendly tax rates, without the pesky tweets. But where to spend the extra dough? A spokesman for Tiffany\u2019s pointed out that its store near Trump Tower, despite being covered in plywood, was still open for business. \u2666"], "authors": ["Zach Helfand", "Zach Helfan"], "keywords": ["buiocchi", "protesters", "work", "results", "plywood", "weeks", "city", "store", "awaiting", "company", "product", "york", "business", "election", "voting"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
