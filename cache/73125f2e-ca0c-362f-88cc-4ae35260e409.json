Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Health and Human Services Department, at a conference on stimulant abuse on Monday. \u201cWithin a few short months, and you can model it any way you want, methamphetamines will be secondary to fentanyl nationwide associated with overdose deaths.\u201d", "Unlike with opioids, there is no way to reverse the effects of a meth overdose, just as there is no medication approved to treat meth addiction and the cravings it creates. For now, treatment for meth addiction consists largely of behavioral therapies with \u201ca much more moderate effect size compared with medication,\u201d said Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.", "For many here in Oklahoma, what treatments do exist are out of reach. Most poor adults in the state do not qualify for Medicaid coverage that would help those with meth addiction gain access to treatment, because the state has chosen not to expand the program under the Affordable Care Act. And while Oklahoma has won a windfall of money \u2014 $355 million \u2014 from lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, much of it is specifically for fighting opioid addiction.", "\u201cWe know there is funding coming in for the opioid problem,\u201d said Mimi Tarrasch, the chief officer of Women in Recovery, an alternative sentencing program in Tulsa. \u201cBut what I see, and what our community continues to see, is really a lot of addiction to methamphetamine.\u201d"]}
