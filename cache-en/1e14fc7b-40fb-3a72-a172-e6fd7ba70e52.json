Songs that might have fuelled a festival crowd or spilled out of car windows simply couldn\u2019t be experienced in the old way. A few of those songs took on new meaning during a summer of protests, others migrated to social platforms such as TikTok; some artists reimagined the live show for virtual audiences, but music remained at a cool distance. Often, it\u2019s only after a song is heard live, in the open, at a barbecue, buzzed in the back seat of a cab, or when someone bombs at karaoke that it clicks into place and unlocks an artist. So much of the best music is truly revealed in motion\u2014that is how music becomes the lifeblood that animates our days.", "2020 in Review New Yorker writers reflect on the year\u2019s highs and lows.", "When I think about the best music of 2020, I think first of the album, a medium that\u2019s nearly at odds with streaming\u2019s playlisting model yet one that deeply rewards close listening during a time of unprecedented idleness. I think second about context: which albums helped us navigate a lost plague year and which albums will transcend it? Or, rather, what music will forever be \u201cpandemic music,\u201d and what music will carry over with the best music of other years into the great historical record? That kind of forecasting is always an inexact science, but this year it feels even more like bone-casting. Who\u2019s to say what music might suddenly resonate with many of us whenever we\u2019ve finally awakened from a pandemic-induced fugue state? Listening to new music is hard, and it was harder still under distress. It is much easier to return to the familiar in a time of crisis. I was grateful for the chance to vote for Rolling Stone\u2019s \u201c500 Greatest Albums of All Time\u201d this summer, because it gave me a reason to retreat into music I already cherished\u2014music that had already revealed itself to me and could act as a salve amid uncertainty.", "Year-end lists are, more or less, about accumulation\u2014the things that imprint upon us in the course of the given period. In 2020, it was difficult to feel connected to things, and, therefore, tougher than ever to do the requisite stockpiling and auditing required to make a truly thorough accounting of \u201cbests.\u201d Even so, there will always be music that manages to break through the fog, that grabs hold and shakes you and refuses to let you free of its grasp. These are the albums that stuck with me despite everything.", "The Microphones, \u201cMicrophones in 2020\u201d", "The singer and multi-instrumentalist Phil Elverum yearns to understand the impulses that produced the heady music of his youth. \u201cMicrophones in 2020,\u201d a return to his old Microphones moniker, after seventeen years as Mount Eerie, is a steady, gripping consideration of process, form, and identity\u2014an undulating forty-five-minute guitar composition that surges and crashes against his recollections as a career indie musician. These are the naked, gorgeous musings of an introspective artist lost in thought.", "Fiona Apple, \u201cFetch the Bolt Cutters\u201d", "Recorded in Apple\u2019s Venice Beach home, with her piano and her dog, \u201cFetch the Bolt Cutters\u201d is about as organic and uninhibited as music gets. Constructed entirely out of sounds around the artist and composed entirely of biting lyrics that challenge any attempts to silence her, it\u2019s an album made of jagged edges. Apple\u2019s songs are intensely personal yet powerfully transparent. Clattering and cluttered but clearheaded and deliberate, this brilliant, brutal, unprecedented work feels like a transcendent artist assembling a new form of music from scratch.", "Phoebe Bridgers, \u201cPunisher\u201d", "The sophomore album of the twenty-six-year-old folk-rock musician Phoebe Bridgers is spectral and internal\u2014a haunted, radiant collection of songs about managing personal turmoil in the periphery of a wider crisis. Her muted singing lends her songs about searching for feeling even greater depth. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing dead my whole life,\u201d she sings on \u201cICU,\u201d and, throughout the album, she seeks to reverse course and become alive again. Her sincere, almost blunt manner of writing is rich in its specificity, and there is a constant sense of resiliency in her sad songs, in which she never stops moving.", "Moses Sumney, \u201cgr\u00e6\u201d", "A Californian born to Ghanian parents, Moses Sumney has often obsessed over division and betweenness. His sumptuous, two-part album \u201cgr\u00e6\u201d delves further into this duality of being, exploring statelessness and displacement. These songs are about uncovering the self amid feelings of isolation and detachment, eventually settling in a space beyond definition or classification. The music is just as fluid\u2014owing to a diverse host of collaborators such as Daniel Lopatin, Thundercat, James Blake, Tom Gallo, Jill Scott, Adult Jazz, and more\u2014and spans every genre from indie rock and folk to electro soul and pop. But it\u2019s Sumney\u2019s overarching vision and cutting falsettos that give the album shape, texture, and dimension.", "Bob Dylan, \u201cRough and Rowdy Ways\u201d"], "authors": ["Sheldon Pearce", "Sheldon Pearc", "Margaret Talbo"], "keywords": ["music", "unprecedented", "favorite", "album", "microphones", "songs", "2020", "albums", "artist", "think", "best", "thirty"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
