Photographed by Greg Kadel, Vogue, September 2003", "Last night, friends and family gathered at the Baryshnikov Arts Center in Manhattan to celebrate the life and career of designer Isabel Toledo. Toledo\u2019s death from breast cancer on August 26 came as a shock to the international fashion community who regarded her as a legendary figure for her sense of craft and aesthetic rigor, and her possession of that rare magic that elevates a designer from mere trendsetter to something more timeless.", "The speakers, who included Wendy Goodman, James Kaliardos, and Kim Hastreiter, all spoke of Toledo\u2019s achievements in fashion, and her deft ability to transform even the most pedestrian of fabrics (plain cotton, raw denim, silk jersey) into fluid architectural wonders. Others spoke of the significance of her accomplishments as a woman of color: a Cuban immigrant who went on to show in Paris, become the subject of numerous museum exhibitions, and dress former First Lady Michelle Obama for the inauguration in 2008. There were performances by friends such as Joey Arias and the puppeteer Basil Twist. The evening concluded with a letter to Isabel from her husband the artist Ruben Toledo, read aloud to a weeping audience by family friend Whoopi Goldberg. Every speaker had noted that Isabel\u2019s life was exemplary for two reasons: her innate design genius and the extraordinary, bottomless love that she had shown and known in her marriage to Ruben. Below is Ruben\u2019s letter to Isabel in its entirety.", "My Isabel Isabel,", "I love to say your name twice: It rings like a bell inside my head, so soothing and gentle and hopeful. You know how well we fit together\u2014like two misfit puzzle pieces that magically unite forever. Your mystical essence is still clinging to me like my second skin that feels so good. I remain wrapped up in your cocoon of warmth and kindness that took you 45 years to weave around us. I am protected in your meticulous folds and hidden pleats\u2014your scent still lingers inside my lining.", "We always trusted each others\u2019 moves and rhythms. How should I interpret your sudden turn and departure? Should I try to keep the same rhythm going\u2014keep the beat best as I can? Or should I fall into the offbeat unpredictable soulful conga drums that you love so much with their own ancient and solid vibrations?"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/isabel-toledo-memorial?mbid=social_onsite_pinterest", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["life", "inside", "toledo", "ruben", "love", "late", "toledos", "wife", "remembers", "letter", "friends", "designer", "beloved", "isabel", "spoke"], "id": "9fd97aa8-3191-3c62-9dfa-89ebb128b767", "title": "Ruben Toledo Remembers His Beloved Late Wife, Designer Isabel Toledo", "summary": "Isabel Toledo in 2003.\nPhotographed by Greg Kadel, Vogue, September 2003Last night, friends and family gathered at the Baryshnikov Arts Center in Manhattan to celebrate the life and career of designer Isabel Toledo.\nThe evening concluded with a letter to Isabel from her husband the artist Ruben Toledo, read aloud to a weeping audience by family friend Whoopi Goldberg.\nBelow is Ruben\u2019s letter to Isabel in its entirety.\nMy Isabel Isabel,I love to say your name twice: It rings like a bell inside my head, so soothing and gentle and hopeful.", "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Sally Singe"]}
