Spent grain is transformed into fuel, and carbon dioxide produced during fermentation will be used downstream to carbonate beer.", "Carbon neutral? Sounds like a revolution", "As more businesses and industries focus on reducing their carbon footprints, this could usher in a green industrial revolution, kickstarting a boom in the green jobs market. In agriculture alone, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that responding to the climate emergency will create 200m full-time jobs globally by 2050.", "What\u2019s a job worth? It\u2019s about more than money", "Searious Business, a Dutch company committed to preventing plastic pollution, has seen a sharp increase in job applications from \u201cpeople wanting a job with purpose\u201d, especially from generation Z. \u201cPolluting industries are having trouble attracting the right people to help them future-proof their business.

A 2018 International Labour Organization report estimated that 6m jobs could be created by adopting a more circular economy. Globally, 1.2bn jobs directly rely on a healthy environment \u2013 for example, fishing, farming and forestry \u2013 and environmental degradation and heat stress will threaten these jobs.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pod Point, a company that installs electric vehicle charging points, has benefited from funding from Triodos Bank", "When it comes to banking, why do green choices matter?", "Banks are all about investing, often that can be in fossil fuels and arms, but choosing to bank ethically boosts the green infrastructure across today\u2019s economy.

Watts believes that our current economic system is failing, and he is calling for a green recovery and asking the government to create new jobs that contribute to a climate-safe future.", "Where\u2019s the demand for green jobs?", "A recent Local Government Association report states that by 2030, 46% of low-carbon jobs will be in clean electricity generation and providing low-carbon heat for homes and businesses. The manufacture of electric vehicles is also an area of growth. Arrival, a London-based startup founded in 2015 that makes commercial EVs, achieved rare \u201cunicorn\u201d status earlier this year when it reached a market valuation of more than $1bn (\u00a3774m).

That\u2019s equivalent to eliminating all transport emissions globally. So better financing is crucial.", "Sustainability needs to be ingrained into the design stage across all sectors. One designer keen to use fewer products that last longer is Bernice Pan, founder of the sustainable fashion brand Deploy, which upcycles offcuts while avoiding overproduction and stock discarding. Pan, who leads a team of 10 and is currently seeking new staff, believes that creating green jobs goes far beyond employing people with new stand-alone roles such as \u201csustainability officer\u201d. \u201cAll jobs should be greener,\u201d says Pan.
