That is almost double the number in October 2019, when there were 340,220 northern claimants.", "But the government\u2019s \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to compensating affected areas takes no account of the fact the UK entered the global pandemic with deep, growing divides between and within England\u2019s regions caused by decades of centralisation and 10 years of austerity, IPPR North said.", "\u201cCovid-19 makes the challenge of reducing regional inequalities even greater than before \u2013 especially for a government whose election platform rested heavily on a promise to do just that. \u2018Levelling up\u2019 is the latest in a long history of initiatives that refer loosely to regional rebalancing \u2026 to date, however, it is also one of the most striking for its lack of detail on how rebalancing is to be achieved,\u201d the IPPR North\u2019s report says.", "A \u00a34bn levelling up fund for England was announced last month, to pay for \u201clocal infrastructure that has a visible impact on people and their communities\u201d.", "\u201cUnfortunately this will be a centrally administered fund, thereby missing an opportunity to strengthen devolution, build on the local knowledge and expertise of combined and local authorities,\u201d IPPR North says.", "Covid has affected the health, livelihoods and future prospects of people in different ways, depending on where they live. It has \u201ccreated new regional inequalities and deepened old divisions\u201d, the report adds.", "Of all the English regions, London has had the biggest year-on-year increase in unemployment benefit claimants, with an extra 302,910 people requiring support, a 5% rise. In Tottenham, the worst affected constituency, 12.5% of the population are on the dole, up 8.4% from last October. The south-west of England has seen on of the lowest annual percentage increases in joblessness, up 2.9% \u2013 the same as Wales and Scotland.", "But there are fewer job opportunities in the north compared with the rest of England, IIPR North found, with 0.7 jobs per person in the north, lower than the English average (0.74 jobs per person).", "In addition, median wages are lower in the north than England as a whole, with 5 million northern workers paid less than the real living wage.", "Gender and ethnicity pay gaps are also wider in the north than elsewhere in the UK, with 40% of northern English women paid less than the real living wage.", "Northern English workers are lower qualified than average, too, with just 37% having qualifications at NVQ level 4 (equivalent to a BTec professional award or certificate of higher education) or above, compared with 45% across England. Two per cent of the working age population in the north have no qualifications at all, impacting earnings and productivity in the region.", "Healthy life expectancy is also below the English average in the majority of northern areas and has even fallen in some places. Over the past decade, about one-third of local authority areas in the north recorded a fall in healthy life expectancy for men and just under 60% reported a fall for women.", "The director of IPPR North, Sarah Longlands said: \u201cOur regional divides are severe and growing, we face a climate emergency, and Brexit is just around the corner, so a recovery from Covid-19 that simply restores the status quo \u2013 which has failed so many northerners \u2013 would be unacceptable.", "\u201cWe need to challenge old, reductive assumptions about our economy because they\u2019ve failed to create the conditions for a good life for everyone in the north. In particular, we have to stop assuming that the centre knows best and commit once and for all to a clear programme of regional devolution in England. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past \u2026 This is a wake-up call. Is the government listening?\u201d", "An Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cRecovering from coronavirus is the biggest challenge the UK has faced in living memory and we can\u2019t shy away from the fact our national recovery will be difficult.
