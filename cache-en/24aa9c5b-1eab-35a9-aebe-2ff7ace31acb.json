You didn\u2019t do it then,\" said Grenell, who then asked Tapper point-blank: \"Were you instructed to ignore it until after the election?\"", "CNN did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.", "Grenell's question appears to be valid after recordings leaked by Project Veritas last week revealed that CNN President Jeff Zucker and Political Director David Chalian urged staff back in October not to cover the explosive New York Post report that shed light on Hunter Biden's shady business dealings overseas.", "\"Obviously, we're not going with the New York Post story right now on Hunter Biden,\" Chalian is heard saying during a conference call on Oct. 14, the same day the Post published its first Hunter Biden story.", "JAKE TAPPER DECLARES HUNTER BIDEN CLAIMS 'TOO DISGUSTING' TO REPEAT ON CNN: 'THE RIGHTWING IS GOING CRAZY'", "\"The Trump media, you know, moves immediately from -- OK, well, never mind -- the [Michael Flynn] unmasking was, you know, found to be completely nonsensical to the latest alleged scandal and expects everybody to just follow suit,\" Zucker told his staff on Oct. 16. \"So, I don't think that we should be repeating unsubstantiated smears just because the right-wing media suggests that we should.\"", "Chalian and Zucker's messages appeared to have later resonated with Tapper, who said Oct. 22 that the allegations against Biden's son were \"too disgusting\" to repeat on air and that the \"right wing is going crazy.\"", "However, since the election, Tapper has struck a vastly different tone when it comes to Hunter Biden's potential business conflicts. Last week, the CNN anchor even asked Joe Biden about it during an interview.", "CNN BOSS, POLITICAL DIRECTOR SPIKED HUNTER BIDEN CONTROVERSY, AUDIOTAPES REVEAL: 'WE'RE NOT GOING WITH' STORY", "\"When your son came under scrutiny during the campaign, you vowed 'No one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operations whatsoever. Period. End of story,'\" Tapper began. \"Will your brothers, will your son take leave from any business interests, not just foreign but any business interests, that might create any even an appearance of impropriety?\"", "\"My son, my family will not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict with an appropriate distance from the presidency and government,\" Biden responded.", "Tapper quickly moved on to another topic without any follow-up questions.", "On Twitter, however, Tapper scolded the Biden transition team over Wednesday's press release, apparently spoiling CNN's own reporting about the younger Biden's legal troubles in the process.", "\"CNN\u2019s @evanperez was working on the story about the US [sic] Attorney investigation and reached out to Hunter\u2019s legal team for comment Monday. They spoke on Tuesday and said they would get back to him today. They didn\u2019t. Instead the transition team issued a press release,\" Tapper tweeted.", "CNN BOSS RIPS 'USEFUL IDIOT' RUDY GIULIANI FOR PUSHING HUNTER BIDEN 'DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN,' AUDIOTAPE SHOWS", "He later wrote, \"Note to Biden transition team: if your strategy to deal with bad news is to falsely promise a comment to journalists operating in good faith then issue a press release, you will end up getting called late in the process.\"", "This isn't the first time the former acting DNI clashed with liberal jouranlist.
