They have a roster of authors that they call on, and this meant that I got to be on the list of people who got to pitch novels. And I ended up submitting a successful proposal for a novel for the Ravenloft line. \u2026 They ended up canceling the Ravenloft line before that book ever got written, so that was a huge heartbreak. I remember being devastated. I was in the Congo at the time. I knew it was going to be bad news, because I got an email from my agent saying, \u2018Can we talk?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I\u2019m in the Congo.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah, but can we talk?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh god, this is not going to be good news.'\u201d", "Erin Lindsey on networking:", "\u201cI was just such a neophyte about all of it. I remember, so distinctly, one of the only events that I went to. If it wasn\u2019t JABberwocky hosting it there were a lot of JABberwocky people there. Peter V. Brett was there, and Joshua [Bilmes] introduced us\u2014Joshua\u2019s also his agent. He introduced us, and he said, \u2018This is Erin, and she\u2019s got five books under contract, and she\u2019s living in Burundi right now.\u2019 And there was this look on Pete\u2019s face, and he said, \u2018You\u2019re going to do two books a year?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And you could see the struggle of him wanting to say \u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 but being too polite. And he was just like, \u2018Good. That\u2019s nice.\u2019 And I remember thinking right at that moment, \u2018Have I made a terrible mistake?'\u201d", "Erin Lindsey on marketing:", "\u201cMinotaur is a mystery publisher, not a spec-fic publisher. They are marketing this\u2014and have always marketed this\u2014as \u2018historical mystery with a dash of the supernatural.\u2019 So definitely in terms of the titles that have been chosen for the books, the cover treatments, all of that, it\u2019s very deliberately cueing for \u2018cozy historical mystery.\u2019 It\u2019s not an accident that that speculative element isn\u2019t front and center. \u2026 So the surprise element\u2014\u2019Surprise, there\u2019s a ghost!\u2019\u2014was definitely foreseen and deliberate. The gamble is that more people will be pleasantly surprised than unpleasantly surprised. It\u2019s always been, I confess\u2014and I hope it\u2019s not too transparent to say\u2014a bit of a nail-biter for me as a strategy.\u201d", "Erin Lindsey on history:", "\u201cAll three [Rose Gallagher books] started, in terms of plotting, with an actual historical event that sounded fishy, or cool, or like a good plot device. So for the first book, it\u2019s the blowing up of Flood Rock. There are small islands in the East River, between Queens and Manhattan, and in 1885 the Army Corps of Engineers decided to blow one up, to make it easier for ships to get by. It was, at the time, the largest explosion ever, and it shattered windows all the way across to the Hudson River. It was huge, and the newspapers made a great deal out of it. So you have this huge explosion in the East River in a place called \u2018Hell Gate,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Obviously that\u2019s a good place to start.'\u201d", "More Great WIRED Stories"], "authors": ["Geek'S Guide To The Galaxy", "Powered Outbrain", "Kayla Lacour", "Echo Esc_Html", "Wired_Get_The_Byline_Name", "Related_Video"], "keywords": ["character", "book", "good", "teddy", "roosevelt", "lindsey", "series", "historical", "basically", "going", "mystery", "fantasy", "books", "supernatural"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
