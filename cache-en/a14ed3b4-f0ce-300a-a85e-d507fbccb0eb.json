Twenty-four hours in the life of the rising star are surprisingly down to earth; no paparazzi strolls or wild escapades, just time spent enjoying the accomplishments of adulthood. \u201cIt\u2019s a very typical Tuesday,\u201d says Ferreira as she prepares her morning cup of coffee. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get some food at the grocery store. I\u2019m going to see my house, which is being renovated, and probably go on a little hike\u2014it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d She puts on her Becca lipgloss and heads out the door.", "Of course, Ferreira isn\u2019t your typical 23-year-old. A Gen-Z household name thanks to topical roles on Euphoria and Unpregnant, she\u2019s already hitting the kinds of significant milestones most people don\u2019t reach until their 30s and 40s, including homeownership. \u201cThis is a very big step for me,\u201d says Ferreira. \u201cI feel very adult, and I will never stop talking about how adult I feel.\u201d Walking through the construction site where your new digs will be and plotting out all the details is decidedly grown-up, but Ferreira doesn\u2019t take herself too seriously. \u201cI love camp, so everything is a little campy,\u201d she says of her decor plans. \u201cMy bathroom is going to be kind of a spa [and] downstairs we\u2019re doing a kind of \u201970s groovy thing for the TV den and the backroom. I love fun furniture, so this is going to be fun for me to decorate!\u201d", "Interior-design aspirations aside, Ferreira\u2019s day is appealingly typical. A trip to the fish market to pick up some salmon and sesame oil, followed by a hike through the Hollywood hills and a home-cooked meal complete the perfect L.A. day. \u201cMy mom and my aunt are both chefs, and I thought that it skipped a generation,\u201d Ferreira deadpans while marinating her fish. Indoors for most of 2020, Ferreira had plenty of time to practice her culinary skills\u2014her crash course in massaging kale is Food Network\u2013worthy\u2014but she\u2019s looking forward to getting back to work. Because of Europhia\u2019s outside-the-box storytelling, Ferreira is somewhat surprised by the series\u2019 mainstream success, but is as eager for more of the series as fans are. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is going to happen in season two at all,\u201d she says. \u201cMy guess is as good as yours. The comments are like \u2018leak season two,\u2019 but we haven\u2019t shot it yet; how can we leak it!\u201d", "Here, watch Ferreira enjoy a laid-back day finding coffee recipes on TikTok and indulging in a soothing eucalyptus-scented bath at home.", "Director: Rom Bokobza", "Editor: Camille Getz", "DP: Nate Gold", "Producer: Naomi Nishi"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["ferreira", "little", "24", "shes", "hours", "fun", "day", "euphoric", "love", "series", "going", "la", "season", "typical", "barbie"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
