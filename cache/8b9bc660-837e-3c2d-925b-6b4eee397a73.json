However, Boorman told ADV Pulse that they managed to cover from 120 to 180 miles per day south of the U.S. border, using a combination of locally supplied power and backup battery chargers being ferried along with them by a fleet of support vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.", "Boorman said that once they crossed into the U.S., their daily average increased to 300 miles, likely thanks to a better charging network and less-challenging roads. The Livewire has an official range rating of 146 miles in mixed urban and highway riding, but it is not known if the battery packs on the bikes used were modified in any way and Boorman didn't say exactly how many miles they covered. McGregor apparently took at least one break from riding, as he made a side trip to Los Angeles in October to promote his latest film,\" Doctor Sleep.\"", "McGregor and Boorman previously circumnavigated the world in \u201cLong Way Round,\u201d and rode from Scotland to South Africa in \u201cLong Way Down.\u201d A premiere date for \u201cLong Way Up\u201d has not been announced.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"], "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/auto/ewan-mcgregor-electric-harley-davidson-livewire-western-hemisphere", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
