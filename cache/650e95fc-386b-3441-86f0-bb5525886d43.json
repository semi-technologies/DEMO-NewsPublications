It may explain why reinfections have been so rare.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very good news,\u201d said Michel Nussenzweig, head of molecular immunology at Rockefeller University in Manhattan and a senior author of a pre-published study on open-source research site BioRxiv. \u201cThe expectation is that people should be able to produce a rapid antibody response and resist infection in a large number of cases,\u201d he told the Guardian.", "Scientists call this the immune system\u2019s \u201cmemory,\u201d supported by its T- and B-cell anti-viral militias. The two immune cell types work together in their efforts to produce antibodies in the blood, then suppress and kill SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. More specifically, T-cells lead the attack against the virus directly by annihilating infected cells, while B-cells analyze the virus in order to produce antibodies, which gather and trap invaders. Finally, macrophages, yet another critical immune cell, would then come to clean up the mess.", "MAGIC MUSHROOMS COULD HELP TREAT DEPRESSION, STUDY FINDS", "Once contained, the immune system stores \u201cmemory\u201d T- and B-cells, which have since developed defenses against the coronavirus especially. If COVID-19 should return, they\u2019ll be let loose to fight the virus again.", "The Rockefeller study included 87 patients with COVID-19, who were tested for antibodies just after one month and again at around six months, by which time their defenses had fallen to only about 20% compared to patients\u2019 peak levels. However, researchers are less concerned with the overall concentration of leftover antibodies because they showed to be especially fortified to combat the disease a second time around.", "CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT OPTIONS: WHAT ARE THEY?", "At the same time, the U.K. Coronavirus Immunology Consortium recently posted an immune study of its own on BioRxiv.
