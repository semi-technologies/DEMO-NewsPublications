A century later, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s methodology for the redemption of Mexico is his morning press conference plus oil. He wants to raise oil output by almost half, and is poised to build Dos Bocas, an $8bn refinery that will be his country\u2019s largest. Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador (or AMLO , as he is known) defends this as boosting Mexico\u2019s energy security and sovereignty.", "Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s far-right president, claims that environmentalism is a left-wing plot. Latin American leftists\u2019 enthusiasm for oil refineries suggests otherwise. In Brazil Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, president from 2003 to 2011, ordered Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company, to build four of them. In Ecuador, Rafael Correa conducted a $2.2bn upgrade to a refinery. Peru\u2019s Ollanta Humala began a similar $3.5bn upgrade.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "There are good reasons for AMLO to want to exploit Mexico\u2019s natural resources to the full. Oil can help power growth and fill the treasury. But he is going about it in a different way from his predecessor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who opened up oil and gas to private investment but left Pemex, the state oil company, indebted and shot through with corruption. In May, AMLO \u2019s government announced that no private bidders had met the terms for Dos Bocas\u2019s construction. It will now be handled, opaquely, by the state. He is throwing public money at Pemex without requiring its reform.", "In private, officials admit concern. Dos Bocas is a \u201cpendejada\u201d (a load of bullshit), admits one. Mexico has no trouble importing gasoline from refineries on the United States\u2019 Gulf coast, says David Shields, an energy consultant in Mexico City. Money would be better spent on repairing inefficient existing refineries, or on expanding distribution grids for electricity and natural gas (though private investment could do those jobs).", "Ideology in part explains the enthusiasm for such projects among leftists. Fossil-fuel nationalism is a throwback to the concerns of the Latin American left of the mid 20th century. AMLO \u2019s adviser for the project is Jos\u00e9 Alberto Celestinos, aged 90, who was in charge of building refineries for Pemex in the 1970s. \u201cOil is a fundamental national symbol in Mexico,\u201d says Lorenzo Meyer, a historian. \u201cTo think of clean energy policies like in Europe is a luxury Mexicans can\u2019t give themselves.\u201d", "And, of course, big state projects offer the opportunity for many to make money. Few people expect Dos Bocas to hit its budget. The only one of Lula\u2019s refineries to be completed cost $20bn, nine times its original estimate. Half of the $5bn that Mr Correa\u2019s government spent on oil projects was stolen, according to his successor.", "In energy terms, Latin America cannot be accused of being a dirty region. It has the world\u2019s cleanest energy matrix, largely because of its large hydroelectric dams (though in Mexico, with fewer big rivers, they provide less than a quarter of electricity compared with around half in the region as a whole). Most of Latin America\u2019s carbon emissions come from land-use changes and transport, as growing middle classes jump into cars. It could do its bit for the world by halting deforestation and embracing electric vehicles.", "Some Latin American countries have encouraged non-conventional renewable technologies, such as wind and solar, whose price has fallen steeply. Rather than copy European subsidies, they have done so by fixing targets and by using auctions in which the market determines the supply price, notes Lisa Viscidi, an energy specialist at the Inter-American Dialogue, a think-tank in Washington. More than 40% of Uruguay\u2019s electricity comes from wind, while solar plants provide 8% of Chile\u2019s. Both countries have had left-wing governments\u2014but have no significant oil. The same goes for Costa Rica, which has set (and appears to be on track to meet) a target of producing all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2021."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/09/19/why-latin-americas-left-loves-the-petroleum-economy", "title": "Why Latin America\u2019s left loves the petroleum economy", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["private", "dos", "latin", "loves", "energy", "oil", "amlo", "mexico", "left", "electricity", "refineries", "state", "petroleum", "americas", "economy"]}
