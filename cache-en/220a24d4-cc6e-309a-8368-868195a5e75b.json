Whenever I think of an Epi bag, I always think back to an epic Louis Vuitton campaign from 1999, featuring a sun-kissed Fernanda Tavares clutching an Epi bag as if she is Madonna with child. Everything about the campaign has a clean, sharp angle\u2014from the bend in arms to pin-straight hair\u2014to reflect the bag itself: a medium-size top handle shaped like a geometric teardrop. This campaign feels so glamorously low-key in contrast with the high-octane effect of the Louis Vuitton x Murakami campaigns that featured a flash-blasted blonde crawling among a row of the rainbow bags.", "Rhea Durham in Louis Vuitton\u2019s 1997 Centennial campaign Photo: Guzman", "While it\u2019s a classic, it doesn\u2019t have that head-turning appeal we\u2019ve come to expect from It bags. I was asking our young visuals researcher editor Lily Kupets to find images of celebrities carrying it, and her response sent a shiver up my spine. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a stylish, mature lady bag!\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I\u2019ll look.\u201d The results in the celebrity-style vein were lacking. No one was carrying it aside from Kirsten Dunst from the mid 2010s. But that\u2019s okay! The carryall is not made to be flashy or red-hot: It\u2019s made to last. Kupets added that she had always coveted an Epi bag since she worked at a resale store in her teens. \u201cWe used to get them in all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford it at the time but I always thought they were so underrated, and would wear now.\u201d", "I\u2019m ready to see more of the Epi bag; though it\u2019s a classic, it feels of the moment. It feels grown-up, and in turn, a killer investment. Also, its comeback can be tied to the maison itself, which has been pushing Epi bags over the past few years in remixed designs. Upon taking the helm, creative director Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re included the leather grain in his Petite Malle, and later the Twist for Cruise 2015, which will be rereleased this year with actress Laura Harrier as the campaign star."], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["louis", "kupets", "classic", "underrated", "feels", "vuitton", "epi", "bag", "vuittons", "reconsider", "killer", "campaign", "think"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
