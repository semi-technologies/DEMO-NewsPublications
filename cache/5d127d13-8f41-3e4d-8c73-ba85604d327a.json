In a heated private conference call on Thursday, centrist and progressive members of the House Democratic caucus jostled over who or what was to blame for the Party\u2019s unexpectedly weak showing in congressional races. (With a number of contests still to be called, the G.O.P. has already made a net gain of five seats.) At the local level, there is also a lot of sparring over why the Party failed in its bid to gain control of legislatures in a number of big states, including Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas.", "The first step in any political inquest is to figure out exactly what happened. The Democrats\u2019 struggles in local and statewide races will take more time to unpack, but there are data already available about the race at the top of the ticket that can offer some insight into what happened in 2020. Even here, however, there isn\u2019t much agreement. The nationwide exit poll that Edison Research carries out for a consortium of media companies indicated that Trump got fifty-seven per cent of the white vote, the same number that he got in 2016, but also did better than expected among minority voters, particularly Hispanics. Some Democratic activists have questioned the poll findings, however. \u201cAre these exit polls real?\u201d Ezra Levin, the co-founder of Indivisible, a grassroots progressive organization, asked on Twitter. When I messaged Levin and asked for his interpretation of the election results, he replied, \u201cWe just don\u2019t have enough info yet to really say what happened. I have no idea if most of the quick takes out there right now are right or wrong, but nobody really does yet.\u201d", "Levin isn\u2019t the only person querying the exit poll, which was conducted outside of polling centers across the country (and by telephone in an effort to reach people who voted early or by mail). Partly because of the challenge in obtaining representative samples, and for other reasons, some academic experts on voting trends are also highly skeptical of the network exit poll. \u201cI think all of their estimates are pretty suspect,\u201d Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told me on Friday. Citing an example, Teixeira pointed out that, although other estimates have suggested that at least seventy per cent of the 2020 electorate was white, the exit poll came up with a figure of sixty-five per cent. \u201cNot on this planet, not in this election,\u201d Teixeira said.", "A longtime student of psephology, Teixeira is a co-author of the influential book \u201cThe Emerging Democratic Majority,\u201d from 2002. More recently, he and some co-authors have produced a series of detailed studies of the U.S. electorate, which are called \u201cStates of Change,\u201d and which utilize data from a number of different sources, including the Census Bureau, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, and actual election returns down to the county level. Rather than relying on the exit poll to analyze what went down in this election, Teixeira said that he preferred to look at the findings of a different survey, the A.P. VoteCast, which questioned more than a hundred thousand voters in all fifty states during the week leading up to November 3rd. To see how 2020 compared to 2016, Teixeira then compared the A.P. VoteCast findings to the analyses of the 2016 election by the \u201cStates of Change\u201d project. Although this comparison isn\u2019t an apples-to-apples one, it does provide an alternative way of looking at the election results and identifying their key features. \u201cIt\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s probably the best we have at the moment,\u201d Teixeira said.", "In some ways, this exercise produces similar results to a simple comparison of the exit polls from 2016 and 2020. Both methods confirm that Trump\u2019s voters are overwhelmingly white and predominantly male. The two methods also indicate that, relative to Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance four years ago, Biden made up substantial ground among seniors and white voters without a bachelor\u2019s degree\u2014two groups that Trump carried by large margins in 2016. The two methods also show Trump getting roughly a third of the Latino vote nationwide. However, Teixeira\u2019s methodology produces quantitatively different results, and it fails to confirm the widely publicized exit-poll finding that Trump attracted a lot more Black voters this year than he did four years ago. \u201cI am very unpersuaded that the Democrats\u2019 margin among Black voters went down a lot,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cI think it was probably relatively stable.\u201d", "Another big difference between Teixeira\u2019s analysis and the media narrative taking hold in the past few days is the emphasis that he places on Biden\u2019s ability to limit his losses among whites without a college degree, a group central to Trump\u2019s base. For decades, this group made up the majority of the electorate, and, this year, it still accounted for more than two-fifths of it, Teixeira and his colleagues reckon. In 2016, Trump beat Clinton by a whopping thirty-two percentage points in this demographic, according to estimates contained in the latest \u201cStates of Change\u201d report. This year, Trump\u2019s margin over Biden in this group was twenty-five points, the A.P. VoteCast found. To be sure, that was another big victory for Trump. But it represented a seven-point shift to the Democratic candidate relative to 2016, and Teixeira argues that this was a key factor\u2014perhaps the key factor\u2014that laid the groundwork for Biden\u2019s victory in the Electoral College. \u201cThe theory that Biden would win, to a great extent, because he could reduce the white, non-college deficit turned out to be true,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t win by as much as people wanted. Plus, people have trouble getting their minds around the fact that to go from minus thirty-two to minus twenty-five is just as good as going from plus seven to plus fourteen. And if the former group is bigger, it is actually better.\u201d", "Turning to college-educated whites, Teixeira\u2019s method suggests that Biden didn\u2019t actually make up much ground in this demographic, despite all the attention that has been paid to suburban voters. By contrast, the Edison exit poll indicated that Biden turned Clinton\u2019s three-point deficit among these voters from 2016 into a tie with Trump, at forty-nine per cent. Teixeira\u2019s figures do suggest that the white college demographic was important in some key states, such as Michigan, where Biden improved Clinton\u2019s margin by fourteen points. On a nationwide basis, however, the exit poll and Teixeira\u2019s analysis both indicate that the shift in this white college demographic was smaller than the shift in the white non-college one. \u201cThe biggest swing in the Democrats\u2019 direction was not among white college voters, it was among white non-college voters,\u201d Teixeira said.", "The fact that Biden outperformed Clinton among older Americans, who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, appears to be another key element in his victory. This is evident in the exit-poll data, which indicate that the former Vice-President reduced Trump\u2019s 2016 margin of seven points to three points among voters aged sixty-five and over, who make up more than a fifth of the electorate. It\u2019s even more stark in Teixeira\u2019s comparison. His \u201cStates of Change\u201d data suggest that Trump carried the senior demographic by fifteen points in 2016\u2014a much bigger margin than the exit poll suggested. For 2020, the A.P. VoteCast survey agrees with the Edison exit poll that Trump led Biden by three points among seniors. So, going by Teixeira\u2019s methodology, there was a hefty shift of twelve points relative to 2016. That jibes with some of the polling done during the campaign, which I wrote about as far back as June. But for Democrats it raises questions about 2024. Assuming that the pandemic is long gone by then, it would seem reasonable to suppose that some of the senior vote might shift back to a Republican Presidential candidate. Which means that Biden, or whoever the Democratic candidate is, would need to make the margin up elsewhere.", "The gains that Trump posted among Hispanic voters are another pressing concern for the Democrats. According to the Edison exit poll, thirty-two per cent of Latinos voted for Trump nationwide, compared to twenty-eight per cent in 2016. The A.P. VoteCast survey estimate of the Trump vote among Latinos is even higher\u2014thirty-five per cent. If you compare this figure to the \u201cStates of Change\u201d estimates, you find that Trump reduced his deficit in the Latino demographic from thirty-seven points in 2016 to twenty-eight points this year. With Latinos now making about a seventh of the electorate, the largest minority group, this is a big shift. And, according to Teixeira\u2019s analysis, it wasn\u2019t confined to Cubans in Florida, or even to the whole of Florida and parts of Texas. It was evident in places like Arizona and Nevada, too. According to the \u201cStates of Change\u201d estimates for the 2016 election, Clinton\u2019s winning margin among Hispanics in these two states was thirty-three points and twenty-two points, respectively. This year, according to the findings of A.P. VoteCast, Biden\u2019s margins were twenty one points and ten points. In other words, there were double-digit shifts to Trump in both states.", "Finally, back to Black voters, who make up about twelve per cent of the electorate. According to the exit poll, Trump raised his share of the Black vote from eight per cent in 2016 to twelve per cent this year\u2014and to eighteen per cent among Black men. Not surprisingly, given Trump\u2019s racial incitements and the derogatory comments that he has repeatedly made about Black politicians and journalists, these findings have received a lot of attention\u2014but Teixeira\u2019s analysis contradicts them. Based on \u201cStates of Change\u201d data, he and his co-authors estimate the Black vote for Trump in 2016 to have been nine per cent, and the A.P. VoteCast puts the figure for 2020 year at eight per cent."], "authors": ["John Cassidy", "John Cassid", "David Remnic", "Eliza Griswol"], "keywords": ["happened", "points", "exit", "cent", "democrats", "question", "voters", "trump", "2016", "teixeira", "states", "poll", "white", "answer", "election"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
