What went wrong?\u201d asked one biographer of Louis Armstrong. \u201cThe sheer weight of his success and its attendant commercial pressures,\u201d answered another.", "The popular opinion of the trumpeter and gravel-voiced singer of What a Wonderful World is as a genial, foundational voice in jazz. But the jazz establishment \u2013 and many African Americans \u2013 reviled him as a sellout or an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d. When he died in 1971, he was seen as having peaked in the 1920s with the Hot Five and the Hot Seven, a series of inventive small-band recordings, and been in decline ever since. A new book, Ricky Riccardi\u2019s Heart Full of Rhythm: the Big Band Years of Louis Armstrong, charts this apparent fall from grace, but shows the reality to be far more complicated.", "After signing with Decca in the mid-1930s, Armstrong began working with Joe Kapp, a svengali producer who boasted of keeping a \u201cpulse on the multitude\u201d. The singer switched from respected Dixieland jazz to populist fare: Bing Crosby collaborations, Hawaiian instrumentals, syrupy romances, Iberian mariachis, and B-list comedy movies. At record speed, Armstrong would become America\u2019s first black multimedia star, and was often hated for it: Gunther Schuller, the noted American jazz critic, remarked that \u201ccreepy tentacles of commercialism\u201d had laid bare a \u201cwasteland\u201d in Armstrong\u2019s career for more than 40 years.", "\u201cThe band behind him are positively abominable. Nothing could possibly do more harm to such a great artist. It\u2019s absolutely murderous,\u201d one critic wrote in Metronome magazine. \u201cArmstrong no longer is a vital force in hot jazz \u2026 [and] has chosen to play exclusively for the box-office,\u201d published Music and Rhythm.", "On the set of A Rhapsody in Black and Blue, the earliest surviving footage of Armstrong on film. Photograph: Courtesy of the Louis Armstrong House Museum", "African Americans found Armstrong more troubling still. The handkerchief-holding persona \u2013 cheerful, fond of silly jokes \u2013 he\u2019d perfected had echoes of an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d, a black person who happily does the bidding of a white master.", "Bob O\u2019Meally, the head of jazz studies at Columbia University in New York, remains divided. While lauding Armstrong as \u201cone of the greatest people of the 20th century\u201d, he was \u201coffended by his presentations \u2026 At the time of the rise of Malcolm X, the authority of Martin Luther King, examples in the popular media like Muhammad Ali and others, there was Armstrong \u2013 a kind of throwback from another era, with this borderline minstrelsy role that he played. I cringed as a black American.\u201d", "Armstrong\u2019s reputation has improved since, but there\u2019s still much room to recover \u2013 and not least in elite circles. Riccardi, a director of research collections at the Louis Armstrong House Museum, recalls that his master\u2019s at Rutgers University in jazz history devoted just two hours to Armstrong in the whole programme. \u201cI go into universities now, and everybody knows every Charlie Parker solo in every key. I say, \u2018OK, how many of you have ever checked out Louis Armstrong?\u2019 Blank faces.\u201d", "Riccardi\u2019s book spans 1929 to 1947, when Armstrong became the world\u2019s biggest pop star. But going against the usual complaints of critics \u2013 who portray the period in almost-Faustian terms \u2013 Riccardi sees Armstrong\u2019s escape from jazz royalty as the man\u2019s true making.", "For one, crossing over (or \u201cselling out\u201d) as an African American in the 1930s was hardly a ticket to gold and glamour. Just as he got started, Armstrong was jailed and kicked out of California for smoking cannabis; he was later chased from Chicago by gun-toting gangsters and forced to travel with permanent armed protection. On tour in the deep south, Armstrong was turned away constantly from lodgings, struggled getting gigs from racist promoters and was harassed by police. He was sent to jail again while on a pit stop in Memphis, after onlookers grew suspicious about the band\u2019s nice suits, \u201cfancy-looking cigarette holders\u201d, and that the manager\u2019s white wife was sat on the bus.", "His times in Europe were no less challenging. On his first night in London in 1932, Armstrong couldn\u2019t get to bed until 5am because hotels wouldn\u2019t admit black guests. Reviewers wrote of \u201crhythmical jungle noises\u201d, his \u201chippopotamus physiognomy\u201d, \u201cgravelly gorilla roar\u201d, and \u201cwild Negro African ancestor\u2019s primitive cries\u201d.", "Yet as Riccardi emphasises, meeting culture in the middle meant Armstrong could change things from within. The list of firsts he oversaw is staggering. Knockin\u2019 a Jug, which featured black and white musicians, was one of the US\u2019s first integrated recordings. That same year, he cut the first integrated vocal duet, Rockin\u2019 Chair, with white singer Hoagy Carmichael. Black and Blue, a 1929 B-side on Okeh Records\u2019 \u201cpopular music\u201d listings (a label that had previously marketed him for \u201crace records\u201d), has been called American music\u2019s first bona fide protest song against racial inequality.", "Lobby card for the now-lost movie Ex-Flame filmed in California in 1930, and featuring Armstrong alongside trombonist Lawrence Brown, pianist Henry Prince, saxophonist Les Hite and 22-year-old drummer Lionel Hampton. Photograph: The Jack Bradley Collection, Louis Armstrong House Museum", "On tour in New Orleans, his home town, Armstrong handed out cash in the street, bought a radio set for the orphanage where he grew up, and was the first African American to do his own announcing on city radio. In a first for black musicians, he published an autobiography, Swing That Music, in 1936. The following year, he was the first African American to host a national radio show, and get featured billing in a Hollywood film. For O\u2019Meally, the Columbia jazzer who grew up sceptical, Armstrong\u2019s importance for the cause of racial equality is simply \u201cincalculable.\u201d", "At the same time, working the culture from within could raise difficult questions. His stage persona \u2013 later problematised by African Americans in the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 seemed to fit the cloying stereotypes manufactured by a cynical white media. \u201cHe made a lot of black people uncomfortable\u201d, the African American critic Gerald Early said, and Miles Davis, still fond of Armstrong, resented his penchant for \u201cclowning\u201d.", "His film appearances in the 1930s posed a particular challenge. In Pennies from Heaven, a launchpad for Armstrong\u2019s multimedia success, he played a mentally challenged farmer that couldn\u2019t count. He was draped in a Tarzan cape in a movie soon after, and was even directly named Uncle Tom in another.", "I wouldn\u2019t judge Armstrong. The delicacy of the balancing act meant that at times he did fall, he did falter Bob O'Meally", "Riccardi offers a subtler take. The tide had certainly turned against him by the 1960s, he concedes, but African Americans were once overwhelmingly supportive of Armstrong. \u201cThe black press, they constantly praised his personality\u201d while he rose to fame, he says. \u201cThey love the showmanship. They love everything. And I think that\u2019s what always rankled Armstrong [with the Uncle Tom allegations, because] that persona, the smile, the humour, the jokes, the comedy, all the non-musical aspects of his stage persona, were perfected in front of black audiences.\u201d", "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t judge Armstrong\u201d, O\u2019Meally says. \u201cThe delicacy of the balancing act meant that at times he did fall, he did falter, and contradicted what Martin Luther King and others were trying to do.\u201d", "Testing the demarcation lines of jazz would always touch on race, too. \u201cJazz is an extension of the black voice, of black style, of moving\u201d, O\u2019Meally says. And even as Armstrong moved away from jazz and apparently pandered to white audiences, O\u2019Meally still detects an immutable black essence in his music: \u201ca sense of an audience around the corner\u201d, one away from the white wings, to whom he was really performing.", "How Armstrong affected jazz music itself is equally contestable. Catherine Russell is a jazz singer and the daughter of Luis Russell, who worked as Armstrong\u2019s bandleader, including on Song of the Islands, a 1930 Hawaiian muzak single some considered \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d. Jazz has always been a mixture of \u201chigh art\u201d and \u201cfolk art\u201d, she says, and Armstrong never affected a particular loyalty to either.", "His best work, she says \u2013 especially the Hot Five recordings of the 1920s \u2013 are hardly classical fineries. Big Butter and Egg Man, Irish Black Bottom, Big Fat Ma and Skinny Pa: the Hot Five were dealing in the everyday crudities of blues, putting New Orleans street humour to song. Things would change in the 1940s. Led by Dizzy Gillespie and Parker in New York, the new bebop sound paid little mind to the demands of easy listening. It was harsher, more cerebral, heavily improvised, and conceived as a direct challenge to what Gillespie termed Armstrong\u2019s \u201cUncle Tom sound\u201d.", "Armstrong saw danger in bebop. Its \u201cweird notes\u201d and \u201cChinese music\u201d was made only for other musicians, he feared, and the consequences would soon come to bear. You could plausibly trace the bebop germ to the 1960s, when it flowered in the dissonant avant garde of free jazz: a sound so harsh and abrasive, the story goes, that black audiences were driven to more accessible alternatives in other genres. If musicians had kept a closer eye on Armstrong\u2019s open-ended approach, Riccardi asks, one wonders where jazz may have headed, and how popular it\u2019d be today.", "From left to right: Dizzy Gillespie, unidentified, Louis Armstrong, Arvell Shaw and Big Sid Catlett at a nightclub in the late 1940s. Photograph: Courtesy of the Louis Armstrong House Museum", "Yet mixing genres, as Armstrong did, could dilute jazz\u2019s musical core. Crucially, the closer jazz gets to the pop and institutional mainstream, critic Gary Giddins feared in Visions of Jazz, the more a dependence on \u201cbig money\u201d, corporate donations and government grants may gnaw at its inner authenticity: the energy that enabled \u201cits glorious eruptions\u201d last century. But playing the field is often the thing keeping jazz alive, and prompts innovation in its own way: think of Davis\u2019s experiments with funk, the growth of jazz fusion in the 1970s, or how most jazz musicians today make their money from playing in other genres. It was called selling out then; it\u2019s collaboration now.", "\u201cI don\u2019t see Armstrong turning against the revolution. He had fomented it in the first place and then stepped aside from it and kept going,\u201d O\u2019Meally says. And no matter how rapacious or all-encroaching the music business gets, nothing can ever kill jazz, he claims. Its musical identity \u2013 chordal experimentation, the blues undercurrent, playing with notions of time \u2013 remains as influential as ever. Even hip-hop is \u201cone of the extensions of the world of Louis Armstrong\u201d, O\u2019Meally says, pointing to Biggie Smalls\u2019 reputed schooling in jazz.", "All in all, maybe Armstrong did \u201csell out\u201d. But in doing so he secured his place in history. Roy Eldridge, \u201cHot Lips\u201d Page, Henry \u201cRed\u201d Allen, Rex Stewart: the 20th century had plenty of trumpet gods, but they\u2019re sadly forgotten to most.", "Armstrong took a different path. \u201cWhen the world is ready to define what we mean by modernism, we will realise that the shift away from 19th-century forms of music, vocal and instrumental, was something achieved by African Americans,\u201d O\u2019Meally concludes. \u201cArmstrong led the band.\u201d", "\u2022 Heart Full of Rhythm: The Big Band Years of Louis Armstrong by Ricky Riccardi is out now, published by Oxford University Press."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["white", "louis", "american", "african", "jazz", "hated", "black", "wonderful", "world", "armstrongs", "music", "armstrong", "omeally"], "pubDate": "2020-12-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
