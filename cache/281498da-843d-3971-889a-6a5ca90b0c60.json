He\u2019s been banned from Twitter for operating fake accounts. He\u2019s been charged with securities fraud. He\u2019s admitted to promoting false news to smear Democrats. He\u2019s tried to frame Robert Mueller and Pete Buttigieg for sexual assault. He\u2019s attempted so much crime in such a short time that he\u2019s basically an honorary Trump.", "This week, Wohl struck again. And by \u201cstruck\u201d I mean \u201cmade a complete fool of himself\u201d. On Thursday Wohl and Jack Burkman, another conservative activist, held a \u201cpress conference\u201d in which they claimed Elizabeth Warren, 70, paid for the sexual services of a 24-year-old former marine called Kelvin Whelly. \u201cThese charges will shock the conscious of the nation,\u201d a media release that went out before the event promised. Yes, that\u2019s right, these geniuses managed to misspell \u201cconscience\u201d.", "Standing in front of a big sign emblazoned with the words \u201cElizabeth Warren Cougar?\u201d on it, the senator\u2019s alleged boytoy kept on cracking up as he read his statement. In between giggles he claimed that he had been hired by Warren from a gigolo agency called Cowboys4Angels for frequent sessions of BDSM. Whelly then took off his shirt to show off a scar he says was the result of Warren whipping him.", "I don\u2019t think I need to tell you that Whelly\u2019s story is entirely made-up. However, just in case you had any doubts, the owner and CEO of Cowboys4Angels says Whelly never worked for his agency and was \u201cnot up to caliber\u201d to get a job as a gigolo. \u201cI would never even hire that guy,\u201d he told Rolling Stone. An insult which, no doubt, stung far harder than Warren\u2019s imaginary whip ever did.", "Warren, incidentally, reacted to the fact that a vile far-right troll has been writing bad erotic fanfic about her in the best, most presidential, way possible.", "\u201cIt\u2019s always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston (go Cougars!),\u201d Warren tweeted on Thursday. \u201cWe need to cancel student debt and make college free for everyone who wants it.\u201d This was accompanied with a big picture of the Houston Cougars logo. #Cougar2020 immediately started trending.", "Cougars 1; Rightwing trolls 0.", "Hello? Police? I\u2019d like to report a murder", "It\u2019s not often a 6,700-word piece of literary criticism goes viral. This week, however, everyone has been rightly raving about Patricia Lockwood\u2019s elegant evisceration of John Updike in the London Review of Books. \u201cI was hired as an assassin,\u201d Lockwood begins. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring in a 37-year-old woman to review John Updike in the year of our Lord 2019 unless you\u2019re hoping to see blood on the ceiling.\u201d A lot of blood proceeds to hit the ceiling. \u201cNo one can seem to agree on [Updike\u2019s] surviving merits,\u201d Lockwood notes. \u201cHe wrote like an angel, the consensus goes, except when he was writing like a malfunctioning sex robot attempting to administer cunnilingus to his typewriter.\u201d", "Supreme court hears first major abortion case since Kavanaugh confirmed", "On Friday, the US supreme court announced it will be reviewing a Louisiana regulation that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital 30 miles away. This requirement severely restricts access to abortion, particularly for low-income women. The supreme court struck down a similar Texas law in 2016. Justice Anthony Kennedy cast the decisive vote in that case; he has now been replaced by Brett Kavanaugh. And we all know how much he cares about women\u2019s rights.", "Turkey rules feminist children\u2019s book should be treated like porn", "The bestselling Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls book is a collection of stories about extraordinary women from around the world. Which is dangerous stuff according to the Turkish government, which recently ruled that portions of the book \u201cwill have a detrimental influence on the minds of those under the age of 18\u201d. This means it can only be sold to adults and has to be hidden from view in bookshops.", "\u2018Women in this class are useless\u2019", "A North Carolina physics professor allegedly told students: \u201cI guess the women in this class are useless. Maybe I should call on a man.\u201d Dr. E David Davis later explained this was \u201ca joke\u201d. He has now been suspended, so I guess the joke\u2019s on him.", "Over 30% of Japanese women with mental health issues blame workplace harassment", "According to a government survey released on Tuesday, 36% of Japanese women with mental illnesses said it was caused by some form of harassment at work. As CNN reports, \u201cJapan remains a male-dominated society and \u2026 is ranked 110 out of 149 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) latest global gender gap index.\u201d", "Praise be, we finally know what The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is about", "A Canadian couple recently made the somewhat bizarre choice of incorporating a Handmaid\u2019s Tale-themed wedding photo into their nuptials. Nothing says \u201ceternal love\u201d, after all, like a picture of the happy couple kissing in front of a \u201changing wall\u201d surrounded by Handmaids who are raped and forced to bear children. Anyway, the photo circulated online this week and sparked predictable outrage. Now the photographers have weighed in to say the photo was not tasteless and weird, it was actually meant to \u201cwake people up\u201d about the \u201coppression\u201d in Margaret Atwood\u2019s novel. Really brave of them to wake people up like this. I don\u2019t know about you but until I saw that photo I was laboring under the delusion that the Handmaid\u2019s Tale was a quirky romcom featuring a strong female lead."], "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
