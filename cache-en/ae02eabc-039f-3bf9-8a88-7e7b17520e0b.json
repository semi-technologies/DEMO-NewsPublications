He has to respect all the religions of his city, he explains. Most Sinhalese, the country\u2019s biggest ethnic group, are Buddhist; Tamils, who predominate in the north, including Jaffna, tend to be Hindu, and there are also small Christian and Muslim minorities. (Mr Arnold himself is Christian.) The ecumenical display, however, prompted griping from his staff: there is little sense of unity in Jaffna these days, even among the Tamil majority, let alone between religions and ethnicities.", "Tamil hopes for an independent homeland were dashed in 2009, when the government defeated the Tamil Tigers, a ruthless separatist insurgency. But many in the north still hanker for autonomy, as promised by amendments to the constitution adopted in 1987 but never fully implemented. Anxieties about majority rule have swelled since the election last year as president of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who as number two in the Ministry of Defence presided over the defeat of the Tigers in a campaign in which many Tamil civilians also died.", "For almost 20 years the main standard-bearer for Tamils in Sri Lankan politics has been the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ), a multi-party union led by Mr Arnold\u2019s Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi ( ITAK ). But in elections in August, it slumped from 16 seats in the 225-seat parliament to ten. (Mr Arnold was one of its losing candidates.)", "Mathiaparanan Sumanthiran, the TNA \u2019s spokesman and an MP , blames this \u201cvery serious setback\u201d on popular disillusionment after the TNA failed to strike a deal on autonomy with the previous president, Maithripala Sirisena. The alliance had been instrumental in Mr Sirisena\u2019s surprise victory over Mahinda Rajapaksa, the brother of Gotabaya, in presidential elections in 2015. Yet reconstruction and development of the north after the long civil war was neglected under Mr Sirisena. Equally gallingly, an assembly to draft a new constitution came and went without making a specific proposal. Mr Sirisena began feuding with his prime minister, and most reforms went out of the window. \u201cWe put all our eggs in one basket,\u201d laments Mr Sumanthiran.", "The result has been a fracturing of Tamil politics. Canagasabapathy Wigneswaran, a retired Supreme Court judge who had served as the chief minister of Northern Province, of which Jaffna is the capital, left the TNA to form his own party. He won a seat in parliament in August, as did Gajendrakumar Ponnamabalam, another Tamil nationalist who split from ITAK . Others threw their lot in with the Rajapaksa brothers\u2019 party, the Sri Lanka People\u2019s Front ( SLPF ), on the basis that it could at least provide funds for development. One of them, Angajan Ramanathan, also won a seat. Velupillai Sivagnam, a provincial councillor with ITAK who is in his 70s, cannot remember a time when there were so many different Tamil parties.", "In his maiden speech in parliament, Mr Wigneswaran demanded self-determination for Tamils, who he insisted were \u201cthe first indigenous inhabitants of this country\u201d, reigniting a long-running and futile argument over whether Sinhalese or Tamils could claim dibs on the island. But that, says Singaravelu Kumaravel, a Tamil activist, is what many Tamils want: representatives who will rail on their behalf.", "Many younger Tamils, however, are not interested in the separatist cause. They have no memory of the 26 years of civil war, says Sivasubramaniam Raguram of Jaffna University. They simply hope for better jobs, which draws them to the SLPF . Without more energised youngsters, however, the future of the \u201cliberation struggle\u201d looks grim, Mr Raguram worries."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["mr", "rajapaksa", "sri", "parliament", "north", "jaffna", "tna", "tamils", "itak", "sirisena", "fractured", "war", "tamil", "lankas", "minority", "politically"], "pubDate": "2020-11-28T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
