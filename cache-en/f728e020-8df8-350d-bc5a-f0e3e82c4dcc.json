For a dynamic sign like the Goat, you\u2019re tired all the time, and you\u2019ve been finding it difficult to concentrate. This month, prepare to continue to not get any work done. Also, that lingering career anxiety you\u2019ve been feeling isn\u2019t just in your head after all! Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s highly likely that your entire profession is screwed.", "AQUARIUS: As an air sign, you love to travel, but, for some reason, you haven\u2019t been running around as much lately. Ever since March, you\u2019ve barely ventured out, instead spending the bulk of your time online. It\u2019s a good thing you love technology, Aquarius, because the stars predict that you will be logging a lot of Zoom hours this month. Keep an eye out for a notice from your bank with some unwelcome news about your finances.", "PISCES: Poor, sensitive Pisces. This really hasn\u2019t been your year! Would it make you feel better to know that someone is admiring you from afar? That\u2019s right, some attractive stranger\u2019s eyes are set on you, dear Pisces! Unfortunately, you\u2019ll probably never meet the person.", "ARIES: Ever since Mercury entered Pisces in mid-March, you haven\u2019t been able to shake an unusual anxiety. Much of your stress is related to new developments in your career, your health, your personal life, your family, global warming, income inequality, the state of our democracy, and the industry you work in. This month, buckle up, because it\u2019s all about to get much worse. Oh, and you may receive some unfavorable information regarding your finances.", "TAURUS: The moon entered your Tenth House of Career Success at some point, but I\u2019ve lost track of when, as it\u2019s all become a meaningless blur. That said, in normal times your career might be getting a boost right now, but a cosmic shift has thrown everything into limbo. Protect that rainy-day fund, responsible Taurus, as you\u2019re about to get bad news about your finances.", "GEMINI: As the life of the party, Gemini, you have a hard time settling down. But, with Jupiter in retrograde since mid-September, it might be a good moment to avoid social gatherings. The moon in your Seventh House of Not Being an Idiot suggests that going out in public is a mistake. But, if you do, wear a fucking mask.", "CANCER: You seem pretty emotional lately, even for a Cancer. You are a sensitive creature who needs coaxing to come out of your shell. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not going to happen, at least not this month. Just remember that you\u2019re not alone\u2014well, at least metaphorically. Have you thought about adopting a pet? I know your sourdough starter is technically a living organism, but it won\u2019t love you back.", "LEO: You love drama, and, lucky for you, there\u2019s a lot of it on TV right now! But, if your moon is in Cancer, Gemini, Capricorn, Scorpio, Aquarius, Virgo, Leo, Pisces, Sagittarius, Aries, Libra, or Taurus, I would avoid cable news. Also, I hope that you have a nest egg, because you are about to receive some troubling news regarding your finances.", "VIRGO: How\u2019s it going, control freak? The past few months have been a little rocky for you, and, sorry to say, the storm doesn\u2019t appear to be subsiding. This month, try to stop obsessing about what you can\u2019t control and focus instead on what you can control, like the amount of stuff you\u2019ve been ordering on Amazon. Do you really need that six-dollar milk frother? The answer is yes.", "LIBRA: Feeling a little lonely lately? If you\u2019re single, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll stay that way for the immediate future. If you\u2019re in a relationship, good luck with that\u2014everyone I know is breaking up. On the bright side, a medical breakthrough on the horizon might make it easier for you to navigate society. The bad news: you\u2019re probably last in line for it.", "SCORPIO: Scorpio is a natural homebody, but nine months in isolation is a lot, even for you. Since you\u2019ve been moving around so much less lately, you may have put on a few pounds around your midsection, or all over your body. Don\u2019t fret, dear Scorpio. Now that Venus has entered your Fifth House of It Doesn\u2019t Even Matter Anymore, no one is likely to notice.", "SAGITTARIUS: As one of the most resourceful signs of the zodiac, you have all the skills necessary to weather any storm, except for the one that\u2019s currently approaching. We\u2019re about to embark on an astrological apocalypse, which isn\u2019t actually a thing, but what do I care? I\u2019m not even an astrologer. I\u2019m grasping at straws. (Remember straws?) Like everyone else in this country (except Jeff Bezos), I\u2019m scrambling to find ways to monetize my skill set now that my profession (standup comedy) won\u2019t be coming back anytime soon. Are you still reading this? Want to know what the stars have to say about your finances? It\u2019s not looking good. \u2666"], "authors": ["Jena Friedman", "Jena Friedma"], "keywords": ["pisces", "pandemic", "lately", "know", "career", "month", "horoscope", "youve", "thats", "youre", "love", "good"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
