He did so again on Friday when he was asked whether his son\u2019s work in Ukraine represented a conflict of interest. Pointing a finger at the questioner he said: \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done. No president!\u201d The Trump campaign was soon circulating a clip of the episode.", "For his allies, it is both poignant and painful that Mr. Biden\u2019s family is again at the heart of his public identity. He lost his first wife and daughter, and nearly lost his two sons, in a car accident in the weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972. His final years as vice president, as well as his hopes to run for president in 2016, were overwhelmed by his elder son Beau\u2019s death from brain cancer.", "Jim Mowrer, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa who served with Beau Biden in the military, said he spoke to Hunter Biden early this year and got the impression he was trying to focus on personal matters rather than the campaign.

Mr. Schultz assured the group that they had a path to the nomination that depended on winning South Carolina \u2014 the fourth primary state \u2014 and then scoring big victories in the Super Tuesday primaries in March.", "In South Carolina, where Mr. Biden\u2019s support appears strongest among the early-voting states, some of his supporters are discussing a trip to Iowa before Thanksgiving \u2014 to vouch for the former vice president, and to emphasize his ability to appeal to minority constituencies, like African-Americans."], "id": "a3ec5699-c0e7-3f2f-a2b5-4a0362bf1f73", "pubDate": null, "title": "Biden Faced His Biggest Challenge, and Struggled to Form a Response"}
