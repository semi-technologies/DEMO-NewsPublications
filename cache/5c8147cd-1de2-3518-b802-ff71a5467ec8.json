A total of 198 Covid vaccines are under development worldwide, with four key versions undergoing final phase 3 trials. These include Pfizer\u2019s BNT162b2 and the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Results of those trials \u2013 in which each is compared with a placebo \u2013 are expected in weeks or months.", "A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.

They may instead reduce the severity of illness, so people avoid hospital and deaths are reduced.", "They may also not last, so that boosters will be needed.
