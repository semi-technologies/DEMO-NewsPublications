She is Pastor Cori Bush, having founded a church in her native St. Louis, about a decade ago. She is also Cori Bush, registered nurse. And now she is Congresswoman-elect Cori Bush. Her victory, a romp in Missouri\u2019s First Congressional District that saw her win by sixty percentage points, was foretold by the August Democratic primary, when Bush, running as a progressive in the anti-sclerotic mode of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, defeated Lacy Clay, the incumbent. A member of a local African-American political dynasty, Clay has represented the district since 2001, having succeeded his father, Bill, who was first elected in 1968. Bush, forty-four, isn\u2019t just new blood. She will be both the first Black woman and likely the first nurse to represent Missouri in Congress. (Sending clergy to Washington, D.C., is old hat for the Show-Me State.)", "Cori Bush Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "Despite its blue tilt, Bush\u2019s district contains multitudes. It includes the St. Louis Cardinals, Anheuser-Busch headquarters, and the city\u2019s upscale Central West End neighborhood, home to Mark and Patricia McCloskey. They are the couple who became famous this summer\u2014and earned a speaking spot at the Republican National Convention\u2014for waving guns at Black Lives Matter marchers while dressed like models in the most ill-conceived Talbots catalogue ever. Among the marchers that day was Bush; her district also includes Ferguson, where the B.L.M. movement was galvanized, in 2014, following the killing of eighteen-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer. Those protests are what propelled Bush into running for office\u2014something that, as the daughter of a politician, she had sworn she would never do. Her father, Errol Bush, is an alderman and a former mayor of Northwoods, a small city in St. Louis County. \u201cWith all the negativity and all the corruption around, with everything he had to fight, I was, like, Why would you sign up for this?\u201d she recalled over the phone, two days after her own election.", "The gravity of what happened in Ferguson had dawned on her only gradually, as did her anger. \u201cThat afternoon, I was scrolling on Facebook, seeing this picture of this person laying on the ground,\u201d she said of the August day when Brown was shot at least six times. Police then left his body in the street for four hours, on a hot afternoon. \u201cI kept seeing the picture and just not thinking it was real,\u201d she said. Finally, \u201cI\u2019m, like, O.K., let me click on this and see what this is about.\u201d The next evening, she drove to Ferguson, where a second night of demonstrations had begun. \u201cI just drove around, stayed in my car, and just watched what was going on. Then, the next day, I actually got out. It was the fact that the thing didn\u2019t go away, that it was gaining steam.\u201d Looting had begun; a building had burned. \u201cThere were thousands of people in the street, with a lot of violence happening. I felt like I could offer something to this situation. I was, like, You\u2019re a nurse, you can be a medic. You\u2019re clergy, you can go out and pray with people.\u201d", "Through the mental-health clinic where she worked, she helped set up a crisis-response team. \u201cWe pitched a tent just a few feet from where Michael Brown\u2019s body had laid on the ground, to do grief-and-trauma work.\u201d Her group partnered with others to provide food, diapers, and financial assistance to people whose lives had been disrupted.", "By Bush\u2019s account, she grew up inured to racist treatment from cops. \u201cI never really questioned it,\u201d she said.\u201cI saw countless friends abused by the police, harassed by the police, profiled by the police, in different parts of town. As a child, my father was pulled over by the police so many times, I used to think that he was a horrible driver, and I would get so upset, like, \u2018Why won\u2019t you drive right?\u2019 \u201d She went on, \u201cI didn\u2019t think hard on the question of Is this O.K. or not? Is this right? Because you\u2019re taught in school that the police are right.\u201d Her impulse as a girl was to blame herself for two instances when, she said, officers sexually harassed her. \u201cIt was, like, O.K., well, maybe I\u2019m doing something wrong. Maybe this skirt isn\u2019t the right skirt. That was the mind-set at that time.\u201d", "With the speech-making skills of a preacher and a nurse\u2019s backbone, Bush became a leading voice in the Black Lives Matter movement. Urged on by fellow-activists who wanted to see more Black women in the Senate, she ran in 2016, when Roy Blunt, the Republican incumbent, was up for re\u00eblection; she came in a distant second in the primary. In 2018, she set her sights on Lacy Clay, losing again. But this year, buoyed by the surge of B.L.M. activism, and despite being slowed by a nasty case of what was likely Covid-19, which sent her to the hospital twice, Bush broke through.", "She said she\u2019s not concerned about the way that many Republicans have treated Congress\u2019s young progressive women of color as punching bags\u2014Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, who campaigned for Bush during the 2018 primary. \u201cI have been dealing with anger from the right wing, from extremists, from white supremacists, since 2014, and I\u2019ve learned the best ways for me to deal with it,\u201d Bush said. One of those ways is to shrug it off and laugh, as she did when Mark McCloskey called her a \u201cMarxist revolutionary\u201d at the Republican Convention. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t scare me in the scariest time, which was Ferguson before everybody started to get used to protests, when all of that was new, am I bothered by what they\u2019ll try to do to me now? Not at all.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Bruce Handy", "Bruce Hand"], "keywords": ["district", "congress", "woman", "youre", "cori", "represent", "black", "republican", "primary", "bush", "right", "ferguson", "missouri", "st", "nurse"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
