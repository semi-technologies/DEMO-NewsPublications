Atul Gawande, a New Yorker staff writer who was recently appointed to President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s COVID-19 task force, walks David Remnick through some of the challenges of this pivotal moment. F.D.A. approval of at least one vaccine is expected imminently, but hospitalizations are still rising rapidly around the country, and Gawande is concerned that news of an approval could lead to more irresponsible behavior. \u201cIf, once people start getting vaccinated, they start throwing the masks away and you can\u2019t get them to do social distancing,\u201d he said, \u201cthen you\u2019re really relying on vaccination as the sole prong of the strategy.\u201d More than forty per cent of people polled say they are reluctant to take the new vaccines, but Gawande suspects that the real number of resisters may be much smaller. \u201cPart of the reason it\u2019s good that health-care workers would go first is [that] . . . health-care workers are everywhere.
