He emphasized the success of nonviolence as a tactic, prompting me to think back to the sixties and early seventies, when civil disobedience in response to the Vietnam War was widespread. While the commitment to nonviolence was undeniably tactical, it was also a spiritual choice, evidenced by the roles that Quakers and the Catholic left played in organizing the movement. I understand spiritual commitment as an alignment with something bigger than divisive self-interest. The fact that people are willing to risk their well-being for the sake of a cause greater than their own interests remains surprising and powerful. Understanding this less tangible aspect of nonviolent action feels important in the present moment.", "Gendo Allyn Field", "Lebanon, N.H.", "Marantz\u2019s piece shows how far acceptance of nonviolent resistance has come in the U.S. I was a student at Harvard in 1969, when the political scientist Gene Sharp, whose ideas Marantz discusses, was a research associate, working out of the Center for International Affairs, which many students visited only during protests. (Henry Kissinger had an office there before joining the Nixon Administration.) I was considering filing for conscientious-objector status and needed help thinking that through. One day, I saw a notice on a campus bulletin board about a series of talks Sharp was giving on civil disobedience. He demonstrated how saying no to violence but yes to nonviolent resistance was perhaps the most powerful way to stop oppression. It is refreshing, fifty years later, to see tenured professors at respected institutions, like Erica Chenoweth, also at Harvard, studying and supporting nonviolence as an effective mainstream weapon against autocracy and totalitarianism.", "Allen Gilbert", "Worcester, Vt.", "The Right Questions", "I enjoyed Louis Menand\u2019s philosophical exploration of knowledge through \u201cJeopardy!\u201d and Wikipedia (Books, November 23rd). As a high-school teacher for more than twenty years, I have witnessed the move from \u201cknowing things\u201d to \u201clooking things up.\u201d And, while I have no preference for either, I agree with Menand: knowing things might be entertaining, but knowledge isn\u2019t always trustworthy and may not even prove useful. I have taken up a new mantra with my students: It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s the questions you think to ask. Maybe Alex Trebek\u2019s search for questions will prove to be his greatest legacy.", "Kyle Reynolds", "Wolfeboro, N.H.", "Menand suggests that \u201cthe reason most people today who work in and on digital media have such warm feelings about Wikipedia\u201d may be because of the site\u2019s \u201chacker ethos.\u201d Yet there are inherent problems with the simple principle that anyone can edit. Fewer than twenty per cent of Wikipedia\u2019s editors are women; as a result, the site often exhibits and perpetuates gender bias. Only nineteen per cent of its biographical pages feature women, and many articles on gendered topics lack a neutral point of view. This is frightening, given that Wikipedia is now many people\u2019s go-to information source. As one of the women who have entered the fray, I have found editing gender bias out of Wikipedia to be a Sisyphean task. If, as Menand asserts, \u201cWikipedia is neoliberalism applied to knowledge,\u201d it is yet another example of how the invisible hand has failed to create an equitable society.", "Michele Beaulieux", "Chicago, Ill.", "\u2022", "Letters should be sent with the writer\u2019s name, address, and daytime phone number via e-mail to themail@newyorker.com.
