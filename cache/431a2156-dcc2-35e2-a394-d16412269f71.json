In an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News, largely remembered for Wallace confronting Trump with the \u201cvery hard\u201d cognitive test the president claimed to have taken \u2013 the test required the sitter to identify an elephant, an alligator and a snake \u2013 Wallace asked Trump if he would accept the election results.", "\u201cI have to see,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook \u2013 I have to see. No, I\u2019m not going to just say yes. I\u2019m not going to say no.\u201d", "On other occasions he was happy to bring up the question himself.", "\u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged,\u201d Trump told the crowd at a rally in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in August. \u201cRemember that. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to lose this election.\u201d", "The president repeated the message in a rare White House news conference in September, and during the first presidential debate a week later.", "But how real is the threat of Trump refusing to accept the results?", "Well, the circumstances of hosting an election in the midst of a pandemic make it more of a possibility than in a normal election.", "The changes to voting habits have made it easier for Trump to level baseless accusations of fraud, and even create a scenario where he could prematurely declare himself the winner.", "Record numbers of Americans have voted early, with a significant proportion doing so by mail. The increased number of mail-in ballots, in particular, could mean it takes polling workers longer to count \u2013 and announce \u2013 the results.", "'Red mirage': the 'insidious' scenario if Trump declares an early victory Read more", "As some election experts have pointed out, the US could find itself in an election week, not night. If Trump finds himself in the lead early in some states, there is a chance he could declare himself the victor, before enough votes have been counted to be certain who has won.", "The likelihood of the president finding himself in an early lead is exacerbated by the trend for Democrat votes to come in later, as votes from urban areas, which tend to be more Democratic-minded, take longer to count than those from more Republican areas. An academic study has shown how \u201covertime votes\u201d \u2013 votes counted in the days after an election \u2013 have in the last 20 years shifted in favour of the Democratic candidate.", "In the Florida elections for Senate and governor in 2018, both Republican candidates\u2019 early leads shrank in the days after the vote, as mail-in ballots were counted. As Trump watched the Democratic candidates narrow the gap, he attempted to intervene.", "\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d Trump tweeted.", "\u201cAn honest vote count is no longer possible \u2013 ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d", "Exploiting confusion", "The potential for confusion, which Trump could potentially exploit, is exacerbated by laws that prevent early processing of ballots. Some key swing states \u2013 including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 are only allowed to begin opening and counting mail-in ballots on election day.", "Doing so as officials also hold an in-person election could lead to a delay in announcing results \u2013 opening the window further for a candidate to potentially, and wrongly, claim an early victory.", "Away from vote counting, Trump\u2019s rhetoric around voting fraud could also confuse matters. The president has urged his supporters to go to the polls, and in September a group of Trump backers supporters intimidated early voters at a polling location in Fairfax, Virginia.", "There is also the threat of legal action against states, as lawyers could attempt to rule ballots, particularly mail-in ballots, illegitimate.", "Post-election litigation is normal in the US, and includes issues such as allowing a poll site to remain open for two extra hours because its machines broke down in the afternoon.", "Franita Tolson, a University of Southern California law professor, said these mistakes are more dangerous because of the president\u2019s rhetoric about fraud.", "\u201cWe will be in a particularly vulnerable spot because the president has spent months and days talking about how the system is rife with voter fraud and it\u2019s rigged and it\u2019s illegitimate and all these other things,\u201d Tolson said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to not confuse election mistakes with deliberate election irregularities.\u201d", "Some experts, however, believe Trump\u2019s rhetoric has encouraged early voting and that chances have actually risen that a clear result will emerge, if not on election night, then in the following days.", "And if there is a clear result, Trump\u2019s chances of plausibly \u201cstealing the election\u201d \u2013 using the confusion of the pandemic as cover \u2013 vastly diminish.", "It has also been pointed out that, if lawsuits drag on past 20 January, preventing a victor from being declared, neither Trump nor Biden would be sworn in as president. In that scenario, the law is pretty clear:", "\u201cIf, by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, inability, or failure to qualify, there is neither a President nor Vice President to discharge the powers and duties of the office of President, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, upon his resignation as Speaker and as Representative in Congress, act as President.\u201d", "That would mean Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, would assume the presidency \u2013 presumably not an eventuality Trump has in mind.", "Play Video 6:07 Which swing states could decide the US election? \u2013 video explainer", "The barricade scenario", "In the unlikely event that Trump, still refusing to accept his loss despite Biden having been ruled the victor, barricades himself inside the White House and physically will not leave office, it\u2019s not immediately clear who would be in charge of removing him.", "\u2018It\u2019s not up to him\u2019: how media outlets plan to sidestep any Trump \u2018victory\u2019 news Read more", "Biden, back in June, said the military would remove the by-now-former president.
