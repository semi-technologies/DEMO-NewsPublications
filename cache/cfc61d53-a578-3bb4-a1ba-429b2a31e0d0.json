He was in the midst of plotting the rest of a typically peripatetic year, with trips to Thailand, New Zealand, London and Mexico, when the pandemic hit. \u201cLongest I\u2019ve been home in 20 years,\u201d Chin, who is 46, said recently. He made do, editing a book of his photographs and running nearby trails, skiing in the backcountry and racing up and down the Grand Teton, a 13,775-foot peak that figures on the life lists of most amateur climbers. \u201cI was trying to figure it out the other day,\u201d Chin said, when asked how many times he\u2019d climbed the Grand. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be up in like 50, 60, 70 times.\u201d Central to the mountaineer\u2019s life \u2014 its curse and gift \u2014 is an itch for struggle, and a willingness to scratch it that Mo Anthoine, a great British climber, called \u201cfeeding the rat.\u201d By early September, when Chin still couldn\u2019t leave the country, he got to thinking about one of the biggest objectives in his home range. Known as the Grand Traverse, this 17.9-mile romp along the Tetons\u2019 most thrilling skyline offers roughly 12,000 cumulative feet of climbing on seven major summits. It takes ultrafit regular folks three days with guides. Elite athletes like Chin do it on the regular as extreme training \u2014 current speed record, 6:30:49 \u2014 for Alaska and the Himalayas. \u201cI did it a stack of times 20 years ago,\u201d Chin told me. Back then, he\u2019d just come home from the Karakoram, a mountain range in Asia, and the Grand Traverse felt surprisingly easy.", "The Voyages Issue 11,600 feet Conrad Anker (left) and Jimmy Chin between Teewinot Mountain and Mount Owen.

He invited three other North Face athletes to join him \u2014 to do that thing they all do, for no better reason than the joy it brings \u2014 on the Grand Traverse, an excuse to breathe hard up high, move over stone in the sky, suffer enough to feel good later. Chin\u2019s team included Manoah Ainuu, a 25-year-old ice climber originally from Los Angeles who now works in a restaurant in Bozeman, Mont.; Savannah Cummins, who is 28 and climbs full time while living out of a van; and Conrad Anker, an internationally respected 57-year-old mountaineer, also based in Bozeman, who has joined Chin on so many expeditions that, while side by side in a tent recently, Chin on the left and Anker on the right as usual, Anker finally asked, \u201cWhat side of the bed do you sleep on at home?\u201d From Here is a collection of visually immersive stories that explore how communities are gathering in a time of unprecedented change.

Nonpros might have canceled, but, well, \u201cIt was the classic thing of like, \u2018Let\u2019s just go up there, and we\u2019ll make the right decisions,\u2019\u201d Chin said.", "The Voyages Issue 13,800 feet A view of the Grand Traverse from Teewinot Mountain.

Photo by Savannah Cummins", "At a trailhead 30 minutes from Chin\u2019s home, the four of them hiked and, at times, scrambled with hands and feet up a steep trail 5,593 vertical feet to the summit of Teewinot Mountain, an imposing 12,325-foot granite peak with views north into Yellowstone National Park. (Porters brought tents and cooking gear to the team\u2019s first planned campsite to offset the weight of the climbers\u2019 camera equipment.) A quick descent off the far side led to what Cummins calls \u201ca really mellow trail\u201d that was \u201cvery beautiful for like an hour or so.\u201d That trail ran out, unfortunately, in a mazelike realm of shattered cliffs and piled-up boulders where Chin discovered that his memory of the route had, as he put it, \u201ceroded significantly.\u201d Briefly lost among small rock towers, shimmying across ledges, some slick with ice, they walked carefully atop knife-blade ridges. Any given move was easy enough, but steep drop-offs on both sides focused the mind \u2014 as did the looseness of nearly every rock they touched. Cummins found her thoughts swirling: Earlier in the year, her climber boyfriend fell to his death in Mexico; she flew down to recover his body with the help of a Mexican military helicopter. Speaking of that first day on the Grand Traverse, she said: \u201cWe were in terrain where if you pulled a rock out, you would fall and die. I think having gone through that rescue process \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to deal with that.\u201d", "The Voyages Issue 12,800 feet Savannah Cummins looking over Teewinot Mountain and Mount Owen.

Manoah Ainuu and Savannah Cummins on Mount Owen. Photo by Jimmy Chin", "Next came Mount Owen, a 12,928-foot peak steep enough to demand genuine rock climbing \u2014 free solo in this case, unroped in specialized sneakers and backpacks, but mostly on what climbers would describe as \u201cgood rock,\u201d solid and hard enough that it won\u2019t crumble under a climber\u2019s body weight \u2014 \u201cWay more preferable,\u201d as Chin put it, \u201cthan scrapping around on what I call vertical kitty litter.\u201d On the steep north ridge of the Grand Teton, on Day 2, everyone roped up and belayed one another. Cold pink fingers gripped hard rock, arms and legs moved precisely without thought, lungs filled and refilled with sky and cloud \u2014 each move absorbing enough to silence the mental chatter, never hard enough to frighten, at least not in a bad way. That\u2019s also when foul weather rolled in. But they were 600 feet below the summit when they saw a \u201csucker hole of sunshine,\u201d as Cummins put it \u2014 a deceptive patch of blue sky, falsely suggesting that the storm might go easy on them. They kept climbing. But flurries of wet snow soon soaked the rock and all four climbers. Chin and Anker kicked around the idea of leaving their packs and making a dash for the summit. But as brave young climbers are often told, \u201cThere are old climbers and bold climbers but no old bold climbers.\u201d No need to risk everything at 13,000 feet on rock now icing over. They made a quick retreat off the Grand to the so-called Lower Saddle, 11,600 feet. By the time they got there, Chin said: \u201cIt is nuking. Like, properly nuking. Snowing really hard.\u201d", "The Voyages Issue 12,700 feet Conrad Anker between Mount Owen and the Grand Teton. Conrad Anker between Mount Owen and the Grand Teton.

I would be very comfortable if you said it was gusting 60 because I think it was probably gusting 70.\u201d They were shivering in wet sleeping bags, and ice was forming inside tents. \u201cI know it\u2019s a real storm,\u201d Chin said, \u201cwhen I\u2019m falling in and out of sleep and taking stock of, like: \u2018OK, my headlamp\u2019s over here. Gloves are over there. When the tent poles snap, you know where everything is, and it\u2019s going to be really unpleasant.\u2019\u201d It is an oddity of human nature, though, discoverable only through experience, that a happy, vibrant aliveness comes from what Chin calls \u201cfeeling the bite\u201d \u2014 titrated danger, discomfort \u2014 and Anker, \u201cthe anvil,\u201d that hard surface against which nature hammers us into a more resilient relationship to our own tenderness.", "The Voyages Issue 11,600 feet Setting up tents on the Lower Saddle.
