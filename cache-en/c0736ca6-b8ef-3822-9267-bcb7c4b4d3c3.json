In a hybrid of animation, interview, and archival footage reminiscent of Michel Gondry, the actor-director makes his film, about an especially complicated Hanukkah, work like a palimpsest\u2014a narrative with traces of memory insistently breaking through.", "Childhood flashbacks are rendered in hand-drawn black-and-white, giving the animations the sooty, sharply limned quality of memory. \u201cGrowing up in Russia,\u201d where Jewish education and observance were banned by the Soviet leadership, \u201cI had no clue what it meant to be Jewish,\u201d Gamburg explains. He learns quickly, in this retelling, when anti-Semitic classmates attack him. \u201cThey\u2019ve hated our people for two thousand years,\u201d Gamburg\u2019s father tells him, cutting off his mother\u2019s attempts to soothe. Soon the family is moving to America. His father hopes that Gamburg will become an aeronautical engineer. Gamburg wants to be John Travolta. In America, kids were free. \u201cFree to torment me,\u201d he explains, which turns out to be \u201cgood preparation for becoming an actor.\u201d", "Years later, as he is trying to establish his acting career in Los Angeles, Gamburg learns to tolerate the humiliations of being cast in stereotypical bit parts, until a surprise gig on \u201cConan\u201d cuts too close to the bone. He arrives on set to discover that the sketch he has been cast in is not just grotesque but deeply degrading: he is one link in a giant menorah made of human bodies, dressed in skin-tight silver and connected one to another, mouth to rear end. At this moment, knowing his family is watching him on TV, Gamburg remembers his first Hanukkah in America, his mother smiling as her son learns that the menorah, like the holiday itself, is a symbol of \u201cour fight against oppression.\u201d Onstage, the men crawl forward, the giant candles on their backs waggling; he remembers Conan \u201claughing so hard he can\u2019t speak.\u201d", "\u201cI always pick up the phone when my family calls,\u201d Gamburg explains. \u201cIt comes from a subconscious fear\u201d\u2014the film cuts to documentary footage of Jews being loaded on to cattle cars\u2014\u201cthat this might be the last time I hear from them.\u201d But, after his \u201cConan\u201d appearance, Gamburg avoids his father\u2019s calls. Shame, it seems, can overpower fear. When he finally does answer, his father\u2019s forgiveness is a kind of rebirth, like peeling off a sheath of silver latex."], "authors": ["Tana Wojczuk", "Tana Wojczu", "Daniel Gambur", "Benjamin Goldma", "Anthony Lan", "Murat Oztaski"], "keywords": ["learns", "explains", "holidays", "nostalgia", "nights", "family", "silver", "shame", "conan", "guilt", "jewish", "america", "hanukkah", "humor", "gamburg"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
