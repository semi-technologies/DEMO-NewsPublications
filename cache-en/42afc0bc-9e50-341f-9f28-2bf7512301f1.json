This dish, served in an oval-shaped enamel roaster, has made an appearance at every holiday table in my memory. As a child, I was captivated by its color\u2014a gooey m\u00e9lange of chartreuse and golden brown. For years, I couldn\u2019t imagine anything tastier: cheesy, buttery, vegetable-forward. What were these flavors?! As I grew up, I learned: frozen broccoli, a block of Velveeta cheese, a sleeve of Ritz crackers, and an entire stick of butter. Now horrified at the prospect of eating cheese that doesn\u2019t need to be refrigerated (and all those preservatives!), I have been attempting to create an organic broccoli casserole for my family over the past decade. (Nothing melts quite like Velveeta, but a proper mix of Gruy\u00e8re, fontina, and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche comes close.) This year, I\u2019ll be continuing the tradition toute seule; here\u2019s to a healthier 2021! \u2014 Jessie Heyman, Executive Editor"], "authors": [], "keywords": ["foods", "velveeta", "holiday", "broccoli", "jessie", "traditions", "vogue", "entire", "editors", "cheese", "casserole", "family", "mean", "theyll"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
