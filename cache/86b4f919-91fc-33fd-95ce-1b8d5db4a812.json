The giant floating ice island, which is only about 200 metres thick, could break apart or run aground.", "The thin profile of the iceberg, which has been monitored by satellites, may make it more liable to float closer to South Georgia before getting stuck on the ocean floor.", "Prof Geraint Tarling of the British Antarctic Survey told the BBC he was concerned about the iceberg\u2019s potential to impact South Georgia.", "\u201cA close-in iceberg has massive implications for where land-based predators might be able to forage,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about penguins and seals during the period that\u2019s really crucial to them \u2013 during pup and chick-rearing \u2013 the actual distance they have to travel to find food really matters. If they have to do a big detour, it means they\u2019re not going to get back to their young in time to prevent them starving to death in the interim.\u201d", "Tarling said while the ecosystems would bounce back there was a risk the iceberg could sit around for a decade. \u201cThat would make a very big difference, not just to the ecosystem of South Georgia, but its economy as well,\u201d he said.", "The chunk broke away from Antarctica\u2019s Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017 and, at the time, was about 175km long and about 50km wide \u2013 bigger than Luxembourg.", "According to the European Space Agency, the iceberg lost a chunk early, sparking a naming convention where the largest section was renamed from A-68 to A-68A and the smaller piece A-68B.", "A-68A lost another piece in April 2020 (spawning A-68C) and is now about 150km long and 48km wide.

Because most of it is under water, it will project a long way underneath which means it\u2019s easy for it to run aground, and that\u2019s also common.\u201d", "She agreed that depending on where the iceberg ended up it could disrupt the routes that animals used to get to feeding grounds.", "A satellite image of A-68A floating about 230km west-southwest of the South Orkney Islands in Antarctica in April.
