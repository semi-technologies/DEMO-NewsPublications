We\u2019re showering ourselves in champagne. I am the knight, and you, queen of the night.\u201d The balding singer with a stubby moustache and sequined blazer slid across the stage. It was a chilly New Year\u2019s Eve in 2018, but the crowd of 60,000 sang along in the resort town of Zakopane in the foothills of the Tatra mountains. Another 8m Poles watched the public broadcaster\u2019s flagship concert from home, triple the peak viewing figures of its rival television stations.", "Disco polo, a musical genre once relegated to country wedding bandstands, has strutted onto the main stage. Created in rural Poland in the late 1980s, it blends folk tunes with drum machines and synthesisers, often with saucy lyrics. \u201cPolka Dot Knickers\u201d, a hit song in 1995, offended many sensibilities. But the genre has bounced back. Almost two-thirds of Poles\u2014and 80% of them in rural areas\u2014say they enjoy it. \u201cLove in Zakopane\u201d has had 226m views on YouTube.", "Disco polo bands now perform at venues such as Warsaw\u2019s Palace of Culture and Science and London\u2019s O 2 Arena. In September a school in Michalowo, in eastern Poland, launched the country\u2019s first class aimed at making a career in disco polo. This year\u2019s inaugural class of 27 highschoolers is coached in singing and dancing, and learns the technicalities of sound systems. The minister of education at the time commended it: \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll catch on.\u201d The town is building a disco-polo museum.", "Polish politicians have long sucked up to disco-polo fans. Back in the presidential campaign of 1995, the two frontrunners were both backed by disco-polo artists. But the patronage afforded to musicians under the ruling Law and Justice party is quite new. Earlier this year TVP , Poland\u2019s public broadcaster, released a hagiography of the disco-polo doyen, Zenek Martyniuk. After singing along at one of his concerts, the station\u2019s boss, a Law and Justice politician, said it was time to end \u201cthe hypocrisy and pretence that this is an inferior genre\u201d."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["zakopane", "populist", "sneer", "pop", "rural", "music", "town", "singing", "poland", "fear", "genre", "stage", "polish", "polo", "public", "discopolo", "politicians"], "pubDate": "2020-11-28T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
