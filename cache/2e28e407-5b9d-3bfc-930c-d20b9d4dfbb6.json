Described by Reid as a \u201cWakanda Forever meets Game of Thrones\u201d moment, it conveyed power. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve actually worn before,\u201d says Reid, who asked her daughter for input before making a selection. \u201cI wanted to wear something powerful but fun. I wore sneakers because I [knew] I was probably going to be there all night.\u201d The outfit was discussed heavily on social media, another new aspect of the job. \u201cI\u2019ll get everything from what color is that lipstick to what is the brand you\u2019re wearing,\u201d says Reid of the feedback she receives on Twitter and Instagram. \u201cAnd I get tons of feedback on my hair\u2014which I can\u2019t take credit for. I have a woman named Gisele Modeste who is a great friend and also happens to style my hair.\u201d", "It was only a decade or so ago when seeing a Black woman with natural hair reporting the news was a rarity. With hair now protected by The Crown Act, a petition to end race-based hair discrimination passed by the House of Representatives in 2019 which is now law in states like New York, Colorado, and California, regressive standards are less prevalent. \u201cThere was a time when it was frowned upon, particularly to wear your hair in natural curls, an afro, or braids,\u201d says Reid. \u201cNot just in media but throughout [society]. In my twenties, I was told by a woman at a temp agency that she didn\u2019t want to even send me out on interviews because my hair was in braids. They felt it wasn\u2019t professional. It\u2019s a recent development that we\u2019re seeing anchors, analysts, and correspondents\u2019s natural hair.\u201d", "Reid likens the scrutiny and interest in the way female anchors dress and present themselves to the media attention devoted to the outfits of politicians like Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris. \u201cEither Hillary\u2019s suits were considered too boxy, too short, or too long. Every hair change was discussed,\u201d says Reid. \u201cShe was the poster child for being beaten up about fashion and constantly scrutinized. Kamala Harris has it double because she\u2019s a woman of color. She even gets picked on for her laugh, just these silly stupid things that have nothing to do with her qualifications as a prosecutor, Senator, and former Attorney General.\u201d Still, Reid thinks Harris has found ways to use fashion to her advantage. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful woman and can be glamorous when she wants to, but she\u2019s also capable of looking like she could be at your weekend red wine party! So she\u2019s been using [clothing] in a brilliant way on the trail.\u201d", "With the election results still pending and related coverage likely to dominate the news cycle the remainder of the month, Reid hopes that the extended wait gives her audience a moment to reflect on the issues that led to such a close race. There\u2019s a bigger lesson to be gleaned from this election no matter who gets elected. \u201cEven among some people who don\u2019t consider themselves racist, there is a core antipathy to what many conservatives deride as \u201cwoke culture,\u201d which just means the increasing prevalence of multiculturalism and inclusion in our multiracial country,\u201d she says. \u201cApparently, for tens of millions of Americans, even the risk of COVID-19 sickness and death can\u2019t overcome the drive to go back to \u201cpre-woke\u201d culture. Those forces are obviously stronger than what shows up in any of the polls, and are even more powerful motivators than a deadly pandemic.\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["vote", "natural", "hair", "woman", "media", "dressing", "harris", "election", "wore", "way", "shes", "wear", "2020s", "unprecedented", "night", "joy", "reid", "tv"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
