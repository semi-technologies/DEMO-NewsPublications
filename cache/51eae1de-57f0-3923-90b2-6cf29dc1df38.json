Four years ago, Barry Blitt aced the task, producing an image that, in a polarized country, could resonate with most any American. In The New Yorker\u2019s latest issue, he pulls a similar trick, nodding only to what we already know: that many people are eager to vote, and that those who didn\u2019t mail their ballots have often been spending hours in line to cast them. We recently talked to Blitt about how he\u2019s preparing himself for the results.", "What are your plans to get through Election Night\u2014or Election Month, as the case may be?", "I can tell you that two of the most disappointing Election Nights for me\u20142000 and 2016\u2014were spent at friends\u2019 election parties. So, even without a pandemic, I\u2019d be spending this one locked in the house. I may even need to spend all of November in my room.", "If Donald Trump is voted out of office, do you think that\u2014as a cartoonist\u2014you may end up missing him?", "I will not miss him, certainly not as a cartoonist. I\u2019ve drawn him too many times, and spent too much time wringing obvious jokes out of him. I actually found him sort of amusing before he became President, but he ruined our relationship forever by getting into politics.", "Do you have political posters or images or artists that you turn to for inspiration?", "I do like going through really old political cartoons\u2014by Thomas Rowlandson and George Cruikshank, in particular. Usually, I rifle through their drawings once I\u2019ve worked out an idea, looking for some kind of inspiration about inking and color. So far, they don\u2019t seem to be getting through to me, but I\u2019m still hopeful.", "Which President or political figure do you think was the best target for artists and cartoonists?", "Oh, every President is a big, fat target. I don\u2019t think Biden has been ripped into enough, owing to the comparative awfulness of his opponent, but if he actually wins he\u2019ll be ripe for attack from many angles. I\u2019d look forward to it.", "For more political covers, see below:"], "authors": ["Fran\u00e7oise Mouly", "Fran\u00e7oise Moul", "Barry Blit"], "keywords": ["blitts", "line", "barry", "president", "target", "ive", "political", "getting", "spending", "think", "america", "spent", "id", "election"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
