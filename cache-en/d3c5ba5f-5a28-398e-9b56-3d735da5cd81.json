A phrase in Portuguese spray-painted on a wall: \u201cBlack women are the revolution.\u201d", "Bom Mesmo \u00c9 Estar Debaixo D\u2019\u00c1gua (It\u2019s Really Good to Be Underwater), replete with references to Afro-Brazilian religion, Black feminism, love, revenge and celebration, is one of the most rapturously reviewed albums in her country this year. \u201cIt\u2019s an album that talks about me, that is about me,\u201d she says over a video call, \u201cbut I also bring other voices and images of Black women. Because it is an \u2018I\u2019 that is an \u2018us\u2019, that is collective.\u201d", "The phrase \u201cBlack women are the revolution\u201d appears during the ominous, bass-led Ain\u2019t I a Woman, whose title is also the name of the book by Black feminist writer bell hooks and originally comes from an 1851 speech by former enslaved woman Sojourner Truth. \u201cbell hooks said that love heals, and I\u2019m bringing the perspective of healing to this record,\u201d Luna says, asserting that Black women \u201cneed to claim and have the right to love and be loved\u201d.", "That right is hard fought in Brazil. Three days after this interview, on the eve of Brazil\u2019s Black Consciousness Day holiday, Jo\u00e3o \u201cBeto\u201d Freitas, a Black man, was beaten and asphyxiated to death by security guards outside a Carrefour supermarket. His family called the killing \u201cracist\u201d and it was widely condemned in Brazil. As protests broke out at Carrefour supermarkets in Brazilian cities, Eduardo Bolsonaro \u2013 congressman son of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 sneered: \u201cThey got their George Floyd.\u201d", "On the day Freitas was buried, president Bolsonaro addressed the G20 by video, stressed Brazil\u2019s racial diversity and denied the deeply rooted racism that makes Brazil\u2019s Black majority poorer, and more likely to die of Covid-19, be unemployed, killed, imprisoned or shot dead by police. S\u00e9rgio Camargo, his choice to head Brazil\u2019s leading Black culture and history foundation, has called Black rights movements \u201cscum\u201d and said slavery was \u201cbeneficial\u201d.", "\u201cThis false idea, this fallacy of racial democracy is old,\u201d Luna says. Relaxing on a sofa, she is warm, keenly intelligent and eager to talk about racism and politics under Bolsonaro, who she describes as an \u201caberration\u201d and relic of Brazil\u2019s brutal colonial past. \u201cWe have all the data that confirms and statistically proves that Brazil is a racist country,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are a country that was built on slavery.\u201d", "Her first album, 2019\u2019s Um Corpo No Mundo (A Body in the World), was named after the dislocated feeling of being a \u201cBlack woman of the diaspora, in a country where we don\u2019t see ourselves represented.\u201d The tracks on her new album were partly made on her third visit to Africa \u2013 which felt like a homecoming for Luna, who was pregnant with her son Dayo during recording and filming. Recorded in Nairobi and S\u00e3o Paulo with Kenyan producer and jazz guitarist Kato Change, it is richly melodic, elegantly percussive, jazzy, contemporary and drenched in Brazilian culture; Luna\u2019s voice swings from quietly assured to forceful and soaring, her lyrics clinical and poetic.", "Luedji Luna.", "Luna was born Luedji Santa Rita in Salvador, capital of the north-eastern state of Bahia (the city with the highest proportion of Black people in Brazil), where she grew up in its blue-collar Brotas neighbourhood. Her parents met in its Black rights movement. Their home was filled with music, but Luna\u2019s parents wanted her to have a steady job, so she graduated in law.", "Words had provided an escape from the bullying Luna experienced as a teenager, \u201cone of the few Black girls in a private school, very shy, very silent. And writing came to break this silence,\u201d she says. \u201cThis writing became music.\u201d", "Also deeply unhappy after university, she practised yoga and meditation, realised she wanted to sing, and spent wages earned as a court intern on singing lessons. She moved to S\u00e3o Paulo and fell in with film-makers such as Joyce Prado, who directed the 23-minute film version of the full album in Salvador and the video to her contagious 2017 breakthrough hit Banho de Folha. \u201cIn Salvador, it\u2019s who you know,\u201d she said. \u201cHere in S\u00e3o Paulo, you need to be good.\u201d", "Black Brazilians are expected to sing about hunger, pain, hunger, sadness. But we can sing other things, too", "Visually and musically, there are allusions to Candombl\u00e9, the Afro-Brazilian religion Luna follows, imported and developed by enslaved Africans. It is a tolerant, subjective religion whose deities are also forces of nature. Worshippers celebrate during overnight ceremonies, driven by hypnotic percussion, where they are taken over by deities. Each worshipper has a patron saint, or \u201corix\u00e1\u201d and the album opens with a song and rhythm dedicated to Luna\u2019s, called Bess\u00e9m or Oxumar\u00e9, sometimes represented by a rainbow or a snake.", "Intertwined with the birth of samba in Rio and carnival \u2013 both of which it predates \u2013 Candombl\u00e9 is present in the works of Brazilian musicians such as Gilberto Gil and Dorival Caymmi. But its followers increasingly come under attack from extremists among Brazil\u2019s growing number of evangelical Christians, many of whom support Bolsonaro and see Candombl\u00e9 as diabolic. Luna hopes to \u201cdemystify, stop it becoming demonised\u201d, something she wants to do for Black Brazilians more broadly, too.", "\u201cWe\u2019re expected to sing about hunger, pain, hunger, sadness. But we can sing other things. We live other things, too. That\u2019s why I talk about love, to escape this stereotype, this expectation of pain when you think about a Black woman,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m talking about love as healing. I\u2019m talking about love as power.\u201d", "\u2022 Bom Mesmo \u00c9 Estar Debaixo D\u2019\u00c1gua is out now."], "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "keywords": ["voice", "sing", "statistically", "love", "salvador", "luedji", "bahia", "bold", "bolsonaro", "country", "racist", "brazil", "album", "woman", "women", "black", "brazils", "luna"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
