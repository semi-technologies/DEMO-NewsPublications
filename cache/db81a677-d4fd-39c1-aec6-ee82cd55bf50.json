{"paragraphs": ["Our deepest thanks to everybody that watches, listens to, or reads any of Game Informer's content... and thanks for checking out this bizarre episode of The Game Informer Show. By now you might have heard that there were recently seven wonderful people laid off at Game Informer, so we begin the show with Andy McNamara filling us in on the state of the company. After that, the conversation gets more uplifting as we talk about Death Stranding and the afterlife of Oninaki. After some wonderfully sweet community emails, we're joined by the creator of Magic: The Gathering Richard Garfield and Jeopardy super-champion Ken Jennings to talk about their upcoming trivia game Half Truth. Thanks again for all of the support throughout the years.", "You can watch the video above, subscribe and listen to the audio on iTunes or Google Play, listen on SoundCloud, stream it on Spotify, or download the MP3 at the bottom of the page.
