These included a lethal reluctance to conduct caesarean sections; a tendency to blame mothers for problems; a failure to handle complex cases; a lack of consultant oversight; and a \u201cdeeply worrying lack of kindness and compassion\u201d.", "The review includes a series of immediate actions and \u201cmust do\u201d recommendations for all hospital trusts to improve maternity safety \u201cat pace\u201d. These include formal risk assessment at every antenatal contact, twice-daily consultant-led maternity ward rounds, women and family advocates on the board of every NHS trust, and the appointment of dedicated lead midwives and obstetricians.", "The independent review by a team led by midwifery expert Donna Ockenden, uncovered 1,862 serious incidents including hundreds of baby deaths and an unusually high number of maternal deaths, mostly between 2000 and 2019.", "In June West Mercia police launched an investigation into the worst of the cases.", "A clinical review of a selection of 250 of the cases prompted Ockenden to outline Thursday\u2019s emerging findings report so that action can be taken now before the full report is completed. When completed the review is likely to be the largest in NHS history.", "\u201cWe owe it to the 1,862 families who are contributing to this review to bring about rapid positive and sustainable change across the maternity services at SaTH,\u201d said the interim report.", "It calls for 27 local actions for learning and seven immediate and essential actions for all maternity services \u201cto be implemented now and at pace\u201d.", "Other recommendations include greater oversight of maternity care by senior doctors, ring-fenced funding for maternity training and the development of regional specialists in maternal medicine.", "The failings identified at SaTH typify mounting concerns about the safety and potentially avoidable deaths at other maternity services.

And whilst no one wants to feel fear and be disempowered through angst, everyone deserves openness and the accessible information to help them make an informed choice.", "\u201cIn terms of midwifery, there is a culture of normal birth at any cost. This has pervaded for decades. It comes from the ideology behind current midwife training. That has to change.\u201d", "Nadine Dorries, the health minister responsible for patient safety and maternity, said: \u201cI expect the trust to act upon the recommendations immediately, and for the wider maternity service right across the country to consider important actions they can take to improve safety for mothers, babies and families.", "\u201cThis government is utterly committed to patient safety, eradicating avoidable harms and making the NHS the safest place in the world to give birth.
