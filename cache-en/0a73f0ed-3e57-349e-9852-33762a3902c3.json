With a plethora of popular events - like the recent Galactus battle - to bonus cosmetics, Fortnite's playerbase always has new content to explore and enjoy. A new update, however, optimized the popular battle royale's framerate on next-gen consoles. Fortnite already runs in 4K and 60 FPS on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but now the 120FPS Mode, which can be enabled in the video settings tab, enhances the moment-to-moment action that the game is known for.", "120FPS Mode, however, takes a toll on Fortnite's resolution. If you've been enjoying the game in 4K, you'll have to make due with 1440p if you plan on amplifying the framerate. Additionally, shadows, post-processing, and streaming distances will be noticeably reduced. According to The Verge, the Xbox Series S locks in at 1080p if the 120FPS Mode is switched on. And if you're playing Fortnite on a monitor - the best way to play competitive shooters in my honest opinion! - 120FPS Mode will only be compatible with 120Hz displays.", "Fortnite's 120FPS Mode is available right now.
