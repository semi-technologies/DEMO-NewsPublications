It provides insight and explanations in a crisis that affects every one of us \u2013 but is it healthy to consume so much?", "When she found herself still scrolling through news stories at two in the morning, art student Rose Brouwer, 25, decided it was high time she stopped for a while. She\u2019d always been interested in current affairs, but now she was sitting at home all day, it was getting too much. \u201cThis is a historic moment, and it\u2019s my way of dealing with it,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a member of the public, I want to be up to date with what the government is doing.\u201d", "Brouwers is far from alone: we\u2019ve become a nation of news junkies. It\u2019s not often that a press conference by the prime minister attracts 7.5 million viewers, or that the media gets so much attention: the number of visitors to newspaper websites has doubled. But is binging on news good for us?", "RTL Nieuws reporter Koen de Regt thinks not. Two weeks ago, he tweeted: \u201cMy tip: stop obsessively following the news, and leave it to journalists.\u201d", "To Het Parool, he adds: \u201cThat was also kind of a reprimand to myself, because I was following the corona news obsessively.\u201d The difference between this crisis and previous events, he points out, is that we can\u2019t shut this one out of our homes \u2013 unlike, say, 9/11 or the Turkish Airlines crash at Schiphol in 2009.", "\u201cYou keep your distance when you\u2019re outdoors, and you wash your hands when you come home,\u201d De Regt says. \u201cIt\u2019s on your mind all the time.\u201d He believes journalists cope better with a bombardment of news than people who aren\u2019t involved with it on a daily basis. \u201cI would say to people, don\u2019t drive yourself crazy.\u201d", "Pessimism", "Mark Boukes, Assistant Professor of Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam, says hard news about the number of deaths or the crisis in intensive care, also affects our expectations of the future. The two go hand in hand. Too much hard news can adversely affect your view of how things are going to turn out. \u201cIf your goal is to live a happy life, it\u2019s hard to square this with a barrage of bad news.\u201d", "According to Suzie Geurtsen, of the behavioural psychology consultancy Dijksterhuis & Van Baaren, the emphasis on negativity is an evolutionary trait. \u201cOur brains are more focused on the negative, which is why the news is mainly about things that are going badly: it\u2019s what people are interested in.\u201d", "Partly because of this, Boukes says journalists need to create balanced content. His research has found that soft news, which offers a more personal slant on world events, puts people in a more positive mood.", "Het Parool editor Ronald Ockhuysen says that his readers have a particular need for pieces that provide insight and explanation, and says: \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing the public returning to reliable, traditional TV and newspaper brands.\u201d", "Winfried Baijens, presenter of the NOS Journaal, agrees. \u201cMy friends and family have rarely shown so much interest in my work, even in WhatsApp groups.\u201d He admits that his own average screen time has increased from seven to nine hours a day.", "Constant stress", "Ockhuysen says news is best left to the specialists, and recognises the concerns of RTL reporter De Regt. \u201cYou drift from one story to another out of angst or curiosity, but eventually it all just gets too much and you risk drowning in a sea of information.\u201d", "Geurtsen, the behavioural psychologist, says that watching news creates a stress response. \u201cSome stress is good for your body, because it warns you against danger. But having stress all the time is bad for your health.\u201d", "For this reason, Amsterdam photographer Tom Elst, 55, hardly follows the news anymore. \u201cI used to watch talk shows all the time, but I lost interest because they were all about one subject.\u201d He now ignores the news on days when he\u2019s working, and says: \u201cIt\u2019s such a wonderful relaxing feeling.\u201d", "But supposing news is your job? NOS presenter Baijens says he has a permanent filter that puts everything in context: \u201cI\u2019ve probably developed this over the years because I\u2019m always up to my neck in news.\u201d Two weeks ago he presented a special programme on the facts and fiction of the coronavirus. \u201cIt obviously met a huge need, because we got tens of thousands of emails.\u201d", "On one day recently, 7.5 million people in the Netherlands visited the NOS website. \u201cOur role is gradually shifting away from traditional journalism and towards informing the public about medical and scientific issues,\u201d Baijens says. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever experienced before.\u201d", "Going to the beach", "The media have an important role to play in behavioural change, says Suzie Geurtsen, the psychologist. For example, they try not to devote too much coverage to people who still go to the beach, because it gives the impression that a majority are doing this. That\u2019s not the message you want to convey, because there\u2019s a risk that people will copy this behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s much better to put the emphasis on the desirable course of action.\u201d", "RTL\u2019s Koen de Regt has found a solution to stress: he logged off Twitter for an entire weekend. \u201cI find now that if I go for an hour without thinking about the coronavirus, I think: wow, I actually managed without it.\u201d He also recommends switching off push notifications on your phone if they make you anxious.", "Tom Elst, the photographer, has a different approach. His wife still sometimes switches on Jinek, the current affairs chatshow, in the evenings. \u201cWhen she does, I just go to bed with a book.\u201d"], "authors": ["Tahrim Ramdjan"], "keywords": ["nos", "baijens", "healthy", "weeks", "public", "need", "corona", "binge", "behavioural", "regt", "hard", "crisis", "stress"], "pubDate": "2020-04-14T09:33:35+02:00", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
