Maybe we should be looking at cats instead.\u201d \u2014the Washington Post", "Everyone wants to know how I, as First Cat-elect, get along with Joe and Jill\u2019s German shepherds, Champ and Major. I like the boys. Yes, their names skew a little Deutsches Jungvolk-y to my ear. And, yes, as soon as we move to D.C., they are likely to colonize every square inch of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in a zealous but disorganized juggernaut of dogspreading. But, in so doing, Champ and Major will open up a space for me. A quieter space, a more thoughtful space\u2014a space for me to coat with stray hair and vomit.", "Look, being First Pet is no box of chocolates. I\u2019m not there yet, but, honey, I know, I already know. My test for any aspiring diplo-cats is to ask them to identify the Monroe Doctrine, Shirley Chisholm, and any reason to think they\u2019ll still be friends with Lindsey Graham or Susan Collins by the end of this Administration. If they can do that, then . . . maybe. Otherwise, I just can\u2019t even. Sorry, little Kansas City calico with Pamela Harriman on the brain, but I\u2019m fresh out of fucks\u2014heavy lifting ahead.", "I mean, let\u2019s be real here, the culture of unrealistic expectations for governmental felines was firmly established by that consummate top-feeding suck-up, Socks Clinton. He would sit on Forty-Two\u2019s shoulders. His carrier had the Presidential seal. He schmoozed Bill\u2019s personal secretary. He was so popular that the White House had to tell photographers to leave him alone.", "In short, Barf City. Truman Capote, but with more dander. \u201cAcross the aisle\u201d does not begin to describe the largesse with which I would like to dispense my regurgitative splendors on the Socks legacy.", "No, I\u2019m more likely to take my cues from Gerald Ford\u2019s family cat, Shan. Remember when the Fords all toddled off for a ski vacation in Vail without him? On their return, Shan saw fit to bite the First Lady and one of the First Daughters on the leg. Now, that\u2019s the kind of self-respecting behavior that I can really get behind. Simple, direct communication for the win. Everyone understands the meaning of a bite on the leg. The meaning is \u201cno.\u201d", "As for those naysayers who doubt the very need for a feline on the Hill, let me simply reiterate some of the names associated with the new Admin: Biden, Blinken, Yellen. We\u2019ve already got very strong reindeer energy, guys. Let\u2019s diversify.", "My work lies before me. My first plan of action is to deal with the sparkly drifts of tinsel and glitter that Melania left behind. They\u2019re so triggering. They terrify and delight me. Some rooms look like a disco ball\u2019s bladder has burst. This must be dealt with. As a counterpoint to this exhausting sensory onslaught, I will also give myself over to the urgent and ongoing matters of stepping on Joe\u2019s keyboard and sitting in any open suitcase or empty box that I encounter.", "Then comes my campaign proper. In this era of term clarification, I think it\u2019s time we go after the title \u201cFirst Pet.\u201d A little pervy, no? Granted, I realize that, as problems go, this one fairly screams First World, but living in a gilded cage is no reason not to make that cage a more beautiful and progressive place. A place that doesn\u2019t recall your best friend\u2019s finished basement one Saturday night in the eighth grade.", "Which brings me to the larger work at hand. The other day, some wise-cracking human on Twitter wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t worry about how much I talk to my cat in my Retired Nineteenth-Century Sea Captain voice. I worry about how much I talk to him in my normal voice.\u201d Which made me think: Us pets are kind of blank screens for humans to project their anxieties and dreams onto, no? The caretaking goes in two directions. So we\u2019ve gotta remain nonjudgmental. And we\u2019ve gotta continue to mirror a human\u2019s sense of privilege by regularly jumping on our owners\u2019 genitals and then expecting to be fed.", "I\u2019ve already started to get hate mail from the canine equivalent of Proud Boys. Those Doberbitches. Zero ability to construct an argument. Worse, their spelling is terrible\u2014a mastiff in Albuquerque wants to \u201cbrake all ateteen\u201d of my \u201ctose.\u201d But, when they go low, I go even lower\u2014right under the bed. I\u2019m under the bed in the guest room in Greenville. Here, in the comforting grip of darkness, I\u2019m girding my loins for January 20th. I\u2019ve heaped all my chew toys into a kind of Toltec burial mound. Me and the chews are down here, as far back as possible. Beneath the headboard.
