These are the things that these very same people say that they're frustrated with when they see from never Trump or conservative establishment, they say, oh, they always seem to think they're winning by losing. You don't win by losing and you don't win by giving your opponents everything they want, which is raw power. And so people I actually think most I think most people are actually quite sensible about this. They do want Republicans all fighting for election integrity. That's that's obviously going to be the major issue of the next few years. And that needs to be an all hands on deck kind of situation. But I don't think smart. Rational people think that the key is to lose. That's the whole thing that they've been frustrated with in the GOP establishment. They should not emulate that if they're genuinely frustrated by that.\"", "Listen To The Full Interview Below:"], "authors": ["Wyatt Dobrovichfago"], "keywords": ["runoffs", "push", "think", "win", "mollie", "dont", "thats", "theyre", "voting", "hemingway", "ga", "frustrated", "thing", "legitimate", "senate", "losing"], "pubDate": "2020-12-03T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
