Kapsamat is known for playing her country\u2019s national instrument, the dombra, while in traditional dress. This week, she posted a video of herself playing the long-necked, two-string lute among the snowy mountains of Kolsai Lake, Kazakhstan in a striking green, fur-trimmed robe and a velvet cap embellished with coins, a qasaba, as a nod to her rich heritage.
