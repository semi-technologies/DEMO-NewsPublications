Only we can save us from this current surge.\"", "A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel is scheduled to take up a request Thursday to authorize emergency use of Pfizer's vaccine. Vaccinations could begin just days later, though initial supplies will be rationed, and shots are not expected to become widely available until the spring.", "With the U.S. facing what could be a catastrophic winter, top government officials warned Americans anew to wear masks, practice social distancing and follow other basic measures \u2014 precautions that President Donald Trump and other members of the administration have often disdained.", "\"I hear community members parroting back those situations \u2014 parroting back that masks don't work, parroting back that we should work towards herd immunity, parroting back that gatherings don't result in super-spreading events,\" Birx said. \"And I think our job is to constantly say those are myths, they are wrong and you can see the evidence base.\"", "The virus is blamed for over 280,000 deaths and more than 14.6 million confirmed infections in the U.S. New cases per day have rocketed to an all-time high of more than 190,000 on average.", "Deaths per day have surged to an average of more than 2,160, a level last seen during the dark days in April, when the outbreak was centered around New York. The number of Americans in the hospital with the coronavirus topped 100,000 for the first time over the past few days.", "Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner, warned on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the U.S. death toll could be approaching 400,000 by the end of January.", "\"As bad as things are right now,\" he said, \"they're going to get a lot worse.\"", "In California, the first place to enact a statewide lockdown last spring, new stay-at-home orders were set to take effect Sunday night in Southern California, much of the San Francisco Bay area and other areas.", "CALIFORNIA SHERIFF TELLS NEWSOM COUNTY WON'T BE 'BLACKMAILED, BULLIED, OR USED AS MUSCLE AGAINST' RESIDENTS", "The new rules in the state of 40 million people prohibit residents from gathering with those outside their household. Retailers including supermarkets and shopping centers can operate with just 20% capacity, while restaurant dining, hair salons, movie theaters, museums, and playgrounds must shut down.", "Hospitals in California are seeing space in intensive care units dwindle amid a surge in infections. California health authorities imposed the order after ICU capacity fell below a 15% threshold in some regions.", "Some law enforcement officials, though, said they don't plan to enforce the rules, and some business owners are warning that they could go under after a year of on-and-off closings and other restrictions.", "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he hopes the new lockdown order is the last one he has to issue, declaring the vaccine offers \"light at the end of the tunnel.\"", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that health care workers and nursing home patients get priority when the first shots become available.", "Both Pfizer's vaccine and a Moderna vaccine that will also be reviewed by the FDA later this month require two doses a few weeks apart.
