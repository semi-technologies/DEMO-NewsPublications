In the first three attacks, he targeted couples. The first two murder victims were high school students who were parked in a car on their first date. In attacks on the other two couples, he managed to kill the women, but the men survived. A male San Francisco cab driver was the last known victim.", "During the murder spree, the Zodiac Killer sent media outlets a series of letters taking credit for the slayings.

Each letter also included one-third of a 408-symbol cryptogram that the suspect said would reveal his identity. The killer demanded the papers publish the letters in full or he would kill again.", "A week after the letters were sent, a couple in Salinas, California, cracked the cipher. The Zodiac Killer, the plaintext revealed, said he was collecting slaves for the afterlife and that he wouldn\u2019t disclose his identity because doing so would interfere with those plans.", "In November 1969, after killing the remaining two known victims, the Zodiac Killer sent a letter to The San Francisco Chronicle that included a new puzzle. The cryptogram was known as the Z-340, or simply the 340, because it contained 340 characters in it.", "Photograph: Getty Images", "Ever since then, both amateur and professional cryptographers, including those working for the FBI, have worked to crack the cipher.
