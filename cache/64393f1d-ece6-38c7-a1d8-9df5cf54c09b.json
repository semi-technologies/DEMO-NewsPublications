Hessler refers to \u201cleftists\u201d and \u201cfar left\u201d attacks on critics of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official version of events. The usage of these terms may inadvertently confuse Western readers, who perhaps more readily associate the left with positions such as anti-capitalism, anti-discrimination, egalitarianism, social justice and welfare, and workers\u2019 rights. But, in Chinese popular discourse, being on the left denotes fierce nationalism, loyalty to the state, and even deeper loyalty to the Party. Its brand of anti-capitalism is only in opposition to the capitalism of the West, and socialism is whatever the Party says it is. Of course, there are people in China who hold positions that would be more widely understood as belonging to the Western notions of the left or far left, but the more vocal or organized among them are generally silenced. In fact, the suppression of an egalitarian, democratic, workerist left has a long history in the People\u2019s Republic, from the nineteen-fifties to the present. It would be best not to confuse these leftists with the current regime\u2019s most rabid defenders.", "Christopher Connery", "Professor of World Literature and Cultural Studies", "University of California, Santa Cruz", "Revisiting Berryman", "Anthony Lane\u2019s piece about John Berryman provided an enjoyable journey through some of the poet\u2019s best-known work; the new edition of selected letters that Lane reviews seems like an excellent resource (Books, October 19th). However, I was surprised by the casual insult to confessional poetry. Lane notes that Berryman \u201cviewed the notion of his being a confessional poet \u2018with rage and contempt,\u2019 \u201d and states, \u201cAnd rightly so; the label is an insult to his craftsmanship.\u201d Confessional poetry is not universally viewed this way. It has a storied history, and, though it is frequently spoken of today as a feminine mode, it was pursued by both male and female poets, including Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, and Robert Lowell, all of whom contributed to the rise of \u201cconfessionalism\u201d in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. It is not a style that, in Lane\u2019s words, pines \u201cfor mere self-expression\u201d; rather, it is a complex poetic movement, and the post-confessional and neo-confessional strains remain extremely important to contemporary poets. Confessional poetry is no less worthy than other poetic styles\u2014nor does its common association with women\u2019s self-expression imply that it is somehow easier to write or to analyze.", "Leanna Petronella", "Austin, Texas", "I want to thank Lane for his wonderful article about John Berryman, which brought back memories of my time as a psychiatrist (and poet) in training. In the mid-nineteen-seventies, I became fascinated with Berryman, who had died a few years earlier, and other poets from the era who experienced severe mental illness. I once flew to San Francisco and presented a paper that was partly about a documentary entitled \u201cI Don\u2019t Think I Will Sing Any More Just Now,\u201d showing footage of Berryman near the end of his life. On the flight home, I was inspired to write a poem about Berryman\u2019s death. Studying the lives and works of poets such as Berryman allowed me to better understand the torment in the minds of my patients, much more effectively than simply reading Freud or a textbook would have; I have also seen some patients turn to poetry as a way to explore the suffering and trauma in their lives.", "H.
