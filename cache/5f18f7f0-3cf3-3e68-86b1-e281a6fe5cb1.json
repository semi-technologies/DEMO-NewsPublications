Recent reports by the National Academy of Medicine have urged the use of operations management and information technology methods to improve the quality of care and efficiency in hospitals. Healthcare applications of operations management theory and tools have become a thriving field, both in academia and in industry.", "Outpatient services account for more than 80% of patient care in the United States, and most patients access these services via appointment systems. One central challenge in the management of healthcare operations is to match capacity and demand for outpatient services under variability and unpredictability. From an operational standpoint, a good appointment system strikes the right balance between efficient resource utilization and contained patients' waiting times. Outpatient clinics often face various sources of variability that disrupt their daily operations, and which add layers of complexity to the appointment scheduling problem. For example, there is variability and seasonality in the daily demand for outpatient care, it is common for patients to not show up for their scheduled services, patients who show up are not necessarily punctual, consultation times are stochastic, and unscheduled emergency patients may need to be seen by their provider in a short notice.", "In this seminar, we will discuss strategies for managing patient flow in outpatient clinics via a well-designed appointment system.
