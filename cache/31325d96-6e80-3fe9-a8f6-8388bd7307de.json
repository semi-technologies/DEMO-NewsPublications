talking to myself.", "You wanna say to the person next to you, like,", "Are you fucking seeing this?", "This is the most insane,", "as if things hadn't been weird enough", "getting us to this point.",

infuse that with what I think is more of a character.", "So I think the times that I've felt successful", "at any sort of impression is just finding a character.", "Because once I make that person, real person,", "into a character, then I can create a language for them.", "And once I have a language for them,", "then I can, then it all just tumbles out.", "Natasha, do you do any political impressions?", "I feel like you could do a good Bernie Sanders.", "Hey, wait a minute!
