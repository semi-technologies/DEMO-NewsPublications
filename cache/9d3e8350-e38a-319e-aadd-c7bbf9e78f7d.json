Back in mid-March, I remember balking at the prospect of spending two whole weeks cooped up with my husband in our 700 square foot, air shaft-adjacent one bedroom. Little did I know, those two weeks would eventually stretch into 28\u2014and counting.", "I know, I know. Woe is me, employed and working from the comfort of my own home! But even as I made peace with the seeming permanence of my new situation, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to invest in a suitable home office setup. The idea of cluttering what little space I had with an unsightly standing desk felt like admitting that the pandemic had won, and that the fugue state in which so many of us were existing was here to stay.", "Instead, I carted my laptop from the dining table to the couch and back again, charging cords draped perilously across the room.

Once I got over the belief that \u201cwork\u201d chairs must swivel, I started looking for dining chairs that were similar to those I already owned, but with a taller backrest that would help prevent slouching. With an 18.5\u201d backrest, these Article chairs have helped improve my posture without disrupting the look and feel of my space.", "Svelti Grano Fawn Beige Dining Chair $79 ARTICLE Shop Now", "A Posture-Saving Laptop Stand", "Experts have said that staring at our own reflections on Zoom can negatively impact our self-image. And while I can\u2019t say I\u2019ll ever enjoy the sensation of watching myself speak in real-time, this foldable, 5-in-1 laptop stand has at least helped bring my virtual coworkers up to eye level.", "MOFT Invisible Thin Sit-Stand Desk $60 AMAZON Shop Now", "A Flexible Lighting Scheme", "Speaking of Zoom, these bulbs have saved me from many an unflattering shadow in my light-starved apartment.
