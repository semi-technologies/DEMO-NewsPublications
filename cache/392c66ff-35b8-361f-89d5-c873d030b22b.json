In she bustled \u2013 she\u2019s smaller than me (I\u2019m 5ft 1in), older than me (she\u2019s 60), a little eccentric and perhaps the friendliest person in the place. She didn\u2019t stop talking. She ushered me out, remained by my side until the ceremony started (think Disney\u2019s Fairy Godmother) and, along the way, mentioned that she was the founder and CEO of Starling Bank, the event\u2019s main sponsor.", "I couldn\u2019t have been more surprised \u2013 or picture a less likely \u201cbanking mogul\u201d. When she explained that Starling was an app-based bank, I rewarded her with the worst response possible. \u201cYou mean like Monzo?\u201d (My daughter had signed up to Monzo, the trendy \u201cno branches\u201d bank, to acquire its distinctive coral-coloured card, which now gathers dust on her bookshelf.) Boden was gracious but flustered. I ascertained that Monzo had been founded by her former business partner Tom Blomfield. He was considerably younger, more hip, more Hoxton \u2013 and he\u2019d left her, taking the other directors with him.", "Back then, it wasn\u2019t something she discussed in depth \u2013 though financial journalists always asked her about it. Now, though, she has written the whole gory story in a \u201cbusiness tell-all\u201d, a banking blockbuster \u2013 however unlikely that sounds. It\u2019s the tale of a 50-something woman who wants to create a new kind of bank, but needs many millions of pounds just to get started. It takes her two years, but in 2017 she gets there. Her bank, Starling, has won Best British Bank at the British Bank Awards for the past three years. It was the only challenger bank to get through 2020 bigger and stronger than it had been at the start \u2013 and it\u2019s on course to become profitable by December. This year, Boden was invited on to the UK Finance Board and the Government\u2019s Board of Trade. She\u2019s a shot in the arm for super-chatty, middle-aged women everywhere.", "When we meet to discuss her book, Banking On It, Boden\u2019s chosen venue is near Starling\u2019s head office in Southampton, a spa caf\u00e9 where men and women dressed in white bath robes chill out between treatments. Boden is standing near the door, waving wildly.", "\u2018Fintech start-ups are all young white guys with goatees \u2013 usually with rich parents, too\u2019: Anne Boden. Photograph: Michael Clement/The Observer", "She\u2019s well aware she doesn\u2019t conform to any banking stereotype. \u201cI\u2019m a woman. I\u2019m 5ft tall. I\u2019m Welsh. I\u2019m middle-aged. I\u2019m from a very ordinary background and I\u2019m the sort of person who\u2019ll chat to somebody in the ladies!\u201d she says. \u201cFintech start-ups are all young white guys with goatees \u2013 usually with rich parents. People did think I was crazy, that no one \u2018starts a bank\u2019, especially people who looked like me, but I\u2019d reached the stage where I was prepared to fail. I was 54 and confident enough not to care if somebody said I was stupid.\u201d", "Boden grew up in Swansea, the only child of older than average, devoted parents who supported her in whatever she did and gave her an unlimited budget to spend at the bookstore. It all went on nonfiction as Boden was fascinated by science, biographies and how the world worked.", "\u201cMy father worked for British Steel, my mother in the local department store,\u201d says Boden. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone who worked in an office, but I did well in school, studied computer science at Swansea and ended up in London working for Lloyds.\u201d This kickstarted a corporate career that culminated with a move to Dublin in 2012 to join Allied Irish Banks as group chief operating officer.", "Here, she began to reimagine banking. The 2008 credit crunch had devastated Ireland, banks had been seen as largely to blame but, four years on, both there and back home they had returned to business as usual, largely unchanged. \u201cTechnology had transformed how we shop, how we holiday, how we live, but banking was stuck in the past, pretending it hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d Boden began to picture a new kind of bank. \u201cI knew a lot less about industry disruptors than I know now, but I understood that they worked by putting power back in the hands of the consumer,\u201d she says. She wanted (and ultimately created) a bank without the bureaucracy, where opening an account took minutes not weeks, which delivered instant spending notifications and insights (so customers can see how much goes on rent or coffees or late-night Ubers) and helps them set and reach saving goals. With Boden\u2019s bank, cheques could be deposited with just a photo, there would be a handy card-lock facility for the moments customers mislaid their cards, there\u2019d be 24-hour support \u2013 but no branches.", "In the UK, just 1% of venture capital goes to all-female teams", "Is there any harder start-up than a bank? The sums required are astronomical, the regulation and red tape incredibly stringent and the big banks take care of 85% of the nation\u2019s bank accounts. What\u2019s more, Boden knew her face didn\u2019t fit. \u201cFintech is first about finance and there are hardly any women in that,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a boardroom of 20 people, there might be two women, often from another country.\u201d (Boden has a theory that the surprising number of foreign female executives on FTSE boards is down to company bosses feeling more comfortable with women who don\u2019t sound like their wife or mother.)", "\u201cThen you\u2019ve got technology,\u201d she continues, \u201cand there are hardly any women in tech either. Those that are tend to be in marketing roles. When you put that together with entrepreneurship, there are very, very few women fintech entrepreneurs.\u201d In the UK, just 1% of venture capital goes to all-female-founded teams. \u201cI understood how it worked, but there was nothing I could do to change me. I just had to pretend it wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d", "Armed with decades of experience and a colossal volume of research, Boden left her job in 2014 and returned to the UK. She bought a terraced house in Marlow (no connections drew her to the place except a childhood memory of a \u201cgorgeous caravan park\u201d. She still hasn\u2019t fully unpacked.) With no office and no business card, Boden chased meeting upon meeting, trying to sell her vision. \u201cI\u2019d start each morning in a coffee shop sending emails, \u201cI\u2019m Anne, I\u2019m starting a bank. Will you help me?\u2019\u201d She doesn\u2019t sugar-coat this. The pressure was \u201cunbelievable\u201d, deep down, she felt like she was \u201cbegging\u201d. She amassed hundreds of rejections. How did she cope? \u201cBy sending more emails, creating more opportunities,\u201d she says, \u201cand also reading biographies of successful entrepreneurs, especially ones who had almost failed.\u201d After about eight months of solid effort, she succeeded in persuading some top firms to undertake a huge amount of work \u2013 legal, regulatory, branding \u2013 on a contingency fee arrangement, stacking up more than \u00a31m in debt. She also recruited a small team, including Tom Blomfield, who had called her up (their paths had crossed before) and become chief technology officer (CTO).", "Boden was keenly aware of the differences between them. Blomfield, young, bearded and casually dressed, was straight out of start-up central casting. He\u2019d launched his first business, Boso.com, an eBay for students, when still at Oxford. What frustrated Boden was that no one could see further than this odd contrast. In her book, she describes a trip to the US where the pair attempted to raise investment, but were met with puzzled faces. (Boden\u2019s picture of Silicon Valley as seen through her eyes is highly entertaining. The \u201cyoung people in high fashionwear\u201d milling around the \u201cdreaded table tennis tables\u201d, perfecting the art of \u201clooking wildly busy, yet supremely relaxed.\u201d)", "Ultimately, she and Blomfield were driven apart by their different attitudes to investment opportunities. Great tension arose when Boden ended talks with one interested investment company after learning that a founder had pleaded guilty to a serious crime. They then secured an offer elsewhere, but it fell apart over the issue of contingency fees owed.", "If there\u2019s a disco in the office or music somewhere, I\u2019m always first on the dancefloor", "Blomfield resigned and, within days, the small team they\u2019d built had gone with him. I ask how this felt. It\u2019s the only time Boden stops smiling. She\u2019s still and quiet. \u201cI never thought it would actually happen to me,\u201d she says, haltingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it. I was shocked. Perhaps I should have been on my guard, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d Her response was to email Blomfield her own resignation letter instead, effectively handing the whole project over to him. \u201cSomehow I convinced myself that the most important thing was Starling,\u201d she says, \u201cand that Starling should be more important than me. That\u2019s a very silly thing to do. It\u2019s a very feminine thing to do.\u201d Blomfield\u2019s \u201cterms of acceptance\u201d included the proviso that Boden take the \u00a31m debt with her. When she refused, he and the other four directors left to form Monzo.", "What happened next is pure Hollywood (with a smattering of James Bond). While alone in her office, shocked and wounded, a new team formed around Boden, starting with an old friend and associate who turned up uninvited, handed her a coffee, quietly found a desk and got to work. He called someone else, who called someone else. This new team was different. \u201cThey were mainly older, more experienced,\u201d she says. \u201cQuiet people. Serious people.\u201d (They\u2019re still with her now.) For eight months, everyone worked for nothing, then at the end of 2015, she was summoned to the Bahamas to meet billionaire Harald McPike, who was interested in investing in the challenger banking market.", "For three days \u2013 some of it on his yacht \u2013 he fired questions at her (\u201cThe most intelligent questions I\u2019d ever been asked about Starling.\u201d). By the time Boden flew home, she had \u00a348m in backing. In July 2016, Starling got its banking licence. (Monzo\u2019s arrived the following month.)", "I wish I could help more women understand you don\u2019t have to conform to stereotypes to be happy", "Starling now has 1.8m customer accounts and a staff of more than 1,000, with women filling 40% of the senior roles. Boden happily admits it takes up her whole life. \u201cPeople talk about \u2018work-life balance\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI only have work \u2013 and I enjoy every minute of it.\u201d She doesn\u2019t cook (\u201cI have no interest whatsoever\u201d) and hasn\u2019t married (\u201cone of these days, I\u2019ll write a book about men and dating!\u201d). She has no children. \u201cI never decided not to have children; as with many people, it just didn\u2019t happen,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to focus on what you have rather than what you don\u2019t. I\u2019ve had a great career. I\u2019ve done lots of stuff. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve built. I wish I could help more women understand that you don\u2019t have to conform to the stereotype to be happy, to be successful. But I\u2019ve been extremely lucky. I had a childhood that was loving and supportive, but with no pressure to be anyone different.\u201d", "Boden often refers back to her parents to explain her rock-solid self-belief \u2013 and one childhood memory seems to be especially telling. Whenever the adverts came on TV in her family home, her parents would both jump to their feet, grab each other and gyrate round the room \u2013 Boden would often join in. When the ads finished, everyone plopped back down again laughing. For years, Boden assumed this happened in all households and was disappointed to see when visiting friends that everyone else stayed slumped and still during commercial breaks.", "I ask if she still dances to the ads. \u201cYes!\u201d she laughs, \u201cI must admit, if there\u2019s a disco in the office or music somewhere, I\u2019m always first on the dancefloor! Everyone else is looking around, saying, \u2018She\u2019s dancing?\u2019\u201d", "Banking On It: How I Disrupted an Industry, by Anne Boden, is published by Penguin Business at \u00a320.
