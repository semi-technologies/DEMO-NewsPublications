He was very vigilant. So the idea of stealing kisses did not occur to us. But the scene was so sacred, so pure. It was so special to me.\u201d", "SEAN CONNERY IS REMEMBERED BY 'INDIANA JONES' COSTAR HARRISON FORD: 'GOD, WE HAD FUN'", "However, locking lips with James Bond wasn\u2019t always so simple.", "\u201cI remember were filming our kissing scene,\u201d recalled Carrera. \u201cWe looked up and there was [his wife] Micheline staring right back at us. It took us right out of the scene. So, Sean had her taken off the set. We laughed about that a lot after filming was long over. Micheline had a great sense of humor about the whole thing.\u201d", "Carrera said she was initially offered to star 1983\u2019s \u201cOctopussy,\u201d which featured Roger Moore as 007. However, when she heard that Connery was poised to appear in an upcoming film about the suave secret agent, she turned down the part, even if it meant taking on a smaller role.", "Connery initially promised to never play Bond again as he was eager to take on different roles. However, he was lured back by an offbeat script about a middle-aged 007. Connery took the role and helped produced the film.

So I agreed to it without thinking twice, without ever seeing a script. I just wanted to work with my hero. He was my Bond. He was the one I grew up with. So it was too incredible of an opportunity for me to turn down.\u201d", "\u201cSean Connery is Bond,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe had a magnetism about him that just drew you in. He was a man\u2019s man. He was the kind of person that men wanted to emulate. And women wanted to be dominated by him. He was the quintessential James Bond. I think all the other Bonds have tried to capture that certain magic he had, but it\u2019s just something that can\u2019t be duplicated. It belongs to him and only him alone.\u201d", "In \u201cNever Say Never Again,\u201d the former Playboy cover girl starred as professional assassin Fatima Blush.

But as I got to know him, I saw things about him that were not totally Bondish. He was a very sensitive man. He appreciated music when we weren\u2019t filming. And even though I was very nervous, he was always patient and kind to me. I never forgot how he made me feel. It was magical.\u201d", "SEAN CONNERY, SCOTTISH ACTOR WHO PLAYED JAMES BOND IN 7 MOVIES, DEAD AT 90", "According to Carrera, there was one thing that she wasn\u2019t expecting from her idol while filming \u201cNever Say Never Again.\u201d", "\u201cHe was afraid of the deep ocean,\u201d she shared. \u201cHe and I had a scene where we had to scuba dive in the ocean. I had never done that before and neither had Sean, I found out. We were supposed to do this when we were in the South of France that first month of shooting, but we kept making excuses on why we couldn\u2019t get together with the instructor. We eventually found ourselves in Bermuda where we were supposed to do that water scene. Neither of us had gotten the nerve to go in the water as it was shown to us by the instructor.\u201d", "\u201cI remember we were in our scuba gear and every time I would look at Sean, his lips were so blue,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI kept saying to myself, \u2018Oh my God, he\u2019s going to have a heart attack.\u2019 I tried joking with him, but he wasn\u2019t having it. I realized he was petrified. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but we went underwater and did the scene. But it was amazing to see this man show such vulnerability where you knew he was afraid.\u201d", "Carrera said that she and Connery stayed in touch over the years.", "SEAN CONNERY'S WIDOW REVEALS HE BATTLED DEMENTIA BEFORE HIS DEATH", "\u201cWhenever he was in town, we would get together,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last time I saw him and his wife was in Los Angeles at the Four Seasons hotel. He was running away from some women chasing him. It\u2019s been 10 years since I last spoke to him. You know how it is with these things. You don\u2019t see a friend for a decade and then when you get together it\u2019s as if time stood still. That was our kind of friendship over the years.\u201d", "Connery passed away on Oct. 31 at age 90.

You never knew if he was going to kiss you or kill you. It was the greatest thrill of my life. I feel honored to have had the opportunity to work with such a great actor and a great person like Sean.
