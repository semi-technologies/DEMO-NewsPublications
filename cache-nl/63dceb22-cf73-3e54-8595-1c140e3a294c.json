The first, on Nieuwmarkt, is a blueprint for similar spaces elsewhere in Amsterdam and the rest of the country.", "There are twenty-five tables, no more than 100 customers and staff are allowed at any one time, and booking via an app is a compulsory. That\u2019s what the outdoor eating plan for Nieuwmarkt looks like, though it will be implemented on 17 June, rather than 1 June when caf\u00e9s and restaurants reopen.", "Barry van den Berg, the man behind the plan, says it\u2019s a first step as the lockdown relaxes: \u201cIf you go full steam ahead right from the start, you\u2019re definitely going to have problems.\u201d Controlled outdoor eating and drinking is safer for customers, staff, and local residents, he points out.", "The square outside the Waag, the former weighhouse, will be a self-contained eating area with separate entrances and exits. You won\u2019t be able to just pull up a chair and order: you book via the events app Yourticketprovider, with one-hour slots available from 10 am to 10 pm and a maximum of two slots per table.", "When you leave, the tables and chairs will be cleaned, and then the next shift of customers filters in, having queued 1.5 metres apart. \u201cWe won\u2019t get anyone just wandering around looking for a place to eat,\u201d says Van den Berg.", "Drinking money", "When you book, you pay for your drinks in advance, so again you can\u2019t just show up. You order drinks and snacks using the Amsterdam Airchip app, and these are brought to your table, or you collect them from a central bar with socially distanced staff.", "Van den Berg is the operator of Caf\u00e9 del Mondo and, like many of his colleagues in the city centre, has limited space. He has been working on the restart plan ever since caf\u00e9s and restaurants shut down, for his own and dozens of other businesses on Zeedijk and in the rest of the Wallen that don\u2019t have outdoor space.", "They came up with the idea of a shared terrace, operated by a co-op of twenty to twenty-five local businesses. Each has contributed \u20ac5,000 in startup capital, and income and expenditure will be divided equally. The group also includes a representative of local residents.", "\u201cAs a 55-year-old Amsterdammer, I know we can\u2019t please everyone,\u201d Van den Berg says. \u201cBut we want to do this together, for the neighbourhood. All these places on Zeedijk are like a string of pearls, great venues frequented by locals, and we want to help them survive. Places like Het Mandje, Casablanca, and De Roode Laars. We\u2019re in danger of losing some of the pearls from the string.\u201d", "Coronaproof", "Similar outdoor eating plans are being drawn up across the land, some small, some large, to ensure people can visit caf\u00e9s and restaurants in a safe, controlled manner. The organisers say this is fundamentally important.", "\u201cAs the lockdown is eased, people go out looking for things to do,\u201d says Marc Josephus Jitta, of Heineken. \u201cPlus the summer holidays are coming up, so city centres will get busy whether you like it or not. If you don\u2019t manage this process, people will just sit down anywhere and there\u2019ll be a less controlled environment. Spread things out, and you won\u2019t get crowds. Apart from Nieuwmarkt, we\u2019re also involved in plans for the Leidseplein area and the Ziggo Dome indoor arena, which has an outdoor eating permit, and we\u2019re in talks with the RAI convention centre.\u201d", "Heineken has assembled a large number of partners to help, Jitta says. \u201cWe\u2019ve drawn up playbooks for how to equip restaurants and bars, and we\u2019ll be using some of the same technology as we do for events, but this won\u2019t be a festival. We want to make the best of our own and the events sector\u2019s expertise, and we\u2019re in touch with major organisers such as Mojo, ID&T, and LOC7000.\u201d", "Reward for good behaviour", "Van den Berg says it\u2019s important to adopt a gradualist approach. If Nieuwmarkt gets off to a good start and the authorities and local people are happy, the square\u2019s maximum capacity can be increased to 106 tables and 420 customers. \u201cA step like this should be a reward for good behaviour. We won\u2019t expand if anyone \u2013 police, businesses, residents \u2013 says we can\u2019t.\u201d", "There will be plenty of room for passers by and for stalls at the Saturday market, and even a corridor for elderly residents of the Flesseman care home, which overlooks the square. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried every possible design, and chosen the best walking routes to avoid getting too close to other people, the best layout so everyone has plenty of space, and things like where to put the toilets and bar.\u201d", "While Van den Berg has named the opening date, he has no idea when all this will end. \u201cSome people are saying it could last two years. The pandemic is far from over, but our plan is a temporary solution to a temporary problem. We\u2019re not out to permanently colonise Nieuwmarkt.\u201d"], "authors": ["Herman Stil"], "keywords": ["van", "pay", "amsterdam", "restaurants", "local", "nieuwmarkt", "outdoor", "plan", "outdoors", "book", "berg", "twohour", "wont", "maximum", "theres", "den", "eat", "eating"], "pubDate": "2020-05-30T12:00:00+02:00", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
