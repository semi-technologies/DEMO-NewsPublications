With the recent events of game creator/director Michel Ancel leaving the games industry altogether, for reasons that seem more complicated than what was first revealed, the future of the sequel doesn't seem as bright as many fans had hoped.", "During a recent earnings call (which also revealed the delay of Far Cry 6 and Rainbow Six Quarantine), Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot assured investors that the game is not stuck in development hell and that it is \"progressing well.\"", "Despite losing such a key name as part of the development process with Ancel's departure, Guillemot promised that \"The game is progressing well. The world is really fantastic. As you can see, Netflix also decided to take that universe and create a movie with it. So there's a lot of progress in that team and the game is coming along very well.\"", "The Beyond Good and Evil sequel is a drastic change from the story we fell in love with in the first game, but the open-world premise and creative leaps do show promise for what's ahead. That being said, the rumors surrounding Ancel's exit do not inspire hope that the game is progressing as well as the Ubisoft CEO says, citing an abusive work culture under Ancel's leadership that led to depression, burnout, and exhaustion throughout his team.", "The claims against Ancel were vehemently denied through a series of Instagram posts and since then, the reports surrounding his departure have died down. Whether there is truth to those claims remains to be seen but it was one more piece to the Beyond Good and Evil puzzle that had fans worried that this game will never see the light of day.", "What do you think about what the Ubisoft CEO had to say to investors about the progress of Beyond Good and Evil 2? Do you think that all is well, or will the sequel be the latest game to take one fall too many to see completion?
