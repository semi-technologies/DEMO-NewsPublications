Soon, he said, the company would have a car that runs on batteries with pure silicon anodes to boost their performance and reduced cobalt in the cathodes to lower their price. Its battery pack will be integrated into the chassis so that it provides mechanical support in addition to energy, a design that Musk claimed will reduce the car\u2019s weight by 10 percent and improve its mileage by even more. He hailed Tesla\u2019s structural battery as a \u201crevolution\u201d in engineering\u2014but for some battery researchers, Musk\u2019s future looked a lot like the past.", "\u201cHe\u2019s essentially doing something that we did 10 years ago,\u201d says Emile Greenhalgh, a materials scientist at Imperial College London and the Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies. He\u2019s one of the world\u2019s leading experts on structural batteries, an approach to energy storage that erases the boundary between the battery and the object it powers. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is going beyond what Elon Musk has been talking about,\u201d Greenhalgh says. \u201cThere are no embedded batteries. The material itself is the energy storage device.\u201d", "Today, batteries account for a substantial portion of the size and weight of most electronics. A smartphone is mostly a lithium-ion cell with some processors stuffed around it. Drones are limited in size by the batteries they can carry. And about a third of the weight of an electric vehicle is its battery pack. One way to address this issue is by building conventional batteries into the structure of the car itself, as Tesla plans to do. Rather than using the floor of the car to support the battery pack, the battery pack becomes the floor.", "But for Greenhalgh and his collaborators, the more promising approach is to scrap the battery pack and use the vehicle\u2019s body for energy storage instead. Unlike a conventional battery pack embedded in the chassis, these structural batteries are invisible. The electrical storage happens in the thin layers of composite materials that make up the car\u2019s frame. In a sense, they\u2019re weightless because the car is the battery. \u201cIt\u2019s making the material do two things simultaneously,\u201d says Greenhalgh. This new way of thinking about EV design can provide huge performance gains and improve safety because there won\u2019t be thousands of energy-dense, flammable cells packed into the car.", "A lithium-ion battery inside a phone or EV battery pack has four main components: the cathode, anode, electrolyte, and the separator. When a battery is discharged, lithium-ions flow through the electrolyte from the negative anode to the positive cathode, which are partitioned by a permeable separator to prevent a short circuit. In a conventional battery, these elements are either stacked like a wedding cake or wound around each other like a jelly roll to pack as much energy as possible into a small volume. But in a structural battery, they have to be reconfigured so the cell can be molded into irregular shapes and withstand physical stress. A structural battery doesn\u2019t look like a cube or a cylinder; it looks like an airplane wing, car body, or phone case.", "The first structural batteries developed by the US military in the mid-2000s used carbon fiber for the cell\u2019s electrodes. Carbon fiber is a lightweight, ultrastrong material that is frequently used to form the bodies of aircraft and high-performance cars. It\u2019s also great at storing lithium ions, which makes it a good substitute for other carbon-based materials like graphite that are used as anodes in typical Li-ion batteries. But in a structural battery, carbon fiber infused with reactive materials like iron phosphate is also used for the cathode because it needs to provide support. A thin sheet of woven glass separates the two electrodes, and these layers are suspended in an electrolyte like fruit in an electrochemical jello. The entire ensemble is only a few millionths of a meter thick and can be cut into any desired shape."], "authors": ["Daniel Oberhaus", "Daniel Oberhau"], "keywords": ["storage", "energy", "batteries", "materials", "battery", "used", "car", "greenhalgh", "invisible", "weightless", "pack", "structural", "future"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
