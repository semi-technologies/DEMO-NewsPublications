Yes, you good girl!\u201d she said, her eyes soft, as the mare chomped loudly on the treat, then butted a velvety muzzle into her owner\u2019s palm. \u201cHorses love peppermints. Right, Tenny girl?\u201d", "Zosia Mamet Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "Mamet, who is thirty-two, wore riding breeches and tall boots. She was spending her afternoon at the Stables at MiraBella, in Florida, New York, about two hours north of the city, where she has been riding for two years. Last spring, Mamet and her husband, the actor Evan Jonigkeit, gave up their Manhattan rental and moved upstate. Although the move wasn\u2019t animated by the pandemic, it dovetailed with it. \u201cWe ended up having this totally unprecedented pause, which meant I\u2019ve been able to ride Ten five or six days a week,\u201d Mamet said. She led the horse out of her stall toward the grooming area, where she secured her to the barn\u2019s ceiling with a pair of cross ties. \u201cWe just celebrated the one-year anniversary since I got her,\u201d she said, brushing the animal, whose eyes followed her owner\u2019s movements. \u201cUsually, on Mondays, the barn is closed. Look at her! She\u2019s, like\u201d\u2014Mamet\u2019s voice took on the cadence of a petulant tween\u2014\u201c \u2018Mom, it\u2019s my day off! What are you doing?\u2019 \u201d", "Best known for her six-season run as Shoshanna Shapiro, the plucky ditz savant on Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cGirls,\u201d Mamet is now starring in \u201cThe Flight Attendant,\u201d a fizzy murder mystery on HBO Max in which she plays Annie, the levelheaded lawyer best friend to Kaley Cuoco\u2019s good-time girl and murder suspect. Holding up a sleek black rider\u2019s helmet, she said, \u201cThis gorgeous thing was actually a wrap gift from Kaley. She\u2019s a horse girl, too!\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve always been a horse girl,\u201d she went on. \u201cI was born in Vermont, and my parents\u201d\u2014the playwright David Mamet and the actress Lindsay Crouse\u2014\u201chad gotten my older sister a pony. She was, like, \u2018Cute, whatever.\u2019 But I was, like\u2014\u201d She mimicked ecstatically throwing her arms around Ten\u2019s neck. \u201cFrom then on, I was hooked, a full-on horse nerd. I read all the \u2018Saddle Club\u2019 books, this dorky Y.A. series,\u201d she said. \u201cThat kind of love is like something in your blood; you either have it or you don\u2019t. Sometimes I describe it like an illness.\u201d She leaned down and began to clean out the dirt compacted in a horseshoe. \u201cTen has four shoes,\u201d she said. \u201cSome have just two. My first horse was Lucy, and I got her when I was thirteen, in Los Angeles, and she lived until I was, maybe twenty-seven?\u201d She worked a pebble from one shoe\u2019s grip. \u201cMy grandmother on my mom\u2019s side was a big rider,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was riding her horse, Uncle Sam, after a bad storm, and there was a downed power line and she didn\u2019t see it, and Uncle Sam stepped on it. He died underneath her! Very sad.\u201d She turned to Ten again. \u201cHey, boo-boo!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve recently started showing her, and a few days ago we were clipping her to make everything look nice, and we went a little too short with the forelock. So she\u2019s working with a smaller bang than usual.\u201d", "Outdoors, it was nippy but clear, and Mamet mounted Ten and began circling the ring, accelerating to a trot. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is what\u2019s called flatwork,\u201d she called out. \u201cAll the stuff we do in training when we\u2019re not jumping. I\u2019m teaching her to get into a frame. You see how she curls her head down? That\u2019s what we want. It makes them elongate their stride.\u201d She clucked rhythmically as she led the horse around the ring. \u201cOoh, this is a canter now,\u201d she said. \u201cThere you go, mama!\u201d After a few more spirited circles, she paused. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do in the world than be an actor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been kicked in the teeth so many times. It\u2019s such a hard profession; there\u2019s so much rejection, and so much instability and pressure. Riding is my solace.\u201d She patted Ten\u2019s neck. \u201cMy trainer has this saying: \u2018Ride the horse you have today.\u2019 Ten may have done something perfectly yesterday, and then I try to do it again and it\u2019s colder, it\u2019s earlier, I\u2019m tired and my leg isn\u2019t as on her, and, for whatever reason, exactly what I did yesterday isn\u2019t getting the same response. And acting is the same. You have to accept the circumstances you have and the moment you\u2019re in, and remember you\u2019re doing this thing because you love it.\u201d Ten snorted, as if in rejoinder. \u201cGood girl, Tenny,\u201d Mamet said. \u2666"], "authors": ["Naomi Fry", "Naomi Fr"], "keywords": ["doing", "horse", "shes", "love", "ive", "girl", "youre", "nom", "zosia", "mamet", "riding"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
