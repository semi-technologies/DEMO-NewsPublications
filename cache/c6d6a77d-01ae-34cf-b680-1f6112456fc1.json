The current Democratic senators represent 14 million more voters than the Republican senators, but it\u2019s the Democrats who are in the minority because of the outsize influence of low-population states.", "Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, has bluntly said, \u201cwe\u2019re not a democracy\u201d but a republic (actually, we\u2019re both). Lee, along with Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, even recommended repealing the 17th Amendment, which provides for direct election of senators. If senators were again chosen by state legislatures, Republicans would gain a few seats.", "More broadly, much of the Republican Party seems to fear voters and believes that its best path to victory is to suppress voting or even, in the case of Harris County, Texas, discard ballots. We no longer have poll taxes and grandfather clauses to disenfranchise Black voters, but G.O.P. officials modernized the barriers to voting by people of color. One careful study published in Scientific American last year found that voters in predominantly Black neighborhoods are 74 percent more likely to have to wait more than 30 minutes to vote than residents of white neighborhoods.", "Trump himself said in March that he opposed efforts to encourage more voting because \u201cif you agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d", "Yet here\u2019s another thought: Perhaps Republicans and Democrats alike have been too quick to assume that higher turnouts are inevitably bad for G.O.P. prospects."], "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof"], "keywords": ["voting", "times", "popular", "undermines", "york", "system", "republicans", "republican", "senators", "confidence", "voters", "trump", "electoral", "election", "donald", "vote"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
