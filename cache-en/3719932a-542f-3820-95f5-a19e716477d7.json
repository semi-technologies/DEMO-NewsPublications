One night in July 1994, a friend asked if she would like to join him for dinner. \u201cHe had another friend staying with him and asked if he could come with us,\u201d she says.", "When Tess arrived, her friend was in the bathroom, so Edward Johnson answered the door. Originally from the UK, he was working in Hong Kong on another trade publication, and visiting Manila for a football tournament. He says: \u201cI saw this vision of short, cropped hair and red lipstick. I\u2019d been struggling with a hangover, but it immediately went.\u201d They went out for dinner and became friends. \u201cHe seemed fun and different. He had eclectic taste and a great sense of humour,\u201d says Tess.", "Edward went back to Hong Kong, but they stayed in touch, using the fax machines at work to send messages to each other at the end of each month after their magazines had gone to press. \u201cI remember hearing the noise of the fax machine and getting excited to see if it was Tess,\u201d Edward says.", "When they met, both were in relationships, though it had never come up in conversation. Edward had split up with his girlfriend by the time he asked Tess if she would like to see him in Hong Kong on one of her press visits. \u201cI was living on Lamma Island, which was away from the noise of the city. There were no roads and cars and we used to walk around barefoot,\u201d he says. In April 1995, Tess agreed to stop for a visit before a work function. \u201cI walked down to the ferry pier to meet her. I\u2019d borrowed my friend\u2019s dog to make me look more dependable,\u201d he says.", "Although there was a \u201cspark of attraction\u201d, Edward was crushed when Tess told him she was dating someone. However, she soon realised things weren\u2019t right. \u201cWe went for dinner again before I left and I knew I was falling in love.\u201d Edward told her he was planning to leave Hong Kong to take a course in gemology, the study of gem stones, in California. \u201cMy plan was to go to Madagascar, but love changes your plans.\u201d", "Tess broke up with her boyfriend and Edward flew over to see her in Manila at the weekends, until he left for the US. \u201cWe had to overcome barriers, but we knew we wanted to be together. I moved in October 1995 and Tess visited me that Christmas.\u201d They spoke on the phone regularly and moved back to Hong Kong together the following year. Edward proposed that summer on a football pitch. \u201cWe were at a party and it was a quiet place to escape to,\u201d he says.", "Four weddings ... at their first ceremony, at a Hong Kong registry office.", "They originally agreed to get married in Macau in October 1997, to give friends and family plenty of notice, but \u201cin the February, we decided we just didn\u2019t want to wait and had a very small service,\u201d says Tess. As they prepared for the big Macau ceremony, they realised non-residents couldn\u2019t get married there unless they\u2019d had a Catholic service already. \u201cWe had to have a secret Catholic service before the big celebrations,\u201d says Tess. \u201cAfter the Macau wedding, my family wanted to have an English wedding at their local church,\u201d says Edward. \u201cMy dad joked that of all his children, I\u2019d been married the most times, but luckily always to the same woman.\u201d", "In February 2000, their son was born, and two years later the family moved to London. Tess studied Chinese medicine in 2010 and now works as an acupuncturist, while Edward is a consultant in the gem industry. \u201cEd used to think Asia was exotic, but I think the same about living in the UK \u2013 especially the breakfasts,\u201d says Tess. \u201cShe introduced me to Filipino breakfasts and now we mix it up. It\u2019s been wonderful getting to know another culture through Tess.\u201d", "He adores his wife\u2019s calm and relaxed attitude. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends. She keeps me grounded, looks after my health and brings me back to what\u2019s really important.\u201d Tess loves the fact that Edward makes her laugh. \u201cHe has this zest for life and it pulls us through all the difficulties.\u201d", "", ""], "authors": ["Lizzie Cernik"], "keywords": ["hear", "kong", "went", "service", "machine", "fax", "moved", "friends", "work", "tess", "hong", "married", "met", "excited", "edward", "id", "noise"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
