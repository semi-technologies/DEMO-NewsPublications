She wears the clothes; they don\u2019t wear her. With a penchant for bright colors and patterns, Vogue\u2019s latest cover star is a paragon of unstudied, downtown style. She could wear just about any high fashion label on the red carpet event, but often chooses indie brands and up-and-coming designers\u2014some of whom are her close friends\u2014giving them an extra boost in the process.", "Elsesser\u2019s own effervescence combined with the designers\u2019 cool factor makes for an unmistakable red carpet style. It\u2019s never overdone and always has a youthful air. Who else would wear full denim, designed by Brock Collection, to the Met Gala, as Elsesser did in 2019? Or Eckhaus Latta in daffodil yellow head to toe for the 2019 CFDA awards. Combined with a white Telfar purse, it was a bright look that supported multiple buzzy designers. As she put it in her Instagram post of the outfit, \u201cfriends wear friends.\u201d For a Whitney Museum party last year, she sported a loud, gold lam\u00e9 dress by Molly Goddard, complete with the designer\u2019s signature ruffles. How\u2019s that for a scene-stealer?", "If you\u2019re curious which young, indie brands you should know, you need only look through Elsesser\u2019s red carpet style.
