The draft rules, drawn up by the Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ), which enforces non-discrimination laws, are expected to be sent to schools this month. But after the Scottish government cancelled similar guidelines in June, activists in England have launched a campaign to halt the EHRC \u2019s new guidance, saying that it would put girls at risk.", "Under the new framework, schools would be advised and sometimes required to open up areas of school life that have until now been separated by sex to those who identify with that gender. So a male child who identifies as a girl could be allowed to use girls\u2019 changing rooms, or be admitted to an all-girls school. The guidelines mean that, on school trips, trans pupils could lawfully be placed in a bedroom with a child of the opposite sex.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Trans-rights groups say new, inclusive guidance is necessary. Stonewall, one such lobby, says it is \u201cvital all schools take active steps to create inclusive environments for trans pupils.\u201d Mermaids, a support group for transgender children, opposes any delay to the new guidelines: \u201cOrganisations have been working for years to build a constructive source of information on best practice for schools,\u201d it says.", "Yet some women\u2019s organisations argue that the new guidelines uphold trans people\u2019s rights at the expense of those of girls. The legislation that the EHRC is bound to uphold is the Equality Act of 2010. Seven of the act\u2019s \u201cprotected characteristics\u201d apply in schools: sex, religion, sexual orientation, race, disability, pregnancy and gender reassignment. Schools must weigh up how any policy affects people in those groups\u2014for instance, how building works affect the disabled, or how food in a cafeteria might suit Muslim or Jewish children.", "Nicola Williams of Fair Play for Women, a rights group, says that whereas transgender children\u2019s interests are consistently protected in the EHRC \u2019s guidelines, the rights of girls are not given equal weight. \u201cIt must be made explicit that sex and gender identity are different,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is especially important for girls to be able to recognise and name the male sex, otherwise the right to assert their boundaries is taken away.\u201d If a girl feels uncomfortable that a male child who identifies as a girl is using the girls\u2019 changing room, the new guidance says that the girl who feels awkward, not the trans child, should go and change elsewhere. \u201cWe need to be sympathetic to kids with gender dysphoria but without impinging on the rights of other children,\u201d says Tanya Carter of the Safe Schools Alliance, another rights group. \u201cThere are horrendous safeguarding issues around these guidelines.\u201d", "Another criticism concerns procedure. The EHRC said in 2017 that it would draw up new guidelines in partnership with two trans-rights groups. Yet organisations advocating for girls\u2019 rights say there has been almost no consultation with them. \u201cThey only seem to be listening to the trans lobby groups,\u201d says Ms Carter. The EHRC insists that it has consulted with women\u2019s groups.", "The guidelines are due to be released amid a steep, unexplained increase in the number of children identifying as transgender. The Gender Identity Development Service ( GIDS ), the NHS \u2019s only clinic for young transgender people, says the number of children referred there has risen more than 30-fold in the past decade, reaching 2,590 in 2018-19. Some were as young as three.", "Marcus Evans, a governor of the NHS trust under which GIDS operates, resigned in February over concerns that its \u201caffirmative\u201d model, which the EHRC also espouses, can lead too quickly to the prescription of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. He wants the process to slow down. \u201cA high number of kids with autism and mental-health issues, as well as kids who may just be gay, are now identifying as trans, as if they believe this identity will solve their difficulties,\u201d he says."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/10/03/transgender-rules-for-english-schools-face-a-backlash-from-women", "title": "Transgender rules for English schools face a backlash from women", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["transgender", "face", "women", "ehrc", "trans", "girl", "schools", "gender", "guidelines", "girls", "rights", "sex", "rules", "english", "backlash"]}
