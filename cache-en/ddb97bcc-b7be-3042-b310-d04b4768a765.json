Developed in the early 1940s, the film is a brand name from Kodak, and was a new type of color technology when their grandfather adopted it. (Instead of adding color to black-and-white images during processing, as is done with Kodachrome, this film allowed people to take images directly in color.)", "Four decades later, multimedia artist Harris began his own Ektachrome archive, in the 1980s and '90s as art and culture underwent seismic shifts, galvanized in part by a new wave of Black artists and critical thinkers, as well as LGBTQ artists grappling with the AIDS epidemic. Harris documented friends, lovers, idols and himself, as they moved through the linked creative and political circles that helped define this era.", "Lyle Ashton Harris in the mid-1990s.

It also includes tender moments of late filmmaker Marlon Riggs, who died in 1994 from AIDS complications, and who Harris met as a graduate student at the California Institute of the Arts. In one photograph from New York in the early '90s, author and activist bell hooks, real name Gloria Watkins, wraps her arm around Riggs as they share a laugh, their faces close. In another, Riggs sits in the backseat of a car with his mother and grandmother, on the night that he was honored for becoming the youngest tenured professor ever at the University of California, Berkeley, in the last months of his life.", "When it comes to the deaths of gay men or those with HIV, \"There is a narrative that still lingers today ... in the African American community,\" Harris said, \"that is shrouded in shame.\"", "The photograph is a testimony \"that there was a mother as well as a grandmother that ... was able to bear witness to their son who is in advanced stages of his life, in his mid 30s,\" Harris said, \"and to also simultaneously witness his celebration.\"", "A cultural shift", "In 2000 Harris left the United States and moved to Rome, then eventually Ghana in 2005 to teach for New York University. He didn't return stateside until 2012.

This shift, according to Harris, had a profound influence not only on Black culture, but also the wider contemporary culture and political theory.", "Collective community", "Harris emphasizes the collective community that formed around these pivotal moments -- and sees a connection to the anti-racist movements happening today. When graffiti artist Michael Stewart was killed by the New York City Transit Police in 1983 for tagging a station wall, he pointed out, artists from various backgrounds and disciplines responded, including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Lou Reed and Madonna.", "bell hooks and Marlon Riggs in New York in the early 1990s.
