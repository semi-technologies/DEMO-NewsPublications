But even its leader, Jacinda Ardern, seemed startled by its landslide victory in New Zealand\u2019s general election on October 17th. Ballots must still be counted from prisoners and expats, but so far Labour has mopped up 49% of the vote, compared with 27% for the main opposition, the conservative National Party. New Zealand\u2019s proportional voting system is designed to curb the power of big parties, by making it hard for them to govern without smaller coalition partners. Yet with an absolute majority in parliament (64 seats out of 120), Labour will be able to do just that.", "Although she does not need them, the prime minister is now in talks with the Green Party\u2019s ten MP s, to find what she calls \u201careas of potential co-operation\u201d. They might not enter teha full-blown coalition, but the pair could form a looser partnership whereby the Greens vote with the government on certain issues, in return for a ministerial portfolio or two, says Neale Jones, Ms Ardern\u2019s former chief of staff. The Greens\u2019 co-leader, James Shaw, was climate-change minister in the last government. One idea is that he could be re-appointed to that post. Such an arrangement would have the appeal of keeping criticism at bay. What is more, Labour has lots of ministerial jobs to fill, now that it has a parliamentary majority. Many of its MP s are rookies, so experienced Greens could help fill the ranks.", "Ms Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s most popular leader in generations (and one of the world\u2019s most popular\u2014see chart) has avoided debate about what happens next. Her upbeat campaign focused on how well her previous government, a coalition with a populist party, New Zealand First, kept the pandemic at bay. New Zealand has all but suppressed local transmission of the virus, allowing Kiwis to have fun in crowds\u2014a day after the election, 46,000 fans squished into a stadium to watch the All Blacks, the national rugby team, thrash Australia. But this does not mean that the country is immune to the economic symptoms of covid-19."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["task", "national", "s", "zealands", "greens", "day", "vote", "party", "mp", "coalition", "arderns", "labour", "hard", "zealand", "jacinda", "ahead"], "pubDate": "2020-10-24T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
