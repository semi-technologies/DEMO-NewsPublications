It was a very good year for the G.O.P. in the eastern part of the state. President Donald Trump thumped Joe Biden, the Republican senator Joni Ernst won re\u00eblection, and Ashley Hinson, a state representative, stunned the first-term representative Abby Finkenauer, who had been seen as a rising Democratic star in Congress. In an ordinary year, the election would now be in the rearview mirror, but not this year, and not for Molo, who doesn\u2019t think that Biden won the Presidency fair and square.", "\u201cWhat I don\u2019t believe is that Joe Biden won legitimately, without some sort of cheating or corruption. There\u2019s the evidence that seems to continue to mount. It doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Molo said, seated on a high stool in a bar in the town of Peosta. Molo, who is thirty and was wearing a white ball cap stitched with \u201cKeep America Great\u201d in golden thread, explained that he had listened to the November 19th press conference in which Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, Trump\u2019s attorneys, spread fantastical tales about a rigged election. \u201cWhat we are really dealing with here, and uncovering more by the day, is the massive influence of Communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China,\u201d Powell said. She endorsed a false Internet rumor that someone, maybe American soldiers, had seized computer servers in Germany as part of an investigation into Election Day vote manipulation in the United States. Powell\u2019s falsehoods proved too much even for Trump, and she was summarily cut from the team, but Molo found their allegations troubling and hoped that the judiciary would take them up. Even if Biden is declared the winner when the Electoral College meets this month, he said, \u201cit would be difficult to really believe it was totally on the up and up.\u201d", "The cues come from the top. On November 23rd, a few hours after Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administration, finally started the formal federal transition machinery\u2014without ever acknowledging that Biden was the apparent winner\u2014Trump tweeted that this was \u201cthe most corrupt election in American political history.\u201d For good measure, he added, \u201cWe will never concede.\u201d On Wednesday, he was at it again, posting on social media a mind-bending forty-six-minute video, in which he declared that it was \u201cstatistically impossible\u201d that he had lost. Standing in the Diplomatic Reception Room, behind a lectern that bore the Presidential seal, and appearing to read from a script, he called this \u201can election that we won, without question.\u201d He offered a blinding array of false charges, smears, and insinuations. \u201cThe Democrats had this election rigged right from the beginning,\u201d he said, disparaging not just Democrats but hundreds of thousands of election clerks around the country who labored to deliver an accurate count. Trump said that \u201cwe think\u201d some of the vote-counting was done in other countries, and that the counting software itself had been manipulated: \u201cWith the turn of a dial or a change of a chip, you can press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden. What kind of a system is this?\u201d", "The fact is Trump lost the popular vote to Biden by more than seven million votes, and lost the Electoral College by seventy-four. He lost five states that he won in 2016\u2014one in the West, one in the South, and three in the Upper Midwest. For the second time, he collected a smaller percentage of the national vote than Mitt Romney, whom he often mocks, won in 2012. \u201cThe Election was a HOAX,\u201d Trump proclaimed, in a tweet. Yet the evidence shows\u2014need it be said again?\u2014that there is not the remotest possibility that persons unknown orchestrated a conspiracy on the scale necessary to steal the election. Trump\u2019s own Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement calling this \u201cthe most secure election in American history.\u201d And it was a Trump appointee who wrote the scathing decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which rejected the President\u2019s limp attempt to overturn Pennsylvania\u2019s election results. \u201cCharges of unfairness are serious,\u201d the judge Stephanos Bibas wrote. \u201cBut calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.\u201d Even William Barr, Trump\u2019s loyal Attorney General, said this week that \u201cwe have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d", "If Trump\u2019s goal, more than a month after the election, is to defeat Biden and retain the Presidency, his effort is a historic failure. True to form, however, Trump has proved able to build a significant following for his claims. A Monmouth poll conducted in mid-November found that seventy-seven per cent of Trump\u2019s supporters believe that Biden\u2019s victory relied on fraud. Forty-six per cent of Trump voters surveyed by an Economist/YouGov poll said that they have little or no confidence that their votes were accurately counted. Could Trump be stoking outrage among his supporters to raise money for future political endeavors\u2014or simply to pay off his own debts? If so, that part of the strategy is working.", "The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have continued to send appeals for donations, with the strong suggestion that the money will be spent on efforts to challenge the election results. One, sent Thanksgiving weekend, declared a \u201ccritical end-of-month deadline,\u201d much like fund-raising pitches during the campaign. \u201cHitting our goal is crucial to continuing our fight to protect Election integrity, and I need YOUR help to keep going,\u201d the text printed over Trump\u2019s name read. But the fine print on the donations page said that most of the money would be deployed not to fight election irregularities but to fund Save America, Trump\u2019s new leadership political-action committee. The Trump campaign announced on Thursday that the fund-raising efforts have generated at least two hundred and seven million dollars since Election Day, much of it from small-dollar donors.", "As Trump raged, some of his allies in media and politics slowly backed away, but others have joined his fight. A fund-raising letter in Newt Gingrich\u2019s name claimed, on November 28th, that \u201cthe Radical Left\u201d is fighting hard \u201cto STEAL the White House.\u201d A week earlier, I was listening to Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show as I drove from Dubuque to Peosta. Hannity, the wealthy Fox News personality who has served as a Trump cheerleader and confidant, played a clip of Trump saying, on Election Night, \u201cThis is a fraud on the American public.\u201d The sixty-second piece\u2014which ended with an introduction for Hannity\u2019s show\u2014said the Democrats would \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to win the Presidency. \u201cThis battle has been raging for four long years,\u201d an announcer\u2019s voice said. \u201cSo, if you think this President is about to lay down, you\u2019d best think again. Your President worked tirelessly for you. Now it\u2019s our turn to help him.\u201d On November 23rd, the same evening that Emily Murphy began the formal transition, Hannity\u2019s fellow Fox commentator Tucker Carlson looked at the camera and told his viewers that Democrats, \u201cthe media,\u201d and \u201cBig Tech\u201d rigged the election in favor of Biden. He blamed \u201clegal harassment from the left\u201d for sidelining the National Rifle Association\u2019s efforts to get out the vote. \u201cThe 2020 Presidential election was not fair,\u201d he said, \u201cand no honest person would claim that it was.\u201d Revealingly, he focussed on the Presidential election and not on down-ballot races in some of the same states, with the same voters and the same ballots, in which Republicans dramatically exceeded expectations.", "Pauline Chilton, a Republican in Dubuque, certainly doesn\u2019t see the Presidential election as fair. A real-estate agent, born in South Korea and raised on Chicago\u2019s South Side, she lost her race for the Iowa House of Representatives. She\u2019s O.K. with that. It was a rematch, and she collected forty-three per cent of the vote, a four-point improvement over 2018. What bothers her is the sense that Trump was robbed of victory, \u201cprobably nationwide, the tactics that were used.\u201d She was persuaded by the Giuliani and Powell press conference, where Giuliani said he could prove that Trump won Pennsylvania by three hundred thousand votes, rather than losing it to Biden by the current margin of eighty thousand. (He has offered no such proof. Glenn Kessler, who runs the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker column, called the performance \u201cthe craziest news conference of the Trump presidency.\u201d) Chilton said, of Giuliani and Powell, \u201cThey seem to be very well prepared to fight this battle in court. It sounds like they have an immense amount of evidence. Witness statements and affidavits.\u201d Undergirding her suspicions is the belief that Biden was too weak a candidate to beat Trump, and certainly could not have won nearly twelve million more votes than Barack Obama, who collected sixty-nine million votes in 2008, when Biden was the Vice-Presidential nominee. Chilton said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that that many more people voted for him over Obama. I voted for Obama!\u201d"], "authors": ["Peter Slevin", "Peter Slevi", "Eliza Griswol", "Isaac Chotine"], "keywords": ["biden", "vote", "won", "audience", "think", "trumps", "molo", "votes", "lost", "trump", "election", "electionfraud", "finds", "bluster"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
