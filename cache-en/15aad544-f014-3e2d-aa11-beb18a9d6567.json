Maybe you even compost! If you\u2019ve been making a serious effort to live more sustainably, the holidays are here just in time to throw a wrench in your plans. The sheer variety of people on your gifting list\u2014in-laws, hard-to-please mothers, picky friends\u2014can make purposeful shopping a difficult task, and that\u2019s before you factor in an item\u2019s environmental or social impact.

Below, we\u2019ve narrowed down the very best sustainable gifts for everyone on your list, from upcycled and organic fashion finds\u2014like Paradis Perdus\u2019s recycled cashmere sweater and Collina Strada\u2019s patchwork dress made of rose petal \u201csilk\u201d\u2014to highly innovative ones, like Tom Ford\u2019s ocean plastic watch or House of Fluff\u2019s plant-based faux fur coat.
