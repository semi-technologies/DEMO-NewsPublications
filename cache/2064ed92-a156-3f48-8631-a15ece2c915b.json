The mulletted, jail-dwelling zoo proprietor and his activist enemy were the stars of Netflix hit Tiger King. Released early in lockdown, the series spawned feverish debate on everything from animal welfare to whether it might, hypothetically, be possible to feed your spouse to a tiger. At the centre of it all, Baskin became a pop culture hit and \u2013 perhaps surprisingly \u2013 a style superstar.", "Baskin\u2019s trademark animal prints have since been inescapable, with the press praising her \u201cEton mess of leopard spots and tiger stripes\u201d, often worn top to toe. Brands such as Saint Laurent, Dolce & Gabbana and Balenciaga majored in animal print for spring/summer 2020, meaning that Baskin was, by chance, right on trend \u2013 the everywoman who happened to be sporting the look of the moment, because that was always her look. The fast fashion retailer Missguided published a guide to channelling her style, while celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West would later use her as Halloween inspiration.", "The reason why Baskin\u2019s style has felt so important in 2020 is, I believe, that it is a true reflection of who she is. Baskin wears animal print because it speaks to her convictions as an animal lover, not because it looks good \u2013 though it pretty much always does. Animal print is, for her, \u201ca uniform\u201d \u2013 Steve Jobs\u2019s polo neck with a Peta twist. While occasionally reminiscent of the soap stars Kat Slater and Bet Lynch, Baskin\u2019s prints are displayed on clothing that is more floaty and comfortable than loud and cinched-in. Paired with long, beaded necklaces and flowery headdresses, her look could come across as an eccentric affectation, if it wasn\u2019t for her sense of purpose. She is the one true Nirvana fan in a sea of H&M T-shirts; she is the churchgoer who rolls an eye as they pass a sea of diamante \u201cfashion crosses\u201d in Claire\u2019s.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Baskin on the Disney Night episode of Dancing with the Stars in the US. Photograph: Kelsey McNeal/ABC/Getty Images", "But does her trademark style have links to the deep depths of her psyche? The fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen told the women\u2019s website Bustle that an affinity with leopard print \u201ccould indicate that [the wearer] is circumspective, meaning they\u2019re always on alert and on guard essentially \u2026 cats are peculiar creatures that have an amount of self-love that allows them to be alone. But when their owner comes home, they can be snuggled next to them. So they have this duality, if you will.\u201d", "Indeed, Baskin\u2019s own dichotomy is at the heart of the series. Are we to believe her side of the story \u2013 that Exotic threatened her and targeted her business \u2013 or was she in fact out to get him? The pink leopard-print top Baskin sports in the majority of publicity images for the show is frivolous, but with an inherent toughness. This is, after all, a show about a legal clash, which saw Exotic convicted of a plot to kill her. This is entertainment, but it\u2019s also an expression of our basest emotions. Tiger King is, in and of itself, animalistic. The symbol of the caged animal extends out to Exotic, now serving a 22-year prison sentence.", "For all this potential gravitas, Baskin\u2019s style has been a beacon during a difficult year, as seen in those Halloween looks. It may well have a deeper meaning \u2013 even a subconscious one \u2013 but at its heart, Baskin\u2019s love of animal print appeals because it\u2019s fun, something that has been severely lacking of late. Always canny, she is now hawking coronavirus face masks, furnished \u2013 of course \u2013 in leopard print. Having got us through the first lockdown with Tiger King, she might just get us through the second."], "authors": ["Hannah J Davies"], "keywords": ["exotic", "tiger", "animal", "baskin", "roars", "2020", "look", "icons", "carole", "stars", "meaning", "print", "baskins", "tv", "style"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
