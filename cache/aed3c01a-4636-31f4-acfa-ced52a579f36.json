Some time passed. And then the Quora algorithm served up a second wave of IQ musings.", "Well, well, well. This wave was something else. The essays were mesmerizing, the work of a group of IQ test-takers who had been\u2014it seems\u2014exiled from the high table. Strictly by the numbers, the exiles were the actual elites: a vanishingly small group of people who are so acutely self-assured that they are willing to write candidly about their low and average IQ test scores.", "What!? Compelling was too weak a word for this gold mine of self-awareness. Because of the childhood prohibition, I don't know my IQ and never will, but my SATs were average, and plenty of subjects bewilder me. I also don't identify with the lonely Mensa genius troubles, so, Occam's razor, I work on the assumption that like 98 percent of the population, I have an average IQ. With that tight math in mind, I figure the smart thing\u2014the averagely intelligent thing anyway\u2014is to read about the lives of people whose IQs are in the range of most people.", "The Quora question that intrigued me was this: \u201cWhat is it like to have a low IQ? What problems do people with low IQs face every day, apart from social stigma (if any) or pressure from family (if any)? What are some success stories and stories of family support and love?\u201d", "The most upvoted reply, a mini masterpiece, came from a user with a melodious writing style. He goes by Alex C. Lee on Quora, and he told me that he took the test twice and scored 96 and 98. (One hundred is dead average on many tests.) Though Lee likes to say street smarts serve a person better than IQ, he doesn't doubt that the IQ number means something\u2014and that, whatever it is, it has affected his life.", "\u201cOnce I went out for a drink with a classmate.
