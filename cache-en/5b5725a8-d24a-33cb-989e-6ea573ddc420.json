We are the biggest oil producer in the EU. We have, since the 1970s, to a large extent financed our welfare state with oil money. So to say, \u2018stop\u2019, and to pay the cost for that, is a big deal for us.\u201d", "To call it the \u201cbiggest decision\u201d is nonetheless significant for the man who for the past year has been the public face of what many argue is the world\u2019s most ambitious climate goal, Denmark\u2019s plan to cut emissions by 70% by 2030.", "In recent months, J\u00f8rgensen and Denmark\u2019s prime minister have come under criticism for over-reliance on technical solutions, such as two \u201cenergy islands\u201d, which together will generate 5GW of wind energy, and foot-dragging on issues like green tax reform.", "J\u00f8rgensen said he hoped Friday\u2019s announcement would show his government\u2019s green promises were sincere \u201cI think there\u2019s an English expression \u2018put your money where your mouth is\u2019, and that is basically that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said.", "He said the centre-right opposition Liberal party also deserved credit for backing the cancellation of the current exploration licensing round, something it had long opposed.", "\u201cThis is an example of what has changed in Danish politics, that we now really do have a broad support for the green transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitical parties that a decade ago would have never even have thought about this are now on board.\u201d", "The deal is binding on all future governments.", "\u201cThat\u2019s important, of course, because when we then tell the world that we will do this, they can count on it, but also for the industry, because it gives them some stability and certainty,\u201d J\u00f8rgensen pointed out.", "\u201cObviously, the industry is not happy about the cutoff date. They\u2019re not happy about us having cancelled the tenders. But on the other hand, I think they will be happy about knowing exactly what conditions they have. Because when we say 2050, then that also means we\u2019re not going to change that to 2045 or 2040.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Panorama of Esbjerg oil harbour, Denmark, oil rig on the shore of Nord see, summer 2019.

People would just shake their heads and think we were stupid.\u201d", "J\u00f8rgensen claims his government\u2019s existing actions have already brought Denmark a long way. \u201cWe need to reduce by 20 megatons between now and 2030, and we\u2019ve already reduced by five. We have 10 years to do it, and in one and a half years, we\u2019ve done a fourth of that,\u201d he said.", "J\u00f8rgensen has also been spending much of his time since his appointment last year on international outreach. Unfortunately, he said, some of the countries that looked likely to follow Denmark\u2019s example had had their plans knocked off course by the coronavirus crisis.", "\u201cThe pandemic has unfortunately put good developments to rest in some countries \u2026 I hope that this doesn\u2019t mean that too many countries forget that we have another extreme and more long-lasting crisis, which is the climate crisis.\u201d", "He said it was crucial the world did not repeat the mistakes made after the financial crisis in 2008 and divert stimulus spending to \u201cold-fashioned technologies\u201d.", "J\u00f8rgensen said he was not worried that US president-elect, Joe Biden, would be insufficiently radical.", "\u201cI have total confidence that the Biden administration will bring huge progress to the American transformation on the green agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely pleased when I see such progressive forces being given the power, and I think all the signs that we\u2019ve had from the president-elect and his team are pointing in the right direction.\u201d", "The four years of climate backsliding under Donald Trump, he said, should not be seen as fatal for efforts to keep global heating to an acceptable level.", "\u201cIn a lot of the individual cities and states, there has been some progress that can be built on, so I don\u2019t subscribe to the standpoint that there has been irreversible damage,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, when the US are re-entering, I\u2019d say that it can give us a new momentum.\u201d", "With Friday\u2019s announcement, Denmark has gained the moral power to punch above its weight. \u201cIn most countries, politicians will often say \u2018This is a historic decision\u2019. Sometimes it\u2019s true, other times it\u2019s not.
