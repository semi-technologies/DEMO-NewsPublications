Photograph by Mary Patten / Courtesy Smith College Archives", "In 1949, eight years after James Joyce died, his letters began to travel the world. Thanks to microfilm technology, popularized a few years earlier, the contents of his archive at the University of Buffalo became more accessible to curious readers and meddlesome critics than ever before. T. S. Eliot encountered them thousands of miles away, at the British Museum, in London, where he came face to face with a past self: his own letters to the Irish writer, lit up on a projection screen before him. Such exposure made Eliot uneasy. Later, in a letter sent across the ocean to Emily Hale, a teacher at a boarding school in Massachusetts, Eliot recalled the anxiety he\u2019d experienced that day in the museum: \u201cI thought, how fortunate that I did not know Joyce intimately enough to have made personal revelations or to have expressed adverse opinions, or repeated gossip or scandal, about living people!\u201d", "Eliot\u2019s letters to Hale, who for nearly seventeen years was his confidante, his beloved, and his muse, were another matter. They don\u2019t just repeat \u201cgossip and scandal,\u201d they produce it. Scholars have known about this correspondence since Hale donated Eliot\u2019s letters to Princeton, in 1956, but for decades, the trove of documents remained a tantalizing secret\u2014kept sealed, at Eliot\u2019s insistence, until fifty years after both he and Hale had died.", "2020 in Review New Yorker writers reflect on the year\u2019s highs and lows.", "On January 2nd of this year, 1,131 letters from Eliot to Hale were unearthed from the basement of Princeton\u2019s Firestone Library and made available to the public. The line to read them began forming at 8 A.M. The first surprise awaiting scholars was not a letter to Hale but, in essence, one addressed to them: a four-page statement that Eliot had written in 1960, with instructions that it be released on the same day that the Princeton letters were unveiled (or whenever, as he feared, they were leaked).", "In the statement, Eliot implies that Hale saved his correspondence in order to exact revenge on him for refusing to marry her. As for his own part in the drama, Eliot suggests that he was simply deluded, \u201cthat the letters I had been writing to her were the letters of an hallucinated man.\u201d (He also claims, with a legalistic precision worthy of Bill Clinton, that he \u201cnever at any time had any sexual relations with Emily Hale.\u201d) Eliot\u2019s dissociation from his earlier self\u2014from the man who wrote to Hale passionately, almost daily, for nearly two decades\u2014epitomizes the strange swerves between intimacy and detachment that characterize his side of their long and fraught relationship.", "The real subject of Eliot\u2019s statement isn\u2019t love but poetry. \u201cEmily Hale would have killed the poet in me,\u201d he insists. By attempting to renege on the undying love he had promised Hale, Eliot also hopes to revoke a more complex vow, one that these letters keep: the promise of a poet to his muse. There is no way to say whether marrying Hale would have destroyed Eliot\u2019s art. What reading his letters makes clear, however, is that the deferral of his desire\u2014the ascetic refusal to make his most enduring love ever truly complete\u2014was what sustained it.", "In 1913, Thomas Stearns Eliot and Emily Hale performed in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cEmma,\u201d in a parlor room right off Harvard\u2019s campus. Eliot was a Ph.D. student in philosophy: gawky and painfully shy. Hale, with her trained singer\u2019s voice and cultivated grace, had an arresting presence. After more than a year of operagoing and ice skating, Eliot proclaimed his love to Hale, stopping just short of proposing marriage. Hale was caught off guard; she could not reciprocate. Heartbroken, Eliot left to study in England.", "Just a year later, he had completely transformed his life: in June, 1915, he published his first major poem, \u201cThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\u201d in Poetry magazine, and married Vivienne Haigh-Wood, an English governess who was passionate about the arts and, unbeknownst to Eliot, prone to mental illness. For the decade and a half that followed, there is little record of Eliot and Hale\u2019s relationship. There appear to be many years of silence and at least one miserable encounter in London. What we do know is that they met again in 1930, and, shortly thereafter, the still-married poet poured his heart out to Hale in a transatlantic confession, sixteen years after his first, futile proclamation. \u201c[L]oving and adoring you,\u201d he wrote by hand, \u201chas given me the very best I have had in my life . . . in the midst of agony a deep peace + resignation springs.\u201d The best included his Christian faith; Eliot implies that his 1927 conversion to Anglo-Catholicism owed something to Hale\u2019s devotion as a Unitarian. And, of course, it included his poetry. At this point, he considered Hale both his saintly muse and his ideal reader. \u201cThere is no need to explain \u2018Ash Wednesday\u2019 to you,\u201d he told her. \u201cNo one else will ever understand it.\u201d (In his wife\u2019s copy of \u201cPoems 1909-1925,\u201d he had written, \u201cFor my dearest Vivienne, this book, which no one else will quite understand.\u201d)", "That Emily Hale\u2019s letters would become a part of his literary monument was a possibility Eliot considered only two months after his confession of love. He told her of a \u201clocked tin box\u201d he kept for his literary executor, with \u201ca closed envelope marked \u2018to be burnt at once\u2019 \u201d\u2014her letters, of course. Yet he couldn\u2019t quite bear the thought of their destruction, and entertained the opposite fantasy, too: \u201cBut what I wish to do is to mark it \u2018to be given to the Bodleian Library, not to be opened for 60 years.\u2019 \u201d He wanted her to be remembered always as the Beatrice to his Dante, the moral force behind his religious conversion, and the inspiration behind some of his most beautiful poems.", "T. S. Eliot and Emily Hale in Dorset, Vermont, during the summer of 1946. Photo courtesy Princeton University Library", "Most readers know Eliot as the arch-impersonal poet, who bewildered the world with \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d and proclaimed that \u201cpoetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion.\u201d Readers of this Eliot might, at first, have difficulty recognizing the gushy, hyperbolic admirer who signed his letters to Hale as \u201cTom.\u201d In many of the letters, he described Hale as a kind of divinity, or at least nobility: \u201cmy Dove,\u201d \u201cmy paragon\u201d; his \u201cone Fixed Point in this world.\u201d Yet Eliot\u2019s grandiloquent devotion can also sound like a kind of escape from certain messy feelings\u2014the turmoil of his marriage, his uncertainty about his career\u2014into something closer to what he sometimes called an \u201cart emotion,\u201d an impersonal, transcendent feeling. In his famous 1919 essay, \u201cTradition and the Individual Talent,\u201d Eliot wrote, \u201cThe progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality.\u201d In 1936, when Hale had at last returned his affection, Eliot marvelled to find himself engaged in a \u201cperpetual daily surrender\u201d to Hale, \u201cand yet at the same time . . . to something bigger than either \u2018me\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019 \u2013 to something that only you and I together can look at.\u201d Something, perhaps, like a poem.", "Writing to Hale was also therapeutic. \u201cI like to be able to write to you and curse the people I am fondest of,\u201d Eliot confessed:", "I think that we all have these feelings but that most people are prudent about what they put into letters, for fear of being misunderstood. I am not afraid of being misunderstood by you, but I would rather be misunderstood than not say exactly what I feel at the moment of writing.", "Eliot divulged a great deal in his letters\u2014about his family resentments, about his sexual experience (or lack thereof), and even about the men who had made physical and emotional advances on him. (His friendship with Lytton Strachey ended, he said, when the Bloomsbury writer \u201cwent down on his knees and kissed me.\u201d) As an Anglo-Catholic, Eliot already had a confessor, but his relationship with Hale was beyond confessional\u2014she did not have the power to absolve him but to absorb him.", "Eliot wrote to her obsessively, often twice a week. He learned when the ships carrying mail departed from England and kept track of which ones sailed fastest. Hale, for her part, was clearly burdened by Eliot\u2019s unceasing correspondence. Much later, in a statement she wrote to accompany the archive, she would describe herself in this period as \u201cthe confidante by letters of all which was pent up in this gifted, emotional, grasping personality.\u201d Hale, by then teaching at Scripps College, was overworked, and her health, although she tried to hide it from Eliot, was faltering. Her neuritis made it difficult for her to write. It wasn\u2019t only Eliot\u2019s insatiable demand for letters that taxed her. She was growing attached to him, and he was still married. From 1931 to 1934, Hale suggested at least five times that Eliot consider divorcing his wife. Eventually, Hale\u2019s deteriorating health compelled her to take leave from Scripps. Only then did Eliot acknowledge his own hand in her collapse: \u201cby constantly pressing myself upon your attention, and importuning you with my correspondence, I was really tampering insidiously with your mind.\u201d The melodrama of his self-censure\u2014\u201cI see myself as a blood-sucker\u201d\u2014is especially telling. Like a vampire, he had not only drawn what he needed out of Hale but also, in the process, transformed her. She was falling in love.", "Hale described herself as \u201cthe confidante by letters of all which was pent up in this gifted, emotional, grasping personality.\u201d Photograph by Shelley Szwast / Courtesy Princeton University Library", "Although Eliot had sought a formal separation from his wife in 1933, he made it clear to Hale that, as a converted Anglo-Catholic, he was both unwilling and unable to get a divorce. But for this constraint, he reminded her when pressed, \u201cI would literally give my eyesight to be able to marry you.\u201d He dwelled instead on the ways in which he felt them to be already bonded\u2014the feeling of \u201csimply belonging,\u201d which, he said, had \u201csomething eternal about it.\u201d His avowals became more pronounced in 1934, when Hale began an eighteen-month holiday in England and Europe. Whenever Hale came to London during her trip, Eliot let her borrow his flat\u2014a spartan apartment in a Kensington clergy house. The two of them spent the night before she left for America together, with Eliot literally at Hale\u2019s feet. \u201cI am filled with wretchedness and rejoicing,\u201d he wrote, almost as soon as she was gone, \u201cand when I go to bed I shall imagine you kissing me; and when you take off your stocking you must imagine me kissing your dear dear feet and striving to approach your beautiful saintly soul.\u201d (In January, 1936, Eliot wrote, \u201cI love your foot, and to kiss it has special symbolism, because you have to take off your stocking to let me kiss it, and that is a kind of special act of consent.\u201d) Marking this consummation, of sorts, they even exchanged rings. \u201cThis ring means to me all that a wedding ring can mean,\u201d he promised, \u201cand I love to wake up and feel it binding my finger, and know that it will always bind that finger.\u201d"], "authors": ["Michelle Taylor", "Michelle Taylo", "Louis Menan", "The New Yorke"], "keywords": ["muse", "emily", "love", "secret", "eliot", "correspondence", "eliots", "hales", "history", "wrote", "hale", "s", "statement", "letters"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
