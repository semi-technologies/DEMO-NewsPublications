I lead them into", "a living room, and whisper, \u2018Yes.\u2019", "This week\u2019s poem is from Dressing for the Afterlife, a lively second collection by the British Cypriot poet Maria Taylor. It establishes a tone of mixed comedy and pathos from the start. The first line, whose subject is declared by the two words of the title, reveals the portrait\u2019s practical, if faintly absurdist function: concealment. The wall in the narrator\u2019s house is damaged and, without the picture, its \u201cribs\u201d would be exposed \u2013 suggesting the vulnerability of the fatherless \u201chouse\u201d.", "\u201cHe\u2019s the only stranger I can afford,\u201d the speaker declares \u2013 \u201cafford\u201d suggesting that strangers are expensive company, emotionally as well as literally. They are hard work, if you have to invent their lives, and somehow make the strangeness both familiar and wonderful.", "After the narrator\u2019s confession, \u201cNothing to me, / but still I hang him in the hallway / and call him Dad\u201d, the focus shifts to the effect of the deception. The \u201cvisitors\u201d are won over, despite suspicions aroused by the fact that the father\u2019s light hair and blue eyes are not shared by the child. The inventiveness is impelled to wilder heights by the potentially endangering revelation. A moment\u2019s realism, the fishing trip, results in a mythological \u201ccatch\u201d \u2013 the fish that delivers deceptive riches. The father moves quickly; we can hear the snip of the knife in the embedded rhymes of \u201cslipped\u201d, \u201cslit\u201d, \u201cfit\u201d. The narrator remarks, in a colloquial, possibly ironic, even sinister aside, \u201cDad was handy\u201d. A deft seducer-magician, it seems he planted the ring himself in the trout\u2019s opened belly.", "You can imagine Taylor\u2019s narrator, like a skilled standup comedian, telling the stories deadpan, rapidly and without a smile. The credible and the incredible perform a quick-change routine as the stranger-dad undergoes various metamorphoses. The hulk who can change a tyre \u201cwithout a jack\u201d is also a harpsichordist and a painter. The final biographical revelation is that the smiling stranger hanging on the wall is a self-portrait.", "In the lines most charged with pathos, we\u2019re told, \u201cHe made us a sherbet playhouse, / we licked its walls to nothingness\u201d. This recalls the witch\u2019s gingerbread house in the Hansel and Gretel fairytale, only the sherbet playhouse was, perhaps, intended to be a benign invention, a sweet safe space that inevitably proved ephemeral. The image reminds us of the cracked plaster and exposed ribs at the beginning of the poem. \u201cNothingness\u201d also evokes the remark, \u201cNothing to me \u2026\u201d This is the depth of the void needing to be filled and masked.", "We can\u2019t be sure whether the visitors are sincere when, being informed that the father didn\u2019t survive to paint all the children, they sigh: \u201cWhat a terrible loss.\u201d The conventional expression of condolence is intensified by the speaker\u2019s honest agreement \u2013 the \u201cyes\u201d that affirms the loss really is \u201cterrible\u201d. The truth may be that no father ever existed. That use of the indefinite article in the statement, \u201cI lead them into a living room \u2026\u201d seems particularly poignant. The solidity afforded by the usual phrase specifying \u201cthe living room\u201d is missed: the room and the living seem insubstantial as a result.", "Although My Stranger alludes to the opening line of Robert Browning\u2019s My Last Duchess, sharing that chilly, disconcerting little joke that the person portrayed is literally hanging on the wall, Taylor\u2019s narrative conducts her own psychological exploration. Edgily casual, deftly timed, My Stranger is wise to both the power and danger of fantasy, however face-saving and, to a point, life-saving. The listeners in the hallway of the poem aren\u2019t deceived or shocked. They collude, or at least appear to. They submit to the narrator on the latter\u2019s own terms, and are willingly led deeper into the house."], "authors": ["Carol Rumens"], "keywords": ["dad", "room", "stranger", "ribs", "sherbet", "taylor", "living", "poem", "week", "maria", "house", "terrible", "wall"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
