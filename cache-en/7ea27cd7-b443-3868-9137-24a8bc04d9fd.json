In \u201cThe Hunt\u201d (2012), Mikkelsen played a kindergarten teacher who is wrongly accused of being a pedophile. In the new movie, he plays Martin, a high-school history teacher who is accused, correctly, of being an alcoholic. Note that both protagonists (it\u2019s hard to call them heroes) are in positions of civic responsibility, from which they slide: our two-bit modern answer to the kings and overlords whose precipitate falls were formerly the stuff of tragedy. In each case, the result is at once compelling and difficult to watch. Martin, for example, is discovered, in the early morning, sleeping outside a neighbor\u2019s house, with his keys in his hand and a livid cut on his brow. He is retrieved by his son Jonas (Magnus Sj\u00f8rup), and what\u2019s shocking is how unshocked the boy looks; this must have happened before. Later, at dinner, Martin tries to explain. \u201cWell, I got a little drunk yesterday,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, Dad,\u201d Jonas replies, \u201cyou\u2019ve been drunk for a while, haven\u2019t you?\u201d", "There are two unusual things about Martin\u2019s drinking. First, it\u2019s not a passive condition into which he has slumped; it\u2019s a plan. Second, it\u2019s a joint effort. Keeping him company are three of his colleagues: Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), a sports coach, who goes to soccer practice with a plastic bottle of liquor, as if it were Gatorade; Peter (Lars Ranthe), a music lover, who verses his pupils in patriotic songs, while grabbing a quick swig behind their backs; and Nikolaj (Magnus Millang), who teaches psychology, asking his class, \u201cWhy do we behave, experience, and react as we do?\u201d An excellent question, and one response, apparently floated by a Norwegian philosopher, is that humans are born with too little alcohol in their veins. So that\u2019s it. We have a duty to repair the deficit, and, to this end, Nikolaj, Peter, Tommy, and Martin resolve to keep themselves topped up, while collating evidence of \u201cverbal, motor, and psycho-rhetorical effects.\u201d No booze after 8 P.M., or on weekends, but otherwise let it flow.", "To begin with, the scheme goes swimmingly. At school, after making a pit stop in the bathroom to refuel with Smirnoff, Martin treats his admiring students to a master class on Churchill, Roosevelt, and the art of leadership. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this good in ages,\u201d he tells his fellow-lushes, and, like gamblers on a hot streak, they raise the stakes. Up goes their daily intake. You can see where the film is heading, and, sure enough, the comedy of excess\u2014profoundly unfunny to those who are bruised by it, like Martin\u2019s wife, Anika (Maria Bonnevie)\u2014kicks in. Nikolaj crawls home after a Rabelaisian binge, makes it to the bedroom, and tries, in vain, to use a baby monitor as a Breathalyzer; Peter, for his part, advises a fretful pupil to soothe his nerves with a drink before an oral exam. Mind you, this being Denmark, the subject of the test is Kierkegaard, so Peter may have a point.", "The four leading men are all too convincing, not least when they lark about in the park like small boys, yet that virtue creates a problem for the film. Is it really an ensemble piece, or do we want it to revolve around Martin? Is he not the story\u2019s lonely heart? The issue arises early on, at a lavish dinner for Nikolaj\u2019s fortieth birthday, where the quartet of friends progresses\u2014if that is the word\u2014from champagne, to vodka, to a fine 2011 Burgundy. Martin, who is driving, opts for a soda, but Peter cajoles him to hit the hard stuff, and Nikolaj argues that it makes a person \u201cmore relaxed and poised and musical and open.\u201d We follow Martin\u2019s expression as he listens\u2014distracted and half amused, with a spectre of a smile. When he gives in and samples the vodka, then drains a glass of the wine in a single quaff, you see tears, unshed, befogging his gaze, as if he were moved by a sudden memory. Or maybe the alcohol went straight to his eyes. Either way, as he slowly mists over, his features illuminated in the soft-shadowed room, you stare at him and enter into his trance.", "Now that Jack Palance is dead, does any living star have a face more distinctive than Mikkelsen\u2019s? It seems carved rather than molded, with hints of both the delicate and the incisive. He broke through as a villain, in \u201cCasino Royale\u201d (2006), scrutinizing 007 at the poker table, but you can imagine him as a penitent, or as the leader of a cult, and his handsomeness is of the secretive, non-open variety that invites suspicion. That\u2019s why \u201cThe Hunt\u201d grew so taut, and why, in \u201cAnother Round,\u201d as Martin dives ever deeper into the drink, and as it renders him unbeautiful, you can\u2019t help asking what sorrows, or what smoldering disappointments, this man is seeking to douse. As he remarks to his pupils, \u201cThe world is never as you expect.\u201d", "Audiences in 1945 were equally curious, I\u2019d guess, about Don Birnam, the sozzled character in Billy Wilder\u2019s \u201cThe Lost Weekend.\u201d That film certainly touched a chord, winning the Academy Award for Best Picture, and its triumph suggested that Don was not an exception. His plight was practically a rule, and I thought of him during \u201cAnother Round\u201d as Anika sighs over Martin\u2019s carousing and says, \u201cThis entire country drinks like maniacs anyway.\u201d The movie\u2019s original title was \u201cDruk\u201d\u2014a splendidly percussive Danish noun, our nearest equivalent being \u201cbender,\u201d so why dampen it into \u201cAnother Round,\u201d with its hearty and pub-heavy dullness? (Vinterberg has suffered this belittling before. In 1998, \u201cFesten,\u201d his fiercest film, became \u201cThe Celebration\u201d for American viewers.)", "All in all, however, this is one of the director\u2019s most absorbing works. It soaks you up, and its melancholy (a shot of Martin, say, eating cereal on his own, in the semi-dark) is somehow less disturbing than its sprees. Hence the book-ends: scenes of revelling students, who begin the movie by racing around a lake, knocking back beers as they go, and bring it to a conclusion, after graduating, by parading in trucks festooned with greenery. Whether such hoopla counts as a happy ending or as a reckless lie\u2014whether the kids should be granted their fun, or whether the next generation of inebriates is already in training for its own destruction\u2014is open to debate. As for Martin, he is greeted with delirium by the graduates, beside a harbor, and retorts by exploding into a dance. In his youth, Mikkelsen trained as a dancer, and it shows. Martin has just had a fortifying drink with his pals, and now, inspired, he springs and curvets, ominously close to the water\u2019s edge, jumping for something worse than joy.", "How much alcohol you should insert into your bloodstream before attempting to watch \u201cThe Prom,\u201d the new Ryan Murphy film, is not easy to gauge. It may well be most amenable to the completely blotto. I made the grave mistake of seeing it sober, and there were moments when I simply lost my courage and had to look away, as some people do during the tooth-drilling scene in \u201cMarathon Man.\u201d", "There are oodles of self-mockery here, yet never quite enough, and the plot is a rum affair. Two stage troupers from New York, Dee Dee Allen (Meryl Streep) and Barry Glickman (James Corden), are mortified when their new show, a musical about Eleanor Roosevelt, shuts after opening night. Informed that the fault lay not with the production but with the rampancy of their egos, they decide to burnish their moral reputations by finding a cause to support. A friend of theirs, Angie Dickinson (Nicole Kidman), learns, via Twitter, about a student named Emma Nolan (Jo Ellen Pellman), out in the hinterland, who wants to take her girlfriend to the prom. Rather than indulge her heathen wishes, the school\u2019s PTA has cancelled the whole event. Horrors! So it is that Dee Dee, Barry, Angie, and another resting performer, Trent Oliver (Andrew Rannells), travel to Indiana\u2014boo, hiss\u2014to save the day, or the magical night. \u201cWe are liberals from Broadway!\u201d they exclaim.", "According to Susan Sontag, in an influential essay from 1964, \u201cIt goes without saying that the Camp sensibility is disengaged, depoliticized\u2014or at least apolitical.\u201d Not anymore. \u201cThe Prom\u201d uses camp very determinedly as a weapon, designed to inflict maximum correction and complaint. Although the big routines retain the crisp and fevered stomp, weirdly bereft of grace, that was the house style of Murphy\u2019s \u201cGlee,\u201d the purpose of them, as enacted by Dee Dee and her posse of urban outsiders, is to demonstrate to any recalcitrant hicks the error of their non-inclusive ways. Nothing that I\u2019ve witnessed onscreen in 2020 is more bizarre than a sequence in a shopping mall, where Trent, by means of song and dance, not only berates the senior squares from Emma\u2019s school but specifically targets their Christian faith; by the end of the number, he has successfully converted them to his secular vision of love. It\u2019s possible both to agree entirely with the movie\u2019s politics and, at the same time, to feel that you\u2019re being strangled by a rainbow, and we should thank the Lord that \u201cThe Prom\u201d wasn\u2019t released before the election. I can think of some states, not just Indiana, where wavering voters, disgruntled rather than wowed by the film\u2019s remorseless plea for tolerance, might have swung in the opposite direction. \u2666"], "authors": ["Anthony Lane", "Anthony Lan"], "keywords": ["weaponized", "camp", "alcoholism", "dee", "round", "goes", "film", "martins", "nikolaj", "martin", "peter", "mikkelsen", "prom", "planned"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
