What have we learned since March?", "A. Distance is the most effective intervention; the virus doesn\u2019t have legs, so if you are physically distant from people, you avoid direct contact and droplets. Then you have to consider inside spaces, which are especially in play during winter or in hotter countries during summer: the bus, the gym, the office, the bar or the restaurant. That\u2019s because we know SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious in aerosols (small floaty droplets) and we know that aerosol spread explains Covid-19 superspreading events. Try not to be in those spaces with others, but if you have to be, minimize your time there (work from home if you can) and wear a mask. Don\u2019t go grocery shopping as often. Hold off on going out, parties, gatherings. You can do these things later.", "The Road to a Coronavirus Vaccine Words to Know About Vaccines Confused by the all technical terms used to describe how vaccines work and are investigated? Let us help: Adverse event: A health problem that crops up in volunteers in a clinical trial of a vaccine or a drug. An adverse event isn\u2019t always caused by the treatment tested in the trial. Antibody: A protein produced by the immune system that can attach to a pathogen such as the coronavirus and stop it from infecting cells. Approval, licensure and emergency use authorization: Drugs, vaccines and medical devices cannot be sold in the United States without gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, also known as licensure . After a company submits the results of clinical trials to the F.D.A. for consideration, the agency decides whether the product is safe and effective, a process that generally takes many months. If the country is facing an emergency \u2014 like a pandemic \u2014 a company may apply instead for an emergency use authorization , which can be granted considerably faster. Background rate: How often a health problem, known as an adverse event, arises in the general population. To determine if a vaccine or a drug is safe, researchers compare the rate of adverse events in a trial to the background rate. Efficacy: The benefit that a vaccine provides compared to a placebo, as measured in a clinical trial. To test a coronavirus vaccine, for instance, researchers compare how many people in the vaccinated and placebo groups get Covid-19. Effectiveness, by contrast, is the benefit that a vaccine or a drug provides out in the real world. A vaccine's effectiveness may turn out to be lower or higher than its efficacy . Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials: Clinical trials typically take place in three stages. Phase 1 trials usually involve a few dozen people and are designed to observe whether a vaccine or drug is safe. Phase 2 trials, involving hundreds of people, allow researchers to try out different doses and gather more measurements about the vaccine\u2019s effects on the immune system. Phase 3 trials, involving thousands or tens of thousands of volunteers, determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine or drug by waiting to see how many people are protected from the disease it\u2019s designed to fight. Placebo: A substance that has no therapeutic effect, often used in a clinical trial. To see if a vaccine can prevent Covid-19, for example, researchers may inject the vaccine into half of their volunteers, while the other half get a placebo of salt water. They can then compare how many people in each group get infected. Post-market surveillance: The monitoring that takes place after a vaccine or drug has been approved and is regularly prescribed by doctors. This surveillance typically confirms that the treatment is safe. On rare occasions, it detects side effects in certain groups of people that were missed during clinical trials. Preclinical research: Studies that take place before the start of a clinical trial, typically involving experiments where a treatment is tested on cells or in animals. Viral vector vaccines: A type of vaccine that uses a harmless virus to chauffeur immune-system-stimulating ingredients into the human body. Viral vectors are used in several experimental Covid-19 vaccines, including those developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson. Both of these companies are using a common cold virus called an adenovirus as their vector. The adenovirus carries coronavirus genes. Trial protocol: A series of procedures to be carried out during a clinical trial.", "", "We don\u2019t talk about eye coverings much, but we should, because we don\u2019t know enough about the role of eyes in transmission. We do know that eyes are a window to the upper respiratory tract.", "Q. Where does the \u201cmisinformation mouse\u201d fit in?", "A. The misinformation mouse can erode any of those layers. People who are uncertain about an intervention may be swayed by a loud and confident-sounding voice proclaiming that a particular layer is ineffective. Usually, that voice is not an expert on the subject at all. When you look to the experts \u2014 usually to your local public health authorities or the World Health Organization \u2014 you\u2019ll find reliable information.", "An effect doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to reduce your risk and the risk to those around you. We need to remember that we\u2019re all part of a society, and if we each do our part, we can keep each other safer, which pays off for us as well.", "Another example: We look both ways for oncoming traffic before crossing a road. This reduces our risk of being hit by a car but doesn\u2019t reduce it to zero. A speeding car could still come out of nowhere. But if we also cross with the lights, and keep looking as we walk, and don\u2019t stare at our phone, we drastically reduce our risk of being hit.", "We\u2019re already used to doing that. When we listen to the loud nonexperts who have no experience in protecting our health and safety, we are inviting them to have an impact in our lives. That\u2019s not a risk we should take. We just need to get used to these new risk-reduction steps for today\u2019s new risk \u2014 a respiratory virus pandemic, instead of a car.", "Q. What is our individual responsibility?", "A. We each need to do our part: stay apart from others, wear a mask when we can\u2019t, think about our surroundings, for example. But we can also expect our leadership to be working to create the circumstances for us to be safe \u2014 like regulations about the air exchange inside public spaces, creating quarantine and isolation premises, communicating specifically with us (not just at us), limiting border travel, pushing us to keep getting our health checks, and providing mental health or financial support for those who suffer or can\u2019t get paid while in a lockdown."], "authors": ["Siobhan Roberts"], "keywords": ["defense", "vaccines", "drug", "model", "health", "used", "safe", "trial", "risk", "clinical", "trials", "cheese", "pandemic", "vaccine", "swiss"], "pubDate": "2020-12-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
