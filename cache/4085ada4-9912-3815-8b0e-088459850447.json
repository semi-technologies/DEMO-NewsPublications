Called up by the Army Air Force, he was sent to a two-part officer training program, which began in Miami and was completed at Harvard Business School \u2014 where he learned \u201cstatistical control\u201d and \u201cquantitative management,\u201d a specialized form of accounting in an unusual program designed to build on his business background.", "Emmett eventually was deployed to Tuskegee, Ala., where he joined the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the nation\u2019s first black fighter pilot unit, which distinguished itself in combat in Europe. Though he learned to fly, my father was not a fighter pilot, but a staff officer who ran the newly created Statistics Office, which performed management analyses for commanding officers. He earlier served a stint at Godman Field adjacent to Fort Knox, Ky. There, he was denied access to the white officers\u2019 club. To add insult to injury, he saw German prisoners of war being served at restaurants restricted to blacks. Both in the military and the confines of off-base life, his time in Kentucky was a searing reintroduction to the Southern segregation he had experienced as a child in South Carolina.", "Still, socially and intellectually, dad\u2019s Tuskegee years were formative. He met an elite cadre of African-American men who would later be disproportionately represented in America\u2019s postwar black professional class, among them my mother\u2019s brothers, Leon and David Dickson. Dad\u2019s Tuskegee friends and acquaintances formed a network he maintained throughout his life. What was it, I have often wondered, about those Tuskegee Airmen and support personnel that seemingly enabled them to become a vanguard of black achievement? Perhaps the military preselected unusually well-educated and capable men for Tuskegee, or some aspect of their service experience propelled them as a group to succeed. To my lasting regret, I failed to take the opportunity to study this topic in depth before almost all those heroes passed away.", "Following D-Day, my father was sent to the West Coast to prepare for deployment to the Pacific theater. He was spared combat by President Harry Truman\u2019s decision to drop atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, provoking the Japanese surrender. My dad\u2019s service to our nation has long been a source of pride for me, particularly his affiliation with the celebrated Tuskegee \u201cRed Tails\u201d who defied every expectation of their skill and patriotism."], "id": "4085ada4-9912-3815-8b0e-088459850447", "pubDate": null, "title": "Opinion | What My Father Taught Me About Race"}
