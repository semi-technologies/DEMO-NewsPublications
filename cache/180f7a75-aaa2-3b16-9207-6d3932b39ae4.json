This is a designer who has run his own business, 3.1 Phillip Lim, for 15 years; it\u2019s fair to assume his wardrobe is well stocked. It isn\u2019t that he was lacking great clothes; it\u2019s just that they didn\u2019t feel relevant to his dramatically different life. What do you wear to comfortably work from home for weeks on end, other than sweats? What about for the two-hour walks we\u2019ve been taking to preserve our sanity? Or the myriad activities that have moved outdoors, like dining, drinking, socializing, even catching a movie?", "Lim felt compelled to design a collection for this moment, not the far-off future. Fashion\u2019s standard cycle of predicting what we\u2019ll be in the mood for six months from now felt newly archaic. \u201cWhat am I going to wear just to get through the day and be ready to move?\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to live in sweatpants or pajamas. I needed something adaptable.\u201d", "On his coffee table, he started sketching what is now \u201cLive Free,\u201d a new direct-to-consumer capsule of comfortable, durable, and highly considered essentials for men and women: boxy T-shirts, relaxed blazers, split-hem trousers, weightless parkas. Lim calls it \u201cat-leisure,\u201d a play on athleisure, the key difference being that you wouldn\u2019t actually exercise in these clothes. There\u2019s a pair of leggings, but they\u2019re for \u201crunning around,\u201d not marathon training; they\u2019re comfier than your vintage jeans, but sturdier and more like \u201creal pants\u201d than your spandex tights. \u201cThey\u2019re wardrobe building blocks that are made for living,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was created in the present to allow us to be in the present and feel a sense of freedom.\u201d"], "authors": ["Emily Farra", "Emily Farr"], "keywords": ["lim", "phillip", "antibacterial", "didnt", "redefines", "sportinspired", "wardrobe", "present", "fashion", "felt", "collection", "feel", "live", "theyre", "wear", "functional"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
