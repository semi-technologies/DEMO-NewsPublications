No K.K.K.! No fascist U.S.A.!\u201d Inside, election officials were counting hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots from voters in Philadelphia. Donald Trump was still ahead in the state\u2019s tally, but the remaining votes, which came mostly from Philadelphia and the surrounding areas, looked likely to be overwhelmingly for Joe Biden. The Trump campaign had just announced that it was filing an emergency injunction in an attempt to stop Pennsylvania from counting the remaining ballots. Protesters feared that the President would succeed in muddying the results and halting the counting process. \u201cDonald Trump is stealing the election!\u201d one called into a microphone plugged into a portable amplifier. Another yelled, \u201cA fascist President is declaring victory! We voted with our ballots and now it\u2019s time to come out into the street and vote with our feet!\u201d", "The mood was tense. Off to the side, a young counter-protester wearing a MAGA hat spoke to a European reporter. Rise, who was wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the word \u201cDECOLONIZE,\u201d pressed their way into the conversation and shouted, \u201cInterrupt bigotry!\u201d (Rise self-identifies as gender nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns.) The young man told Rise that they weren\u2019t being civil. \u201cPoliteness doesn\u2019t equate justice!\u201d Rise snapped back. A group of police officers with bicycles moved in and broke up the argument. \u201cWe knew for weeks that Trump would manipulate whatever happens,\u201d Rise told me. \u201cThe reality is, this is so close. There are searing wounds in this country. But four more years of Trump would put people in harm\u2019s way.\u201d", "Samantha Rise is a community organizer in Pennsylvania.", "Pennsylvania has long been a battleground state, and in the lead-up to this year\u2019s contest it appeared as if it might decide the election. On Election Night, however, Trump took a significant lead, and it looked as if the election might be decided elsewhere\u2014in Nevada, say, or Arizona. But, in the coming days, Pennsylvania underwent what has come to be known as a \u201cblue shift.\u201d Democrats had requested more mail-in ballots than Republicans had by a margin of two to one. The state\u2019s Republican legislature had prevented county commissioners from sorting or counting these ballots ahead of time, a process called pre-canvassing. This meant that in-person results, which tended to favor Republicans, were announced first. But, as mail-in votes were painstakingly counted, Biden gained steadily. (A similar story played out in Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where mail-in ballots added to Biden\u2019s tally in the days after the election.) Experts had predicted this phenomenon, but, as you watched Pennsylvania turn red, it was difficult to trust that it would turn back. \u201cOur last poll said that seventy-eight per cent of mail-in ballots were Biden ballots, and if you did the math it was on his side,\u201d Chris Borick, a political analyst at Muhlenberg College, told me. \u201cI could give people all the empirical evidence I had, but the experiences of 2016 were so traumatic, it was really hard for them to believe.\u201d But by Wednesday evening it appeared that Biden could win Pennsylvania, and that, if he did, he would win the Presidency.", "To prevent this from happening, the Trump campaign urged officials around the country to stop tallying mail-in ballots, claiming, baselessly, that they were fraudulent. In a speech on Thursday evening, Trump said that he was being cheated out of an election victory. \u201cIf you count the legal votes, I easily win,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.\u201d Right-wing protesters gathered outside county offices in Detroit and chanted, \u201cStop the count!\u201d (In Phoenix, where Trump was gaining ground, they chanted, \u201cCount the vote!\u201d) On Wednesday, Eric Trump and Rudy Giuliani held a rally near the Philadelphia airport, where they announced the Trump campaign\u2019s lawsuit against the state, apparently for its lack of \u201ctransparency.\u201d Giuliani cited the \u201cDemocrat crooked machine of Philadelphia,\u201d and claimed that there was no way to know if ballots had been cast legally. \u201cThey could be from Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe Biden could have voted fifty times, as far as we know, or five thousand times.\u201d Eric Trump said that polling places in Pennsylvania had been covered in Biden campaign posters, and that ballots had been discovered in drainage ditches, claims for which he provided no proof. Still, based on these claims, the Trump campaign was seeking an emergency injunction to stop the count."], "authors": ["Eliza Griswold", "Eliza Griswol", "Benjamin Wallace-Well"], "keywords": ["biden", "pennsylvania", "pennsylvanias", "mailin", "blue", "trump", "ballots", "shift", "stop", "rise", "votes", "count", "election"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
