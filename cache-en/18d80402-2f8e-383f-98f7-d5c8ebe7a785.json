Activists have long called for changes to Pornhub\u2019s business model, claiming it was not carrying out sufficient checks to ensure videos were consensual.", "Pornhub, visited by users 100m times a day, has denied a systemic problem with child abuse videos on the site, and said the New York Times claims were \u201cirresponsible and flagrantly untrue\u201d.", "Since the allegations were reported, credit card company Mastercard has said it is reviewing its relationship with the site.", "In its statement on the proposed changes, Pornhub says that from now on it will: \u201conly allow properly identified users to upload content.
