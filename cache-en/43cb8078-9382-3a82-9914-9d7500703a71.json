Calder\u00f3n hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico\u2019s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed. Kingpin strategy Simultaneously Calder\u00f3n also began pursuing the so-called \u201ckingpin strategy\u201d by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders.
