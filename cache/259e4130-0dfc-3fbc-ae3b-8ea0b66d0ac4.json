Game Informer gave it a 10, and today we're revisiting it on a live episode of Replay to determine who was right and who was wrong, and hopefully even find out if opinions are subjective!", "So, watch the episode above for a rousing hour of aimless wandering, unrestrained Groose adoration, and a baffling Ben Reeves moment that left Andrew Reiner, Joe Juba, and Leo Vader speechless. We also discuss the hypothetical Zelda games we would make, whether or not Link should have a voice, and (for some reason) Topher Grace. It really is a very special episode, so don't miss it.", "And follow us over on YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, Twitter, or Facebook to be notified when we go live with our next episode!"], "authors": ["Video Editor", "Leo Joined Game Informer'S Video Team In", "Hasn'T Stopped Chiming In The Booth Since.
