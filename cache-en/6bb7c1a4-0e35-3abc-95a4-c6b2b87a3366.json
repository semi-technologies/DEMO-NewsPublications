I believe that only with a special counsel can we uncover just how deeply and broadly the Chinese Communist Party has gotten its hooks into our ruling elites. If the Chinese can bribe the former vice president\u2019s son, they will go after anyone.", "And it\u2019s obvious that a Justice Department headed by an attorney general selected by Joe Biden will not be eager to investigate and possibly prosecute the son of the president. President-elect Biden has already come to his son\u2019s defense. So it is a clear and blatant conflict of interest for anyone appointed by Joe Biden to run an investigation of Hunter Biden.", "KT MCFARLAND: THERE IS 'SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE' HUNTER BIDEN HAS BEEN 'COMPROMISED BY CHINESE'", "We now have abundant evidence of China\u2019s influence operations targeting American politicians, academics, business executives and other influential people to serve as China\u2019s cheerleaders and apologists. China has co-opted them with money, contracts, donations, and in some cases even sexual favors.", "Just last week it was revealed that 2 million Chinese Communist Party members have been sent abroad to infiltrate and embed themselves in multinational organizations, foreign governments and global businesses.", "The intelligence community estimates that China steals $600 billion a year in American intellectual property. As Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe recently explained, China\u2019s goal is to \"rob, replicate and replace\" American products.", "China has hacked into personal, medical and financial files of half the American population. We\u2019re not sure why, but some believe it is to create a massive database to use in artificial intelligence.", "Others believe China is acting to create a file on every American similar to what the Chinese Communist Party has done with every Chinese citizen. The party uses this information to stifle criticism and ensure conformity.", "Chinese officials openly brag that for 40 years they have cultivated \"friends\" at the highest levels of the American elites. Is Hunter Biden one of these friends?", "It is of the utmost and urgent importance that we discover what the Chinese Communists are doing, who they have targeted and how we can stop them from continuing this hostile action directed against the United States.", "Finally, a transparent look at influence peddling could go a long way toward healing the divisions in the country today. Half of America distrusts the other half. Half of our citizens believe the 2016 election was stolen the other half believe the 2020 election was stolen.", "A significant percentage of our people think President-elect Biden is compromised by the Chinese government; just as a significant percentage of the country thinks President Trump was compromised by the Russians.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER", "America has not been this divided since the Civil War. We cannot go on like this. Faith in our elections, institutions and leaders are prerequisites for our democracy to survive.", "Our government needs to show the American people that no one is above the law, and it needs to be open and transparent about foreign influence peddling. We are past the point where our people automatically trust our leaders to do the right thing.", "There are serious claims against the Biden family that will dog the Biden presidency. President-elect Biden himself should want to clear his family\u2019s name of these grave allegations.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "If a special counsel finds no evidence of wrongdoing we can all move on. But if there is something to these charges, the American people deserve to know who they have elected as president and whether he has been compromised by a foreign power.", "As usual, sunlight is the best disinfectant.
