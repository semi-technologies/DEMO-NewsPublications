When the pressure eases up\u2014like when you're floating through powder or cruising slowly\u2014the HDT strips soften and the ski regains a bit of the flexibility you want at those times.

This combination of materials gives the skis extra stiffness, keeping the skier in control even through icy turns. The shape of the i.Titan is aimed more at all-mountain skiing than aggressive speed runs, with wider tips and tails that let them float over powdery snow. Look for graphene to show up in more sports equipment in the coming years; the material can make just about anything stronger and lighter, from tennis rackets to Formula 1 cars.", "$1,200", "Stylist: Heather Rosner", "When you buy something using the retail links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission.
