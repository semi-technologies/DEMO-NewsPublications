As of early Thursday, Mr. Biden led Mr. Trump in Maricopa County by 74,514 votes, almost 11,000 fewer than the previous update on Wednesday night. About 5 percent of the total vote remains to be counted there. Statewide, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump by less than three percentage points. Maricopa County\u2019s next update will come after 9 p.m. Eastern on Thursday. In the two batches of results released by the county late Wednesday and early Thursday, Mr. Trump won by a margin of about 57 to 40, which experts have said is what he needs to win the state. But Mr. Trump would also have to receive at least 57 percent of votes that remain to be counted in other parts of the state as well, including counties that tend to vote Democratic. Mr. Biden\u2019s narrow edge underscored a profound political shift in Arizona, a longtime Republican bastion that has lurched left in recent years, fueled by rapidly evolving demographics and a growing contingent of young Latino voters who favor liberal policies. Scores of Trump supporters who are suspicious of the early results favoring Mr. Biden gathered outside the Maricopa County election office on Wednesday, delaying the final announcement of the night amid security concerns.

Audra Melton for The New York Times ATLANTA \u2014 The presidential race in Georgia appeared headed for a photo finish as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. steadily gained ground on President Trump. The victor will be awarded 16 electoral votes. Mr. Biden had begun Wednesday morning approximately 100,000 votes behind Mr. Trump, but as county elections workers around the state continued the laborious tabulation of absentee ballots into Thursday morning, Mr. Trump\u2019s lead narrowed to 24,000 votes, or 0.5 percent. Under Georgia election law, a candidate may request a recount if the margin is 0.5 or less. In Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold and home to most of Atlanta, Mr. Biden narrowed the margin by more than 18,000 votes between 5 p.m. and midnight as the work of processing and tabulating the votes continued. In DeKalb County, also part of the metropolitan region, Mr. Biden narrowed it by an additional 5,000. The next update from Georgia\u2019s secretary of state is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Thursday. Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, said that as of 10:15 p.m. on Wednesday, there were about 90,735 ballots that still needed to be counted. More than a third of them are in Fulton and DeKalb counties. If the trajectory of Mr. Biden\u2019s gains continued, it appeared he could overtake Mr. Trump in Georgia by the final tally on Thursday. The question was whether additional absentee votes from rural and more Republican areas would offset enough of Mr. Biden\u2019s gains to preserve Mr. Trump\u2019s lead. Republicans in Georgia were nervously assessing the vote count and promised to file lawsuits in a dozen or more counties aimed at knocking off votes here and there. The first case, filed in Savannah on Wednesday, was an effort to chisel away 53 ballots that Georgia Republicans said had arrived too late to be counted.

Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times PHOENIX \u2014 Just a decade ago, Maricopa County embodied Arizona\u2019s status as a Republican bastion. Politicians like Joe Arpaio, the tough-talking sheriff who was long a fixture in the county that includes the Phoenix suburbs, thrived in large part because of their ability to appeal to voters while taking a hard line on immigration, guns, religion and taxes. But with Arizona emerging as a tempting target for Democrats, Maricopa\u2019s election results are shattering that perception in what may amount to one of the biggest political shifts of any major county in the United States in recent years. Image Credit... The New York Times \u201cRight now, Maricopa is tangibly, unabashedly, demonstrably a Democratic county, something I never thought I would see in my lifetime,\u201d said Stan Barnes, 59, a longtime Republican strategist in Phoenix. With 88 percent of the vote counted on Wednesday night, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. led President Trump by about five percentage points in Maricopa on Wednesday night, and by almost three points statewide, though his advantage narrowed slightly with the most recent set of vote totals. The last time the county supported a Democrat for president was in 1948, and as recently as 2012, Mitt Romney carried it by 11 percentage points. But there is now a considerable list of elected positions in the county that have been held by Democrats, including county recorder, sheriff, assessor and school superintendent. \u201cIt just blows my mind,\u201d Mr. Barnes said. Various factors have contributed to the political reconfiguration in the county, which began to take shape by 2016, when Mr. Arpaio was defeated and Hillary Clinton lost the county by just three percentage points. It accelerated in 2018 with Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s flip of a U.S. Senate seat into Democratic hands. And it turned into a potential game-changer this week, as the county provided a crucial boost to Mr. Biden\u2019s bid for the presidency. With about 4.5 million people, Maricopa accounts for almost 60 percent of Arizona\u2019s population. Those factors include a serious backlash \u2014 including within the powerful Republican business community \u2014 against state and national crackdowns on immigrants. Latino activists, infuriated by racial profiling that accompanied the crackdowns, led voter registration drives. The county has also had an influx of more liberal voters from other states, notably California. Sam Salazar, 32, a foreman for a drywall company in Maryvale, a heavily Latino area of Maricopa, said he started out a few years ago as a fan of Mr. Trump. But his sister, he said, eventually persuaded him to vote Democrat this year for the first time. \u201cBiden is for masks, for taking care of people,\u201d Mr. Salazar added. \u201cTrump, well, Trump\u2019s for himself.\u201d Read more", "Nov. 4, 2020, 9:02 p.m. ET Nov. 4, 2020, 9:02 p.m. ET By Richard Fausset and As the race in Georgia tightens, the Trump campaign sues over 53 ballots in one county. \u201cI voted\u201d stickers in Georgia on Tuesday.

Audra Melton for The New York Times Signaling a willingness to litigate even the most minute of possible voting discrepancies, President Trump\u2019s campaign filed suit in Georgia\u2019s Chatham County on Wednesday, claiming that a Republican poll watcher there \u201cwitnessed 53 late absentee ballots illegally added to a stack of on-time absentee ballots.\u201d The lawsuit, filed in Chatham County Superior Court on behalf of the Georgia Republican Party and President Trump\u2019s campaign, came as the race in Georgia had tightened significantly. It raised the possibility that some absentee ballots had been improperly handled and received after Tuesday\u2019s 7 p.m. deadline. Chatham County, in coastal southeast Georgia, includes the city of Savannah. The chairman of Georgia\u2019s Republican Party, David Shafer, said Wednesday that his group plans to file lawsuits in as many as a dozen Georgia counties over potential irregularities in the way local election boards are handling absentee ballots. \u201cWhen an unlawful ballot is counted that suppresses the vote of a lawful voter just as thoroughly as if that voter was physically barred from the polls,\u201d Mr. Shafer said in a telephone interview. His remarks came as President Trump\u2019s once-sizable lead in Georgia had been cut to about 46,000 votes by Wednesday evening, and as some predicted he was about to fall behind his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr. Fulton County \u2014 which is the state\u2019s most populous and includes most of Atlanta, a reliable Democratic stronghold \u2014 is expected to finish counting its absentee ballots overnight, said Richard L. Barron, the elections director. The Chatham County lawsuit contended that a poll watcher named Sean Pumphrey had said he \u201cwitnessed absentee ballots that had not been properly processed apparently mixed into a pile of absentee ballots that was already set to be tabulated.\u201d According to the lawsuit, Mr. Pumphrey \u201cobserved a poll worker bring a stack of ballots from a back room and place on a table near the bins,\u201d he said in a sworn affidavit. Of those, a stack of 53, he later learned, were ballots that had come in after the 7 p.m. deadline when polls officially closed. He then briefly left the room, he said. \u201cWhen I returned to the room the stack of ballots were no longer on the table,\u201d he said. In his statement, Mr. Pumphrey surmised those 53 may have been improperly counted with other ballots. A spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Georgia did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Asked about the Chatham County lawsuit, Richard Barron, the elections director in Fulton County, said he wasn\u2019t aware of it, but, referring to his own county\u2019s ballots, he said: \u201cThese are all valid votes because they were all received yesterday.\u201d According to a statement by Justin Clark, the Trump campaign\u2019s senior counsel, the lawsuit\u2019s ultimate goal is for \u201call Georgia counties to separate any and all late-arriving ballots from all legally cast ballots to ensure a free, fair election in which only legal, valid ballots count.\u201d Sean Keenan contributed reporting from Atlanta.

Agins/The New York Times PITTSBURGH \u2014 Pennsylvania, the state with the largest trove of electoral votes still up for grabs, inched ahead in its counting of more than one million outstanding mail-in ballots on Wednesday, a majority of them from Democratic strongholds, as Joseph R. Biden cut into his deficit with President Trump. With narrow wins in Wisconsin and Michigan called on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden has flipped two of the three northern industrial states that handed Mr. Trump the White House in 2016. The third, Pennsylvania, loomed as a battleground that Mr. Trump must win again to secure re-election; if Mr. Biden won the state, it would put him over the top. Officials from each party vigorously made their cases that the composition of the uncounted mail-in votes ensured that a Pennsylvania victory was at hand for their candidate, though state officials warned that the counting would continue for days. Democrats pointed to hundreds of thousands of uncounted ballots in Philadelphia and its suburbs, and to the fact that the mail-in votes had so far run four to one in Mr. Biden\u2019s favor. By Wednesday evening, Mr. Biden\u2019s deficit had shrunk from more than 10 percentage points to 3, or about 200,000 votes. \u201cBiden probably wins the state by roughly 100,000,\u201d predicted Rich Fitzgerald, the Democratic county executive of Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. But Bill Stepien, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, argued that Democrats were overstating how much Mr. Biden would gain from urban and suburban ballots, and underestimating the remaining ballots in more conservative counties, including York, Butler and Blair. Lawyers for the Trump campaign have descended on the state to mount court challenges. Republicans have filed multiple lawsuits, questioning how voters were notified of issues with mail-in ballots and allowed to cast provisional ballots. Hearings were held both in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, and at the state level. The Trump campaign also said it would file a suit to stop the counting of mail-in ballots, claiming election officials were not allowing party observers to closely monitor the process, particularly in Philadelphia \u2014 a charge that the officials flatly denied. And the campaign moved to intervene in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, hoping to stop ballots postmarked by Election Day, but received up to three days later, from being counted. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, condemned the legal maneuvers. \u201cOur election officials at the state and local level should be free to do their jobs without intimidation or attacks,\u201d Mr. Wolf said in a statement. \u201cThese attempts to subvert the democratic process are disgraceful.\u201d Read more", "Nov. 4, 2020, 8:04 p.m. ET Nov. 4, 2020, 8:04 p.m. ET By In photos: Across the country, demonstrators make the case for a full count.

Since then, Nevada has only become a deeper blue, with Democrats controlling the governor\u2019s office and legislature, both Senate seats and all but one House seat. In 2020, Nevada was considered so weighted toward the Democrats that it made few political strategists\u2019 lists of battleground states, and both Mr. Biden and President Trump spent little time here. The state was so overlooked that one of Nevada\u2019s leading political journalists, Jon Ralston, months ago started a plaintive Twitter hashtag: #wematter.
