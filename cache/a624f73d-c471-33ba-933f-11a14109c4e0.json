And yet this moment requires more than a nostalgia for the days of \u201ctolerance for uncongenial expression.\u201d The problem is with discourse itself: liberal values such as open debate and artistic license have been short-circuited. The clash with fascism is not a difference of opinion that can be hashed out with mutual respect. Guston\u2019s swastika and Ku Klux Klan imagery meant something very different just four years ago, before the election of Donald Trump, who has abetted white supremacists. Better not to show the paintings at all than to give such people the opportunity to pose before them for selfies.", "Luke Jaeger", "Northampton, Mass.", "It pains me to take issue with Schjeldahl and his subtle support for the institutions that postponed the \u201cPhilip Guston Now\u201d show. But it seems to me that his analysis and, by extension, that of the museum officials responsible for the delay, mischaracterize the work: Guston\u2019s paintings are not so much a condemnation of the Ku Klux Klan as an indictment of white society for being made of the same clay. Guston looked in the mirror and said, We are all Klansmen now. That is a message that white \u00e9lites, however liberal and cultured, will always wish to run away from.", "Sheridan Swinson", "Leominster, England", "My Name Is Marlinspike", "Anna Wiener\u2019s Profile of Moxie Marlinspike, who founded Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging service, presents a rare example of ethical technology in the age of surveillance capitalism (\u201cPrivacy Settings,\u201d October 26th). I research and teach on the power and responsibility of Big Tech, and I struggle to find model companies to show my students. Wiener compellingly illustrates how Marlinspike\u2019s pro-privacy efforts have grown out of anarchist and punk cultures. Situated in the context of those fringe movements, Marlinspike\u2019s vision is intriguing as a potential paradigm for mainstream privacy norms online. When accepting an award in 2017, Marlinspike said that we should celebrate technological progress, and not the individuals who brought it about. Wiener\u2019s piece explains why, when it comes to subverting surveillance practices and making the Internet a more ethical place, the two cannot be separated.", "Swati Srivastava", "Assistant Professor of Political Science", "Purdue University", "West Lafayette, Ind.", "Wiener mentions that the origins of Marlinspike\u2019s chosen surname are mysterious. Attentive readers of Hilary Mantel\u2019s historical novel \u201cWolf Hall\u201d know the name: Marlinspike is the kitten born in the rooms of Cardinal Wolsey, whom Thomas Cromwell, the book\u2019s hero, served as confidential secretary. Cromwell brings the kitten home and, holding it out to his son, proclaims, \u201cI am a giant, my name is Marlinspike.\u201d", "Aviva Cantor", "New York City", "Is it possible that Wiener does not know Tintin, the young reporter-adventurer of comic-book fame, whose sidekick Captain Haddock, through a series of fortuitous events, ends up as the wealthy owner of Marlinspike Hall?
