Vitamin A reserves are mostly stored in the liver. Once cold was applied to the mice in the study, the increases in \"the levels of vitamin A and its blood transporter, retinol-binding protein\" led to a higher rate of fat burning as the white fat converted to brown as the body attempting to keep itself warm.", "Alternatively, when \u201cthe vitamin A transporter \u2018retinol-binding protein\u2019\u201d was blocked in mice, the fat did not \u201cbrown\u201d and the mice were unable to protect themselves from the cold.", "FITNESS INFLUENCER SHOWS HOW 'BEFORE AND AFTER' PHOTOS ARE MANIPULATED", "The study is promising in finding solutions to dealing with weight gain and obesity.

However, this is not an argument for consuming large amounts of vitamin A supplements if not prescribed, because it is critical that vitamin A is transported to the right cells at the right time,\" explains the MedUni Vienna researcher. \"We have discovered a new mechanism by which vitamin A regulates lipid combustion and heat generation in cold conditions. This could help us to develop new therapeutic interventions that exploit this specific mechanism.\""], "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "keywords": ["white", "shows", "mice", "burn", "burning", "temperatures", "cold", "body", "study", "vitamin", "fat", "help", "brown", "stored"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
