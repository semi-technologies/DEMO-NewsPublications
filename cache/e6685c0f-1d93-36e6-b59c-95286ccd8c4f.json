No, I\u2019m not talking about the time of the NES, when Contra first burst onto the scene. I\u2019m not talking about the time periods in which the series saw sequels on the Genesis and SNES, either. Rogue Corps is reminiscent of the early part of last-gen \u2013 more specifically, the early part of the Xbox 360\u2019s lifespan, which saw a deluge of poorly executed garbage games. I haven\u2019t played through the entirety of Rogue Corps, but I\u2019ve played enough to say that it\u2019s not worth your attention. I\u2019m moving on, and I highly recommend you do the same.", "Rogue Corps is a twin-stick shooter, which is a genre I usually adore. Almost immediately after getting my hands on the game, I could tell something was off. Rogue Corps controls horribly, with multiple dead zones when you try to aim your shots with the right stick. Even after turning off the aim assists, I had a hard time precisely lining up targets. When you\u2019re constantly being swarmed by drones (or trying to pick off enemies at a distance) it\u2019s frustrating to see your shots harmlessly whizzing past. Considering that every shot contributes to an overheat gauge, every shot counts.", "Rogue Corp positions itself as a cheesy, bombastic fragfest; one of the four playable heroes is a machine-gun-toting panda, so you can immediately tell it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. That sense of freewheeling fun is completely absent from the actual gameplay, though its attempts at creating setpiece moments are laughable. In one moment, you\u2019re chased by a giant ball. It moves so slowly that the only real tension was between weaving through parked cars and trying to figure out a better use of my time. As it turned out, the correct answer was \u201cvirtually anything at all.\u201d", "There\u2019s a kernel of a good idea with weapon upgrades, but it desperately needs to be retuned. Enemies drop weapon parts, which you retrieve at the end of a level. There, you can research new tech or improve the weapons you have equipped by essentially disenchanting the unwanted parts. I didn\u2019t notice any measurable improvements from those upgrades, since stat bonuses are measured to the hundredth decimal place. Getting new weapons can be a boon, but you\u2019re subject to the luck of the draw. Hopefully an enemy drops an interesting component, because buying one in the in-game store is often prohibitively expensive. One interesting laser would have required me to replay a stage several dozen times to get enough gold. Nope! I did find a gauss gun that fired bouncing orbs \u2013 perfect for clearing out the myriad kill rooms that make up the bulk of the uninspired levels. That newfound sense of power didn\u2019t salvage the plain fact that I was still using it in levels that were awkwardly structured, uninspired, and flat-out ugly.", "I appreciate the allure of so-called \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d gaming. This ain\u2019t it, though. EDF has an unbelievably corny setup and amateurish production values, but it\u2019s a perfectly functional shooter. Deadly Premonition is similarly cheesy, but it has heart and personality. Rogue Corps isn\u2019t fun, interesting, or engaging. It\u2019s an embarrassing mess that should be avoided. If you and your buddies want to just play something dumb to laugh at, there are many other, better options out there. Options that don\u2019t require that you con them into picking up multiple copies of the game, too.", "You see, you can play local co-op in Rogue Corps, but you and your friends are cordoned off to a side mode. There, you can\u2019t progress the campaign. Instead, they\u2019re similar to the rifts in Diablo III, randomized strings of rooms and bosses designed to be replayed. Considering how grindy the game can be, it\u2019s not a bad idea. The thing is, however, only the host gets to keep the accumulated loot and XP. Lame. I tried to play online, and there weren\u2019t any lobbies that I could join. Considering that it launched today, that\u2019s not exactly a great sign.", "I\u2019ve spent about nine hours playing this game, and have no idea how many more stages are left until the end. I do know that levels are recycled only a few levels into the campaign, even to the point of putting the collectibles in identical locations. I don\u2019t see a future in which the back half of Contra: Rogue Corps makes up for the abysmal first half. It would be irresponsible to assign a numerical score to something I didn\u2019t complete, but all you need to know is that it\u2019s irredeemably bad. Move along, folks."]}
