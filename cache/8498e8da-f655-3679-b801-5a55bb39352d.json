Rolling out dough takes up a bit of space, so clear off those countertops before you begin.", "\u2022 Use parchment paper for rolling for best results (though a well-floured work surface will also work). To roll out the dough, you\u2019ll want to lightly dust a large piece of parchment paper with flour. Roll out the dough until it starts to stick a bit to the parchment, then lightly dust the top of the dough with a bit more flour and cover it with another piece of parchment. Flip the whole thing over, peeling off the bottom piece (and saving it so you can repeat this process).", "\u2022 Keep an eye on the thickness of the dough. You want it to be about the thickness of a graham cracker, or, if you have a ruler handy, no thinner than an eighth of an inch. Don\u2019t worry about making it a perfect circle or rectangle.", "\u2022 Cold is best. Regardless of the shape you\u2019re cutting out, or the method you\u2019re using (by hand, with a cutter, glass jar), you\u2019ll want the dough to be chilled. If it gets too warm and flimsy, it\u2019ll be challenging to cut out clean shapes and move. Put the dough back into the fridge to firm up if it starts to soften.", "\u2022 A cute cutter does not always make a cute cookie. No matter how appealing the wide range of cutters may be, there are some that don\u2019t actually make great cookies. In particular, avoid shapes with small, delicate features. Those smaller parts of dough are doomed to tragedy: getting stuck in the cutters, burning before the rest of the cookie is baked through, or just breaking off. And they\u2019re challenging to decorate.", "\u2022 Broad cookies make better canvases. Shapes with a lot of surface area (circles, triangles, diamonds, stars) yield the greatest success. They bake more evenly and offer multiple decorating options."]}
