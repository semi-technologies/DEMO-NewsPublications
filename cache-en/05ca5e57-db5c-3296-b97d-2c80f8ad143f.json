In 1989 she burst onto the scene as the hyper-driven Jessie Spano in Saved by the Bell, NBC\u2019s Saturday-morning series that turned into a pop culture phenomenon. Three decades later, and the actress is revisiting the role that launched her career thanks to a reboot that catches up with the beloved Bayside students and their high-school-age children.", "The continued nostalgia for the \u201990s has meant a renaissance for everything from the eerie Lynchian drama of Twin Peaks to the pure soap of Aaron Spelling creations like 90210 and Melrose Place. If a show was on air during the Clinton administration, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s currently being revived, reimagined, or turned into a Zoom reunion, so it was only a matter of time before Saved by the Bell returned to the small screen. This time around, though, Berkley Lauren and her costars Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Mario Lopez, and Tiffani Thiessen serve as producers and are involved in every detail.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t plan for these full-circle moments, and I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re so meaningful,\u201d shared Berkley Lauren on the phone from Los Angeles. \u201cWe were 15 or 16 when we first played these characters, and it was such a joyful experience when we first did it, but there was also this innocence. We were at the beginning of seeing our dreams come true and experiencing this together. So being back at Bayside now is surreal.\u201d", "Debuting after comedy\u2019s teen explosion of the 1980s, which saw the rise of John Hughes films and series like Square Pegs, Saved by the Bell filled a void for kids who\u2019d outgrown cartoons but weren\u2019t quite ready for adult programming. While many of its characters represented familiar tropes\u2014sweetheart cheerleaders, class clowns, and jocks among them\u2014Berkley Lauren\u2019s Jessie Spano was a fresh archetype. Depicted as intelligent, opinionated, and beautiful, she advocated for social justice causes and volunteered while prepping for a Stanford degree. We\u2019re now used to seeing young women depicted as well-rounded and ambitious, but circa 1989, the options were limited. For the show\u2019s audience and its star, Spano felt new. \u201cYou had a 15-year-old girl using her voice as an activist, feminist, and someone who advocates for others,\u201d says Berkley Lauren. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t something you\u2019d see on television at that time. She was fearless, and I think in our culture, many young women are taught to apologize for speaking up and using their voices. My mother and the women who were around me growing up were forces; they instilled that confidence in me, so I was always proud to have played a character like Jessie.\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["spano", "renaissance", "lauren", "mission", "jessie", "showgirls", "bell", "girls", "using", "young", "berkley", "saved", "help", "women", "turned", "reboot", "elizabeth", "teen"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
