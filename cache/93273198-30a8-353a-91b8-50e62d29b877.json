{"id": "93273198-30a8-353a-91b8-50e62d29b877", "pubDate": null, "paragraphs": ["The rise of the Kardashian-Jenner clan has been one of the more unlikely phenomena to emerge from the reality TV boom of the past decade: Across the years, fans have witnessed their ongoing style evolution, with each sister (and of course, momager Kris) carving out their own distinct sartorial identities. Part of this appeal also lies in their reluctance to wear the same look twice, making it impossible to predict what their next headline-grabbing outfit will be.", "With this constant rotation of looks comes a logistical problem, however: Where to store their ever-growing inventories of designer clothes? Thankfully, they seem to have found the answer\u2014and their fans can now reap the benefits. Launching today, the family has introduced the world to their latest fashion venture, Kardashian Kloset, a resale site featuring clothes organized by each member of the clan. It isn\u2019t their first time at the resale rodeo, either\u2014lest we forget, Kim first entered the public consciousness as a friend of Paris Hilton\u2019s on The Simple Life, back when her main career was clearing the closets of the rich and famous and selling them on eBay.", "Naturally, the items on offer reflect the personal tastes of each of the individual family members. Kim\u2019s includes items such as a form-fitting, nude-colored Balmain minidress, and a glitzy sequin Roberto Cavalli gown with a beaded fringe, no doubt a fashion prize from the days when Kim was known for her blingy style. If you\u2019re looking for the more avant-garde, often archival designer items Kim prefers these days, then there\u2019s an edgier and very revealing vintage Martin Margiela open weave dress. (Not sure what to wear underneath it? Well, Kim has an answer for that too: see her newly-launched shapewear line, Skims.)", "Kylie, meanwhile, has a more youthful selection with plenty of Alexander Wang, Vetements, and Off-White for those seeking streetwear bargains. There\u2019s a particularly eye-catching pair of Balenciaga sock booties in pink velvet: While the style usually retails at $1,290, here you can pick them up for a cool $750. Plus, of course, they come with the conversation starter that they were once worn by Kylie Jenner.", "Kris\u2019s offering is similarly reflective of her personal style, with the largest selection available out of all the family. In other words, expect a wellspring of sleek tailoring, caftans, and dramatic outerwear. The best steals are in Kris\u2019s extensive catalogue of little black dresses: take this Riccardo Tisci\u2013era Givenchy balloon-sleeve number, or this classic Chanel look in a luxurious wool-cashmere blend with quilted leather patch pockets. If you\u2019re in the market for something more casual, there\u2019s also (a little bizarrely) an extensive range of pre-owned Adidas tracksuits in Kris\u2019s section\u2014now you can work out like a Kardashian, too.", "While Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney\u2019s pieces for the site are yet to be released, there are still plenty of bargains to be had in the meantime. So what are you waiting for?
