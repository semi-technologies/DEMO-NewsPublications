But there is no government guarantee to back up the word \u201cnatural\u201d on a label. You must read on to find out if the bird is antibiotic-free, free-range and/or raised on a vegetarian diet.", "Kosher: Turkeys with the \u201ckosher\u201d label have been farmed and slaughtered according to Jewish dietary customs, with rabbinical supervision. They also undergo a salting process after slaughter that gives the meat a juicy texture. (Don\u2019t brine a kosher bird.)", "Conventional: This is the standard supermarket turkey. The variety is the Broad Breasted White, which was bred to have a plumper, broader breast. A conventional turkey should be brined; it will noticeably improve the texture. And use an open hand when it comes to seasonings, since the turkey won\u2019t offer much flavor of its own.", "Heritage: Heritage turkeys are old-fashioned varieties of birds that were common in America until the 1920s. They have a richer, more distinct flavor, more like a game bird, and have a greater proportion of dark meat. Breeds include Narragansett, Jersey Buff, Standard Bronze, Bourbon Red and White Holland.", "Wild Turkey: It is illegal in the United States to sell a truly wild turkey that\u2019s been shot by a hunter, thus most \u201cwild\u201d turkeys on the market are pasture-raised \u2014 often free-range heritage birds. To procure a truly wild turkey you will need to either shoot one yourself or befriend a hunter.", "Self-basting: These turkeys have been injected with a solution generally consisting of butter or oil and salt, and sometimes herbs, spices and preservatives. Self-basted turkeys are sometimes not labeled as such, so make sure to check the ingredients list. If you see anything other than \u201cturkey,\u201d chances are it is a self-basting bird. Do not brine it."]}
