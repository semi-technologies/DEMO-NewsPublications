Beeld Marie Wanders", "On the last Thursday before their summer holiday, a small group of five- and six-year olds stood in a row imitating the choreography of child pop choir Kinderen voor Kinderen. While muting the laptop that showed the video for their hit song \u201cPasapas\u201d, teacher Tamako Suzuki played audio from another laptop to which the children sang not in Dutch, but in Japanese. Suzuki, a freelance composer originally from Tokyo, translated the lyrics into her mother tongue and what she is helping cultivate as a second, if not third, language for children who attend the course she created. The youngsters live in Amstelveen and Amsterdam and come from what Suzuki calls \u2018mixed families\u2019: Dutch-Japanese, American-Japanese and, referring to her own two daughters, Bulgarian-Japanese.", "Meeting at Amstelveen\u2019s De Bolder community center\u2014where dart club gatherings, Rollator checks and Bollywood dance workshops are among the regular leisure activities on the monthly calendar\u2014Suzuki\u2019s group appears as much a part of Amstelveen society as other subcultures.", "Yet, the Japanese community \u2018is very closed, like a big family,\u2019 she says, with a laugh that seems to acknowledge how being family-like has both pros and cons. \u201cMost of the families stay here only a few years. I\u2019m afraid that a lot of Japanese people don\u2019t get so much in touch with the locals. They don\u2019t have to talk so much with them.\u201d", "It is \u201ceasy to communicate with other Japanese people here. There are also Japanese playgroups,\u201d she notes, naming one of the many outlets that encourage self-sufficiency and permit even the short-term residents to \u201csatisfy their social lives for only few years.\u201d", "Suzuki, who is 41, has lived in Amstelveen since 2014, and estimates that as many as 80 percent of her friends in town are Japanese. Still, she is eager to bridge enclaves.", "\u201cOf course not everyone is closed off,\u201d she points out. \u201cSome Japanese people like to have contact with local people.\u201d Suzuki regularly tries to engage such friends, for example, as she did by leading a spring outing to the 24H Amstelveen event. \u201cOr sometimes I do a barbecue in the Amsterdamse Bos with Dutch families or international families, so I invite Japanese people to join.\u201d", "But she is cautious. \u201cI don\u2019t say it directly, but just suggest: \u2018Let\u2019s go to this event together.\u2019\u201d This is because, in her observation, Japanese culture is \u201csometimes, I feel too polite.\u201d Even in Amstelveen, \u201cit is difficult to say something. Sometimes I have to be as polite as though I were in Japan.\u201d", "A distinct departure from life in Japan, however, is having more free time. Back in Tokyo, \u201cit was super busy,\u201d she recalls, typically having \u201cjust three hours sleeping each night and then work, work, work.\u201d Suzuki moved to Europe 11 years ago, first living in Paris, then in Hilversum, Utrecht and Maarssen. Her profession involves scoring everything from arrangements for singers to soundtracks for smartphone games, mostly for clients in Japan though she hopes to find more assignments closer to home.", "Needing better life balance is also what motivated Suzuki to start the children\u2019s course this past April. The idea came about after the elder of her daughters outgrew a Japanese kindergarten in Amstelveen. A supplementary Japanese school and a Japanese language course are offered locally on Saturdays or Sundays, she clarifies, \u201cbut I want to spend time with family in the weekend.\u201d Plus, her daughters were already devoting some of their Sundays to Bulgarian school to keep connected to their father\u2019s heritage.", "Putting a Japanese spin on a Kinderen voor Kinderen hit is one example of how Suzuki and her co-instructor, Chie Arita, who focuses on the language component of the lessons, fill the students\u2019 free time with culturally fitting\u2014yet fun\u2014activities. It helps, too, that Kinderen voor Kinderen singer Ayana Voss is part Japanese and can speak Japanese. \u201cShe is a super hero for my students,\u201d says Suzuki.", "It is not only content, but also approach, that carries a Dutch touch.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to give the lessons in a very Japanese way because my students speak Dutch very well. This is their first language and mother language, and should be. So I don\u2019t want to separate their Dutch culture from their Japanese culture. We can combine,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t say: \u2018This is the right way\u2019 or \u2018this is the wrong way\u2019\u2014that is more Japanese in style\u2026 I don\u2019t want to give them stress.\u201d", "The low-stress attitude prevails at her daughter\u2019s school as well.", "\u201cI see a lot of smiles there,\u201d she indicates of the students, the teachers and fellow parents. Another better aspect of everyday life in the Netherlands is school lunch. \u201cIn just 30 seconds I can prepare it!\u201d she says of her family\u2019s standard broodje ham-kaas. Referring to Japan\u2019s famously elaborate bento boxes, she balks: \u201cHave you ever seen one? Parents wake up at 5 or 5:30 in the morning, every morning, to make their children\u2019s lunch. I cannot do this.\u201d", "Relations are more horizontal between generations at home, too. According to Suzuki, there is always a back-and-forth between children saying \u201cI want, I want!\u201d and parents who must reply \u201cNee!\u201d Relaying this, she uses her hands to make the form of two talking mouths. When she enacts the dialogue between parents and children in Japan versus parents and children in the Netherlands, the height of her hands changes. For Japan, she holds one hand higher, angled downwards at the other, and for the Netherlands her hands are parallel.", "When describing how she thinks some of her compatriots see her choice to marry the Bulgarian man she met in a Dutch course at community college and to send their daughters to Dutch school, she laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t have a typical Japanese character, actually. No, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, I think. I feel more comfortable here.\u201d", "As for her six year old, now starting group 3 in school, Suzuki shares: \u201cShe asked me: \u2018Am I Japanese? Am I Dutch? Am I Bulgarian?\u2019 Actually I couldn\u2019t answer, but said: \u2018I think just mixed. You\u2019re a very international girl.\u2019\u201d"], "authors": ["Karina Hof", "Floris Vermeulen"], "keywords": ["dont", "kinderen", "parents", "suzuki", "daughters", "amstelveen", "dutch", "school", "feel", "character", "typical", "comfortable", "language", "japanese"], "pubDate": "2019-08-23T06:05:00Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
