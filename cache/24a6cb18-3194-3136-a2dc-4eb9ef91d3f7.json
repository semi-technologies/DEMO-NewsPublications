For a start, the whole project cost 200 billion yuan ($28.6 billion), took nearly two decades to build, and required uprooting more than a millionpeople along the Yangtze River. And while the government promised the dam wouldbe able to protect communities around its immediate downstream against a \"once in a century flood,\" its efficacy has frequentlybeen questioned.", "Those doubts recently resurfaced, as the Yangtze basin saw its heaviest average rainfall in nearly 60 years since June, causing the river and its many tributaries to overflow.", "More than 158 people have died or gone missing, 3.67 million residents have been displaced and 54.8 million people have been affected, causing a devastating 144 billion yuan ($20.5 billion) in economic losses.", "told China's state news agency Despite the havoc, Chinese authorities claim the Three Gorges Dam has succeeded in playing a \" crucial role \" in intercepting floodwaters. The dam's operator, China Three Gorges Corporation,told China's state news agency Xinhua that the dam has intercepted 18.2 billion cubic meters of potential floodwater.

The 660 kilometer (410 mile) reservoir winds upstream through the narrow valleys of the Three Gorges -- a series of steep canyons known for their imposing beauty and once treacherous currents -- to Chongqing, a sprawling municipality of 30.5 million people in western China.", "During the dry season, October to May, the reservoir's water level is kept at a maximum of 175 meters (574 feet) to optimize electricity generation at the adjoining hydropower plant. Before the summer rains arrive in June, it's gradually lowered to 145 meters (475 feet) to make room for the incoming floodwaters.", "The lowering of water levels creates 22 billion cubic meters of storage space -- enough to contain nearly 9 million Olympic-size swimming pools of water. But that's nothing compared with the sheer volume of floodwater that can flow into the dam during bad years, said Fan Xiao, a Chinese geologist and long-time critic of the dam.", "During a \"once-a-century flood\" more than 244 billion cubic meters of water -- or about twice the volume of the Dead Sea -- can pass through the Three Gorges in two months, according to Fan's calculations.", "The storage capacity of the dam's reservoir can handle only about 9% of that amount, he added.", "\"It's like using a small cup to deal with a big tub of water. In terms of flood control, the cost of the dam has surely outweighed the gain.\"", "Besides, the dam can only hold back the water for so long, as it has to make room for new rains -- and in flood season torrential downpours can come in quick succession.", "Last month, three flood waves have already hit the Three Gorges. The dam has opened its sluice gates multiple times since late June to release water from its reservoir, drawing criticism on Chinese social media that this exacerbated the floods downstream.", "delay and stagger the floodwaters reaching downstream.

For China's imperial rulers, the ability to harness rivers not only saved lives and brought prosperity, but also gave legitimacy to their reign, as natural disasters were taken as a sign that the emperor had lost the mandate of heaven, by which he ruled.", "This ambition to control water resources has only grown in modern times, with the prowess of technology.", "Every Chinese leader since Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China, dreamed of building a massive dam on the Yangtze, which has repeatedly wreaked havoc on its banks during flood season.", "In an industrial blueprint he laid out for the Republic of China in 1919, Sun envisioned damming the Three Gorges to improve navigation and provide hydropower for the whole country.", "The revolutionary leader did not live to see this dream realized. His successor Chiang Kai-shek carried on with the task in the 1940s, inviting renowned American engineer John L. Savage -- best known for his work on the Hoover Dam -- to survey the valleys and draw up a design for the Three Gorges Dam. Chiang even sent dozens of Chinese engineers to the US for training, but the project was abandoned during the Chinese Civil War.", "The faces of Chinese leaders Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin appear on a large mural of the Three Gorges Dam in Wuhan.

But his plans were disrupted by the turmoil of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.", "When his successor Deng Xiaoping brought up the idea again in the late 1970s, it was strongly opposed by some leading hydrologists, intellectuals and environmentalists, who pointed to its human and environmental costs, from the mass relocation of residents to threats of geological hazards, environmental damage and loss of archeological sites.", "\" It was heavily debated throughout the next decade, which was the most politically relaxed and liberal era in the history of Chinese Communist rule. But following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, open dissent was stifled and the political atmosphere turned oppressive. Four months after the massacre, authorities banned Yangtze! Yangtze! \" -- a book highly critical of the project -- and jailed its author, Dai Qing , a journalist and one of China's earliest environmentalists.", "Confident that it could now push through the plan, the government put the dam to a vote before the country's legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), in 1992. The dam was approved, but about one-third of the delegates refused to endorse the plan -- an astonishingly low approval rate for China's usually compliant rubber-stamp parliament.", "Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng (left) at the National People's Congress on March 21, 1992 in Beijing, China.

So no matter how we vote, we vote in blindness.\"", "Why is the dam so controversial?", "One of the most controversial aspects of the mega-project was its enormous cost for villagers who had lived for centuries on the banks of the river. To make way for the dam's massive reservoir, about 1.4 million people were uprooted, their ancestral homes demolished, communities broken up and farmlands flooded.", "Building the Three Gorges Dam displaced more people than the three largest Chinese dams before it combined. The reservoir submerged two cities, 114 towns and 1,680 villages along the river banks.", "Residents of Fengjie, in southwest China's Chongqing, watch the demolition of buildings in their town on November 4, 2002, to make room for the Three Gorges Dam's resevoir.

Many have accused local governments of embezzling resettlement funds and using excessive force to quell protests. In 2013, the Chinese government acknowledged that some of the funds were embezzled or misused.", "Many also faced a reduction in living wages. According to Chen Guojie, a scholar at the government-backed Chinese Academy of Sciences, incomes of migrant families dropped by 20% after relocating, as they were forced to abandon their fertile riverside flatlands to farm on the steep, unsteady slopes.", "The dam has also had a serious geological impact. Chinese officials and experts admitted at a forum in 2007 that the Three Gorges Dam had caused an array of ecological ills, including more frequent landslides, China's state news agency Xinhua reported at the time.", "\"The huge weight of the water behind the Three Gorges Dam had started to erode the Yangtze's banks in many places, which, together with frequent fluctuations in water levels, had triggered a series of landslides,\" the Xinhua report said, citing officials and experts at a meeting.", "The water in the reservoir saturates and erodes the base of the cliffs, and the fluctuation in water levels changes the weight of the reservoir and the pressure on the slopes, destabilizing the shoreline, geologists say", "Water gushes out for the first time through the Three Gorges Dam on June 11, 2003.

A few weeks later, on a tributary of the Three Gorges, a large chunk of a mountain split off and slipped into the river, killing 24 people, destroying 346 houses and capsizing over 20 boats.", "The dam, which sits near two major fault lines, has also been blamed for a surge in earthquakes in the region. Scientists argue that the weight of the large reservoir and the permeation of water into the rocks underneath can trigger earthquakes in regions already under considerable tectonic stress.", "According to a study from the China Earthquake Administration, in the six years after the reservoir was filled in June 2003, 3,429 earthquakes were recorded along the reservoir; only 94 earthquakes were recorded from January 2000 to May 2003.", "Another major concern is the blocking of sediments. By cutting the flow of the Yangtze River, the dam has retained huge amounts of silt, which not only dampens its flood control capacity by filling the reservoir, but also causes significant erosion downstream.", "days after the reservoir was filled for the first time in 2003, didn't help to alleviate concerns about the dam's safety.
