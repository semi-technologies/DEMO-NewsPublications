Over the past months, my headphones have given me respite from my lovely boyfriend\u2019s work calls and clanging family members in the kitchen (my workspace). Recently, I\u2019ve started taking end-of-day walks accompanied by my favorite, mood-boosting songs pumping through my ears. It\u2019s become an almost meditative evening ritual that provides a calming unwind needed after a busy workday.", "Because headphones are an essential not normally praised for their beauty, I was elated to see the playful fashion brand Collina Strada partner up with affordable headphone brand, Skullcandy. Headphones can carry a hefty price tag, and a beautiful pair at a reasonable price seems like a no-brainer. Beyond that, Hillary Teymour has designed Collina Strada not just as a fashion label, but as a platform for social issues and awareness. To Teymour, the partnership with Skullcandy seemed to be a natural fit. \u201cThey are committed to climate change with their work with Protect our Winters and are supporters of an eclectic mix of emerging musical artists.\u201d Teymour says of Skullcandy. \u201cTogether with Skullcandy I\u2019ve been able to infuse the unique Collina look into a rather utilitarian piece for an energized take on an everyday device.\u201d", "The collaboration features an over ear headphone and wireless earbuds, both in Collina\u2019s signature tie-dye. \u201cTie dye has been a core focal point in expressing my love of color, and bringing that to a new medium with my collaboration with Skullcandy was very exciting! I felt like a tie dye pattern was the perfect representation of music and soundwaves.\u201d Teymour tells Vogue.", "Ringing in at $80 for the wireless earbuds and $199 for the wireless over ear headphones, these thoughtfully crafted designer headphones feel like a steal. They will bring some joy into your daily routine, aesthetically and functionally. And you can\u2019t beat the cost-per-wear."], "authors": ["Rachel Besser", "Rachel Besse"], "keywords": ["ive", "designer", "collina", "headphones", "skullcandy", "steal", "strada", "wireless", "teymour", "bring", "work", "tie", "price", "joy", "feels", "day"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
