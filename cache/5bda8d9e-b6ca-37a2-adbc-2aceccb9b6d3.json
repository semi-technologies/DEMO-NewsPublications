But it is just as intense in the agricultural interior. That part of the country was never going to be friendly towards Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the Peronist president. He was elected a year ago, with Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a populist former president, as his running-mate. C\u00f3rdoba, the province where Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna is located (see map), voted strongly in favour of Mauricio Macri, the conservative incumbent who lost. The province, like most of the others along the route of this correspondent\u2019s road trip in September westwards from the capital, is bound to pose problems for Mr Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Front for All coalition in crucial mid-term elections due in October next year.", "He imposed one of the world\u2019s longest and strictest lockdowns. In addition to shutting borders and shops it impedes internal travel. To drive from Buenos Aires to the campo required permission from the central government. At a roadblock on the border between Santa Fe and C\u00f3rdoba, police demanded evidence of a negative covid-19 test taken within 48 hours.", "Such measures have not suppressed the disease. On October 19th Argentina recorded its millionth case. It is among the ten countries with the highest cumulative caseloads. In terms of deaths as a share of the population, it ranks just outside the top ten. Whereas early in the pandemic nine-tenths of new cases were in the capital, half are now in the interior. C\u00f3rdoba, Mendoza and Santa Fe, with a fifth of Argentina\u2019s 45m people, have reported more than a third of new cases in the past fortnight. The lockdown has weighed heavily on the economy. The IMF expects it to contract by 11.8% this year, compared with 8.1% for South America as a whole. Next year it is expected to grow by just 4.9%. Despite price controls, the inflation rate exceeds 36%. That is partly because the Central Bank is printing money to finance the budget deficit, which is forecast to be higher than 10% of GDP this year. More than half of children are below the official poverty line. \u201cThis is an economy imploding,\u201d says Federico Sturzenegger, a former president of the Central Bank. \u201cThe pandemic has become an excuse to avoid tough decisions.\u201d The toughest would be to devalue the peso, which would boost exports, including of the grains that grow in central Argentina, and preserve scarce foreign exchange. But it would drive inflation still higher. The government\u2019s policy is to control the currency\u2019s descent. It is officially valued at 78.3 to the dollar. On the black market the peso has slumped to 181. Rather than devalue to the level set by the market, in September the government introduced fresh currency controls to restrain demand for dollars. These have dismayed businesspeople and failed to stem the decline in the country\u2019s reserves. Economists believe the Central Bank\u2019s net liquid reserves are close to zero. To hold down domestic prices and fill its coffers, the government has levied punishing taxes on exporters. One landowner, whose family has grown soya, wheat and maize near Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna for generations, fumes at a 33% tax on farm exports. His goal is to survive the country\u2019s impending \u201cmeltdown\u201d. After this conversation the government temporarily reduced export taxes on soyabeans. That seems unlikely to improve the landowner\u2019s mood.", "According to a recent opinion poll conducted by Reale Dallatorre, 65% of people in C\u00f3rdoba and 54% in Santa Fe believe that the national government discriminates against them because they oppose the Peronists. In C\u00f3rdoba 40% of respondents said they favoured secession, a \u201cstunning\u201d finding, said the pollster. Nationally, the president\u2019s approval rating has dropped from the 80s at the start of the pandemic to 43% by late October.", "San Luis, west of C\u00f3rdoba, is friendlier towards the central government. Its governor, Alberto Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1, is a scion of a Peronist family. A brother was Argentina\u2019s president for a week during an economic crisis in 2001. San Luis\u2019s 508,000 people are accustomed to support from the federal government, especially when Peronists are in charge, which is most of the time. Yet just outside the capital city Marta, a young mother, sees little to like in its handling of the pandemic. The lockdown cost her her job at a clothes shop. \u201cOur president talks about protecting our jobs, our health, and putting food on the table,\u201d she says as she plays with her three children. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any of that.\u201d A police escort hurried visitors out of the province, \u201cto prevent you infecting us\u201d, said an officer.", "In wine-growing Mendoza, which requires visitors to present national- and provincial-government permits before entering, attitudes towards the government in Buenos Aires harden. There separatist sentiment has a spokesman in Alfredo Cornejo, a former governor who is now a congressman and leads the opposition Radical Party. In June he called for \u201cMendoexit\u201d. Mendoza, along with C\u00f3rdoba and Santa Fe, could be an \u201ceconomic engine-room\u201d, he says. (Currently they produce a fifth of Argentina\u2019s GDP .) But separation, Mr Cornejo admits, will not happen any time soon. Argentina\u2019s constitution outlaws it.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s advisers deny that Argentina\u2019s plight is as dire as people in the breadbasket believe it to be. \u201cCollapse? Out of the question,\u201d says one. The government is striving to boost confidence and attract investment in dollars. It is cutting or capping export taxes for minerals, oil and some industrial goods as well as farm products. It plans to renegotiate its $44bn debt to the IMF , a sequel to its deal on $65bn of debt owed to private bondholders. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has revived the idea of a \u201csocial pact\u201d with businesses, trade unions and civil-society groups to reduce inflation and make labour law less rigid.", "Reassurances from Buenos Aires mean little in the interior. In C\u00f3rdoba an old farmhand in a face-mask closes gates on a herd of Aberdeen Angus cows as a young trucker looks on, smoking a cigarette. \u201cDo we need a government to make the most of everything we have, as a country?\u201d the gaucho wonders. His sigh is the answer. The trucker nods. At one in their sense of alienation, they tap elbows.\u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["santa", "harvest", "drive", "pandemic", "aires", "central", "argentinas", "reveals", "grievance", "breadbasket", "president", "c\u00f3rdoba", "fe", "buenos", "capital"], "pubDate": "2020-10-29T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
