That was the case for one of this month\u2019s biggest messages, which we\u2019re calling \u201chaute bourgeois,\u201d or more colloquially the \u201cnew Celine effect.\u201d Hedi Slimane\u2019s Fall collection for the French house revisited its \u201970s heyday with pleated skirts, knee-high boots, and ladylike blouses, all of which became the uniform for many women this season. It\u2019s easy to see why; the look is simple, but not minimalist, and feels oddly refreshing after years of louder statements.", "On the complete other end of the spectrum were looks that captured the energy of fashion\u2019s new wave of designers, the upstart talents who are designing for the next decade\u2014and the next generation. Experimental doesn\u2019t feel like a strong enough word to describe what Eckhaus Latta, Telfar Clemens, and Vaquera are doing, though it\u2019s happening at the major houses, too, from Balenciaga to Gucci. It\u2019s a boundary-pushing, gender-bending, can\u2019t-quite-put-your-finger-on-it kind of cool, and we saw more of it on the streets than ever this season (and, more importantly, on people we\u2019ve never seen before).", "Those are just two extremes we saw outside the Spring 2020 shows in New York, London, Milan, and Paris, with other trends fitting somewhere in between, from shades of beige to electric neons and quite a lot of stylish guys, too. We\u2019ve distilled all 914 of Phil Oh\u2019s photos from the month down to the eight biggest trends, below.", "Advertisement 1 / 10", "Haute Topic", "Who would\u2019ve thought a pleated knee-length skirt would be the season\u2019s new must-have? We saw women in straight-off-the-runway Celine versions, as well as vintage skirts\u2014the point is you can\u2019t tell the difference\u2014often with tie-neck blouses, trim blazers, and knee-high boots. It\u2019s an elegant, straightforward pivot from the uber-styled, good-taste-meets-bad-taste vibes that dominated fashion for so long, and it makes getting dressed a breeze.", "Advertisement 1 / 21", "Shades of Beige", "An extension of the bourgeois trend, the Fall 2019 runways were awash in beige, taupe, and camel. The only way to wear it right now is head-to-toe, a trend we saw in the form of easy tailoring, jumpsuits, dresses, and the most classic beige item of all: the trench.", "Advertisement 1 / 17", "The Full Spectrum", "For those of us who\u2019d rather stay home than wear a camel blazer, bright colors were a retina-searing riposte. Typically we saw them on otherwise simple items, like Adut Akech\u2019s sweater and slip skirt, and they made an easy, bold statement mixed together: cobalt and emerald, lemon and fuchsia, teal and orange. Let these photos be your inspiration for the gray winter days ahead; nothing lifts the spirit like a neon-pink sweater.", "Advertisement 1 / 12", "Frou With Frisson", "Thanks to the influence of London designers Molly Goddard and Simone Rocha, a romantic, ruffled, exaggerated dress has evolved from a trend into a veritable wardrobe staple. For some women, like Vogue\u2019s Lynn Yaeger (pictured here with Goddard), it\u2019s something of a uniform. We saw women in expansive tulle tulle frocks by Goddard and voluminous, layered confections by Rocha, as well as simpler versions in black or white. What stands out is how women are wearing them: off-handedly, with boots or sneakers\u2014not five-inch stilettos.", "Advertisement 1 / 18", "The Next Gen", "It\u2019s tempting to call these looks \u201cpunk,\u201d but that would suggest a nod to the \u201970s and \u201980s, and this is something different. Sure, some of the details have been revived from that era\u2014studs, spikes, plaids, heavy boots\u2014but in a way that feels more futuristic than referential. Consider it a glimpse of how fashion will continue to evolve in the 2020s, fueled by forward-thinking designers like Eckhaus Latta, Telfar Clemens, Alessandro Michele, and Marine Serre.", "Advertisement 1 / 11", "Shorts Story", "Another trend that came from the Fall 2019 runways was shorts\u2014and we mean \u201creal\u201d shorts, not stretchy biker shorts. The best ones we saw on the streets were knee-length and generously cut, almost like culottes, and in rich materials like leather. These aren\u2019t just for casual Fridays: Women wore them to the month\u2019s biggest shows, like Valentino and Chanel.", "Advertisement 1 / 19", "We\u2019ve Got Male", "Just as the Spring 2020 Menswear shows had more women in the audience than ever before, we saw more guys than usual at this month\u2019s ready-to-wear shows. Or at least more stylish guys. Most of the men Oh photographed were dressing along the more experiential lines we mentioned earlier, like Yu Masui; others got into gender-bend-y territory, like Cody Fern; and some had looks all their own, including George Clinton and Casey Spooner.", "Advertisement 1 / 7", "Taking Up Space", "Despite the overarching return to simplicity in street style\u2014we saw a lot of button-downs and easy dresses\u2014there\u2019s always a desire for truly wild and surprising statements. This month it came in the form of twisted, oversized, and trompe l\u2019oeil silhouettes, like Michelle Elie\u2019s knotted Comme des Gar\u00e7ons look (we can always count on Elie!); Cardi B\u2019s bulbous Thom Browne suit; and Masui\u2019s Doublet coat with shoulders so exaggerated, they completely obscured his face. From behind, the effect was startling, like he was actually headless.
