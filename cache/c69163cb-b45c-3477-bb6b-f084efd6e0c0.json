Twelve different versions have been released since the game was introduced in 2007, each of them more or less clinging to the same highly enjoyable formula. Like history? Like climbing things? Like stabbing people in the skull? Like being intermittently scowled at by Danny Wallace? Like spending the final hour of any pursuit genuinely confused about why an alien has come out of nowhere to instruct you to murder everyone with a sort of glowing death apple? Then Assassin\u2019s Creed is for you.", "So the news that Netflix has just commissioned a live-action Assassin\u2019s Creed series should be cause for celebration. After all, one of its biggest hits of last year was The Witcher \u2013 a series that was based on a game that was based on a book \u2013 which shows that there\u2019s plenty of demand for this sort of thing. If done well, the Assassin\u2019s Creed series could be relentlessly entertaining. It could be \u2013 and this is not a phrase I use lightly \u2013 Game of Thrones with parkour. Isn\u2019t that everything you ever wanted?", "However, one thing stands in the way of Assassin\u2019s Creed being fun, and that\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed. Because someone already tried to make a live-action Assassin\u2019s Creed, and the fact that you have already forgotten about it speaks volumes. It was a movie, released in 2016. Michael Fassbender was the star and producer. And it was terrible. Truly, inexplicably, bone-destroyingly terrible.", "Structurally it was a mess, opening with three different \u2013 yet equally boring \u2013 slabs of exposition before anything happened. It appeared to end, two and a half hours later, at the climax of act two. It was painfully lumpen and self-serious. Critics hated it. Audiences stayed away in their droves. The Hollywood Reporter estimated that it lost its studio $100m. Two sequels were planned, but soon ditched. Fassbender has subsequently been quite open about the film\u2019s failures, but nevertheless it was so bad that anyone stupid enough to pay to watch it (hi!) will always be cagey about any further adaptations.", "But you know what? Call me an optimist, but I think I can see a way for the Assassin\u2019s Creed series to work. In retrospect, the movie acts as a kind of government information film about everything that can go wrong with an Assassin\u2019s Creed adaptation. If the series learns from its mistakes, it might have something great on its hands.", "First, and most importantly, it needs to dramatically pare back its premise. Even the Assassin\u2019s Creed games suffer from too much of it. You play a modern-day explorer who gets put into a machine by a sinister big tech company in order to relive the memories of a distant ancestor. Nobody actually likes these bits. The fun part is being sent back in time to run around beautiful reconstructions of ancient Rome or Victorian London or civil war-era America. That is all anyone wants from a series. Nothing set today. No laboured interludes about a guy in a hopped-up MRI machine. Just give us a good solid period story where the lead character inevitably ends up having to fist fight the Pope and we will all be thrilled.", "The other issue is tone. Nobody plays the Assassin\u2019s Creed games to be immersed in its tortured mythology. They play it because it\u2019s fun to run around slitting throats and swan-dive off cathedrals. The film was far too infatuated with all the wrong things; the history of the assassins, the moral weight that comes with each death. If the lead character is charming and self-aware \u2013 basically if he\u2019s Ezio from the second game \u2013 then it will go a long way to correcting the mistakes of the movie.", "Then, and only then, will we finally have the thing we have all dreamed of.
