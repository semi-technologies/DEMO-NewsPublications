Donald Trump was running a re-election campaign founded in lies, and I had no faith that my fellow Americans would throw him out. The polls were reassuring, but I wasn\u2019t reassured. Polls were reassuring in 2016, too, and this country still ended up in an abusive relationship with the most corrupt and dangerous president of my lifetime.", "I had no faith, but I held out hope. The ubiquity of the anti-Trump ads created by The Lincoln Project, a group of Republican operatives endorsing Joe Biden, gave me hope. A change of heart in so many of my conservative friends \u2014 disgusted by Mr. Trump\u2019s greed and deception and boorish behavior, disgusted by his inexplicable subservience to foreign despots, his encouragement of outrageous conspiracy theories, his loyalty to his own interests and no one else\u2019s \u2014 gave me hope. Above all, the massive registration and get-out-the-vote effort in Black communities across the country gave me hope. Change was in the air \u2014 I could feel it. An uprising was upon us. A great repudiation was at hand.", "A plan for containing the pandemic was finally coming. A serious reckoning with climate change, a fair approach to immigration, criminal justice reform, a strong health care safety net, a renewed emphasis on voting rights \u2014 all suddenly possible.", "On election night I was quadruple-screening the coverage \u2014 The Times on my laptop, PBS on our television, Twitter on my iPad, half a dozen text threads going with friends on my phone \u2014 and the news kept getting grimmer and grimmer. \u201cThis is exactly the way I felt four years ago,\u201d my brother texted as early results came in."], "authors": ["Margaret Renkl"], "keywords": ["nation", "painfully", "disgusted", "friends", "gave", "election", "hope", "reassuring", "opinion", "divided", "grimmer", "faith", "polls", "change"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
