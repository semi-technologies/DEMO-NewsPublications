Big companies and wealthy investors seem to have landed in a sweet spot with the election outcome. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times For Wall Street, the 2020 election was fraught with risk and uncertainty. Early on, candidates who promised to rein in the excesses of corporate America and tax the superrich, as part of their pledges to close the country\u2019s wealth gap, were in contention to be the Democratic nominee for president. More recently, the concern shifted to the potential for civil unrest, or an election with no clear outcome, both factors that would result in the kind of uncertain environment that investors and chief executives both loathe. In the end, though, big companies and wealthy investors seem to have landed in a sweet spot: a more predictable White House under Joseph R. Biden Jr., now the president-elect, paired with a Republican-led Senate that can ward off higher taxes or other policy changes investors find unappealing. (At least for now, that is. Control of the Senate is a matter that won\u2019t be settled until January after Georgia holds two runoff elections.) \u201cFinancial markets don\u2019t want risk or sudden changes,\u201d said Charles Phillips, a longtime software executive who is raising a technology-investment fund and a supporter of Mr. Biden. \u201cSo the fact that he\u2019s levelheaded and collaborative, and the fact that most likely we may have a Republican Senate \u2014 if that happens, it\u2019ll limit what he can do,\u201d he said. Markets bolted upward last week as the national vote count appeared to point to that result. Over the weekend, after the race was called for Mr. Biden, some analysts said to expect more gains over the peaceful completion of the voting process, and to watch for an uptick in shares of companies Mr. Biden\u2019s policy agenda is likely to benefit \u2014 including green-energy companies, producers of virus-testing materials and laboratories, and those in the infrastructure space. Mr. Biden did win substantial financial backing from finance-industry donors, (about $74 million, according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, which overshadowed Mr. Trump\u2019s support from those donors by a factor of four to one), and some expressed their excitement for their candidate. \u201cPresident-elect Biden offers enormous experience, a steady hand and an unparalleled ability to overcome obstacles,\u201d said Jon Gray, the president of the giant investment firm Blackstone Group. Other reactions from across Wall Street after the election was called were more measured. Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel, said he was \u201crelieved there is no social unrest,\u201d David Solomon, the C.E.O of Goldman Sachs, and George Wallace, who runs Neuberger Berman, both pointed to the challenges Mr. Biden faces with the country in a pandemic and an economic crisis. Bill Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, meanwhile, called on President Trump to \u201cconcede graciously and call for unity from all who have supported you.\u201d \u2014", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "SoftBank continues its recovery as tech shares soar. Outside a Softbank shop in Tokyo on Monday. The technology conglomerate\u2019s latest earnings report showed that the company is still improving from a big loss a year ago. Credit... Koji Sasahara/Associated Press Over the past year, SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate headed by maverick billionaire Masayoshi Son, has come back from the brink of disaster. SoftBank said on Monday that the trend had continued through the end of the summer, extending a recovery that followed one of the worst losses in Japan\u2019s corporate history. The company on Monday reported 562 billion yen, or $5.4 billion, in profit for the three months that ended in September. The jump from a big loss a year ago was largely driven by broad growth in global tech stocks as the coronavirus pushes consumers to spend more of their lives online. Last year, a disastrous investment in the office space company WeWork cast doubt on Mr. Son\u2019s investment strategy. Earlier this year, the coronavirus pandemic cratered Softbank\u2019s high-profile bets on companies like Uber and Oyo, which were hit hard by lockdowns across the world. But a broad market recovery has pushed up the value of some stocks held by Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, the world\u2019s largest tech investment vehicle. The company said the fund\u2019s original investment of $75 billion in 83 companies had grown to $76.4 billion by the end of September. Around half of the fund\u2019s growth, however, came from increased valuations in its unlisted companies. SoftBank has frequently come under criticism by analysts for a lack of transparency in how it values its investments in the these privately held companies. The market volatility was not all good news for SoftBank. The company also recorded $1.27 billion in losses from risky bets on derivatives. The moves, which were widely reported in September, have raised additional concerns about Mr. Son\u2019s investment acumen. In an earnings conference Monday evening, Mr. Son brushed off criticism about his management, dismissing the losses as short-term setbacks that distracted from his long-term vision for the company\u2019s success. \u2014"], "authors": ["Eshe Nelson", "Kate Kelly", "Jason Karaian", "Ben Dooley"], "keywords": ["mr", "vaccine", "coronavirus", "higher", "investment", "senate", "updates", "election", "investors", "companies", "jump", "live", "pfizers", "markets", "biden"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
