I still haven't even done all the things I want to do...I'm really into textures, especially just working in fashion, playing with fabrics all the time. Jelly just seemed like a cool substance to start with.\u201d", "Those textures have resulted in endless regrams, and captured the attention of brands. Park was recently commissioned to make cakes for Nike, as well as the shaving company Billie, and has more top secret fashion collaborations coming before the end of the year. She also just launched her first dessert available at a restaurant. The aforementioned violet-blue corn on the cob is made of almond jelly sitting in a chicha morada syrup, a popular Peruvian beverage made from purple corn. It will be available at Opening Ceremony Founder Humberto Leon\u2019s new restaurant, Chifa.", "Jelly corn for Chifa. Photo: Courtesy of N\u00fcnchi", "The Chifa collaboration was inspired by her first jelly corns, which she makes in a cheerful yellow. \u201cKoreans are really obsessed with corn. It's a cultural thing,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI found a mold and I was like, \u2018oh my God, I have to make it.\u2019 I try to tie everything back to my culture.\u201d", "Park, who started N\u00fcnchi in July 2019, now makes about 200 cakes a month in her home kitchen, supplying both a la carte and custom orders. Each one is completely different, based on what Park has available and her inspiration. She sources local and fresh ingredients from her farmer\u2019s market in Santa Monica or Hollywood. \u201cSome people want the same thing, over and over again,\u201d she explains. \u201cI try to tell them, I don't really want to be making the same cakes over and over again. But what\u2019s cool is they'll tell me, it\u2019s for this person and here's their Instagram, and that will kind of spawn something and I'll kind of go off of that. I like making each cake pretty personal for who's eating it.\u201d", "When she\u2019s not baking cakes, Park is working on expanding the N\u00fcnchi brand, launching her own home goods collection and merch in the next month or so. She\u2019ll be selling aprons, lazy susans and more. She\u2019s also working hard to have her cakes available beyond the west coast, and hopes to be able to ship from New York in the near future. Her main mission? \u201cI want to integrate fashion and food continuously.\u201d"], "authors": ["Kristen Bateman", "Kristen Batema"], "keywords": ["available", "making", "favorite", "try", "park", "cakes", "integrating", "working", "jelly", "las", "food", "fashion", "really", "creator", "corn"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
