The Mass Effect trilogy, which ended in March 2012 (but never in our hearts), continues to be a reigning staple in the RPG world. With Commander Shepard \u2013 the undeniably strong hero facing tremendous odds, companions that burrow their way into your heart, and a storyline that is as epic as the characters brought into it \u2013 BioWare gave a true gift with this epic franchise.

Sad that Joker's Seth Green won't be in attendance, nor my beloved Garrus Vakarian, but this reunion will be one for the books as we celebrate the universe and the epic tale of conquering the Reapers.", "N7 Day is a day of celebration. Some years it has just been a community spotlight with art and cool sales on gear, while other years have been rife with announcements and special reveals. We know that BioWare will be revisiting the Mass Effect universe once Dragon Age 4 is further along, but maybe, just maybe, we'll finally get that trilogy confirmation we've been lusting after.", "Any special plans for celebrating N7 Day, Mass Effect fans?
