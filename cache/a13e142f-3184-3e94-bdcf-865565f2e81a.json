All of these things are inspiring\u2014and scent is a part of that process.\u201d", "These varied influences have helped earn Aldridge 5.2 million followers on Instagram\u2014just the sort of loyalty that made her an obvious first choice for IMG as it bids to become a major player in the beauty industry by tapping into its considerable talent pool (the agency also reps Ashley Graham, Halima Aden, and both Bella and Gigi Hadid).", "It\u2019s not all algorithms and analytics, though. Aldridge\u2019s passion for perfume is apparent the second you get her going on top notes and base notes. \u201cI wanted to create something that I hadn\u2019t smelled before,\u201d she says of her efforts to avoid \u201cthat artificial floral\u201d quality you smell in similar scent profiles.
