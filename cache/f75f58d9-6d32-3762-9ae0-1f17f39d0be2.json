The game's ending hinted at a sequel, and Sports Story may be it, just with a wider focus than we expected. Slated to release in mid-2020 exclusively for Switch, Sidebar Games' Sports Story sets players on another adventure with a focus on golf, but you'll also be tasked to pick up a racket to play some tennis, kick a soccer ball, swing a baseball bat, and more.", "Nintendo's press release also states that the game will feature dungeons and espionage, which may sound odd, but are exactly what I want and expect from this series. In my review, in which I gave the game a 9 out of 10, I said \"Golf Story makes you care about the characters and their world just as much as sinking a do-or-die putt. Part of its charm is keeping you off kilter, forcing you to hit a 300-yard drive with pinpoint precision one second, then solve a murder mystery the next.\" If you haven't played it yet, you are missing out on a fantastic RPG experience."], "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47", "authors": ["Executive Editor", "Weekly Trips To Arcades To Owning Every System That Hit The Market Since The Atari", "Andrew Has Dedicated His Life To Video Games."], "title": "The Creators Of Golf Story Are Back With Sports Story", "id": "f75f58d9-6d32-3762-9ae0-1f17f39d0be2", "keywords": ["game", "rpg", "release", "youll", "world", "creators", "switch", "games", "focus", "wider", "golf"], "summary": "To this day, I believe Golf Story is one of the best games on Switch.\nThe blending of old-school RPG storytelling and skill-based golf is charming, fun, and different in a good way.\nThe game's ending hinted at a sequel, and Sports Story may be it, just with a wider focus than we expected.\nIn my review, in which I gave the game a 9 out of 10, I said \"Golf Story makes you care about the characters and their world just as much as sinking a do-or-die putt.\nIf you haven't played it yet, you are missing out on a fantastic RPG experience.", "pubDate": null, "url": "https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2019/12/10/the-creators-of-golf-story-are-back-with-sports-story"}
