Aiming for a young audience, the former President appeared this week on the Snapchat show \u201cGood Luck America,\u201d the host of which, Peter Hamby, asked whether the Democratic Party still had a \u201cpro-capitalist\u201d case to offer young voters. \u201cSocialism is cool. Bernie, A.O.C., they\u2019re cool. The Democratic Party isn\u2019t really cool,\u201d Hamby said.", "None of this confident allocation of cool surprised Obama, who nodded\u2014and who, incidentally, still looked cool himself, wearing a dark suit and tieless blue-striped shirt, his hair now on the white side of gray. He said he thought that the Democrats should have given Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a much more prominent role at the national convention this past summer. But, if he wanted Ocasio-Cortez to talk more, he didn\u2019t think that the Party should talk more like her. \u201cSocialism is still a loaded term for a lot of folks,\u201d Obama told Hamby. When it came to the call to defund the police, \u201cI guess you can use a snappy slogan like \u2018defund the police,\u2019 but you know you\u2019ve lost a big audience the minute you say it.\u201d Obama added, \u201cThe key is deciding do you want to actually get something done? Or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?\u201d", "Right now, the most important arguments within the Democratic Party are taking place mostly out of public view, in the maneuverings to place staffers in the Joe Biden Administration\u2014and, in so doing, to shape its ambitions. But, in the month since the election, a parallel argument has taken place in public between the Party\u2019s most progressive elected officials and its moderates, who believe that the progressives\u2019 embrace of activist slogans\u2014particularly the call to defund the police\u2014cost the Democrats seats in 2020 and might eventually cost them their House majority. The progressive faction is poor in numbers but rich in ideas and public profile, and the 2020 election neither strengthened their position within the Party nor wiped them out. The dispute over whether the progressives are too radical in their talk has settled into a stalemate, especially because there is no consensus on what \u201cdefund the police\u201d means; Obama\u2019s entry into the debate, characteristically caveated, didn\u2019t break the impasse. But Obama and Ocasio-Cortez are the two politicians who in this century have managed to embody the qualities essential to the Democratic Party: youth and idealism, hope and change, the promise of a future different than the past. In elevating Ocasio-Cortez and gently criticizing her ideas, Obama opened up a different conversation\u2014not just about the left and the center but about how a star politician ought to be, between one generational talent and another.", "During the tumultuous past half decade\u2014as conservatives contemplated authoritarianism, as Democrats reconsidered socialism, as liberalism generally faltered\u2014Obama spent much of his time writing a book. Unlike his previous two books, his new memoir, \u201cA Promised Land,\u201d is mostly about the mature Obama (he is inaugurated as President a third of the way in) and about the evolution of the character who appeared on Peter Hamby\u2019s Snapchat show, with his caution and good humor. The book\u2019s first sections are the most interesting in terms of Obama\u2019s account of his own character: a central theme is the tension that the future President felt, when he was around thirty, between \u201cwanting to be in politics and not of it.\u201d On an early date with Michelle, which takes place at an organizing workshop Obama is leading, she tells him that he is talking about a place between \u201cthe world as it is and the world as it should be.\u201d", "In Obama\u2019s account, he had been snapped out of a self-serious post-undergraduate mode\u2014lost in the abstraction of \u201cthe world as it should be\u201d\u2014by his encounters with working-class people on the South Side of Chicago, during his pre-law-school stint as an organizer. \u201cI came to love the men and women I worked with: the single mom living on a ravaged block who somehow got all four children through college; the Irish priest who threw open the church doors every evening so that kids had an option other than gangs; the laid-off steelworker who went back to school to become a social worker,\u201d he writes. \u201cTheir stories of hardship and their modest victories confirmed for me again and again the basic decency of people.\u201d Chicago brings him out of his own head: \u201cIn other words, I grew up, and I got my sense of humor back.\u201d Reading this passage, I doubted it a bit. Those characters are flat. They read as grist for stump speeches. They are rendered more than they are seen.", "The people he does obviously love in this book, whom he takes the time to see in full, are the political professionals who work mostly for him. When he is feeling grouchy on the Presidential campaign trail in 2008, his spirits are restored by his body man, Reggie Love, who says that he\u2019s \u201chaving the time of my life.\u201d Obama admires his gruff, heavyset, flannel-clad Iowa field director, Paul Tewes, who has \u201cthe heart of the ten year old boy who cared enough, who believed enough, to cry over an election.\u201d A couple of days before Osama bin Laden\u2019s killing, he observes his devoted national-security adviser, Tom Donilon (a man who just returned to BlackRock rather than take a job as Biden\u2019s C.I.A. director). Donilon, Obama writes, had \u201cbeen trying to exercise more and lay off the caffeine but was apparently losing the battle. I\u2019d come to marvel at Tom\u2019s capacity for hard work, the myriad details he kept track of, the volume of memos and cables and data he had to consume, the number of snafus he fixed and the interagency tussles he resolved, all so that I could have both the information and the mental space I needed in order to my job.\u201d The White House becomes an image of the country he\u2019d like to see. Most people are not out for themselves. Everyone works so hard.", "He loves them, and they love him back. When Obama decided to run for President, he had been in Washington for two years, almost exactly as long as Ocasio-Cortez has been there now. Nonetheless, in Obama\u2019s account, he had the tacit support of many of the Party\u2019s elders. He spoke to Harry Reid, who told him a story about a young boxer and said he should go for it: \u201cYou get people motivated, especially young people, minorities, even middle-of-the-road people. That\u2019s different.\u201d Obama also paid a visit to Ted Kennedy. (He recalls the avuncular senator rising \u201cgingerly\u201d from his seat.) Kennedy told Obama that he couldn\u2019t endorse him early\u2014\u201ctoo many friends\u201d\u2014 but, recalling his brothers, encouraged the younger senator to run nevertheless: \u201cThe power to inspire is rare. Moments like this are rare.\u201d Once in office, whenever Obama feels stuck, he notices the ambition, dedication, and hope in the people around him, and becomes determined again. In Obama\u2019s telling, external pressures\u2014the Republicans, the press\u2014always nudge him toward loneliness. The salve\u2014in many ways, the theme of his story\u2014is comradeship.", "Who are Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comrades? If any leading senators are taking her aside to tell her that she represents the future of the Party, no one\u2019s given any public hint of it. Among Democrats, she often seems nearly alone. The Squad, composed of Ocasio-Cortez and Representatives Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib, project a sense of solidarity, but there are still just four of them. Trace Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s public statements since her election and she makes her distance from the mainstream Democratic Party plain. When David Remnick asked Ocasio-Cortez, in 2019, whether she had a relationship with Nancy Pelosi, Ocasio-Cortez replied, \u201cNot particularly.\u201d When New York magazine\u2019s David Freedlander asked her earlier this year what she made of Joe Biden, Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cIn any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party.\u201d There is a history of slights and incursions on both sides. In November, 2018, just after Ocasio-Cortez won, she participated in a sit-in of Pelosi\u2019s office by the young climate activists of the Sunrise Movement; a month later, Politico reported that she had recruited a challenger to Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the fifth-ranking Democrat in the House. As for Pelosi, at that time, she made a habit of dismissing the dreams of young progressives, referring to \u201ctheir public whatever,\u201d \u201cthe green dream or whatever they call it.\u201d Last month, Ocasio-Cortez told the Times\u2019 Astead Herndon that, during the first six months of her term, she was unsure whether she would even run for re\u00eblection. \u201cIt\u2019s the stress. It\u2019s the violence,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m serious when I tell people the odds of me running for higher office and the odds of me just going off trying to start a homestead somewhere\u2014they\u2019re probably the same.\u201d", "The dispute between the moderates and progressives went on a long hiatus during the Presidential campaign, but the weeks since the election have made clear that it isn\u2019t a matter of the past. On a House Democratic Caucus call in November, Representative Abigail Spanberger, a former C.I.A. analyst who was narrowly re\u00eblected in a suburban Virginia district that voted for Trump in 2016, asked her colleagues to watch reels of attack ads run against moderate Democrats, to see the political consequences of allying with activists. In audio that leaked to the Washington Post, Spanberger said, \u201cThe No. 1 concern and thing that people brought to me in my district that I barely re-won was defunding the police. And I\u2019ve heard from colleagues who have said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the language of the street\u2014we should respect that.\u2019 We\u2019re in Congress. We are professionals. We are supposed to talk about things in the way where we mean what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s response was that the Democrats\u2019 failures were not ideological but tactical; she blamed a lack of digital-ad spending and the Party\u2019s abandonment of door-knocking during the coronavirus pandemic. But the details of the argument appeared less important than how eager both sides seemed to be to engage in it again. A few days later, four progressive groups\u2014New Deal Strategies, the Sunrise Movement, the Justice Democrats, and Data for Progress\u2014produced a memo supporting Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s contentions. These have been Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comrades: not the Democrats but the activists.", "A paradox of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s position is that her skills are not activist skills but mainstream ones. She delivers highly polished speeches. She finds connections between niche political news and the lives of working people. She can conjure a news cycle out of thin air\u2014and then win it. An early risk in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Washington career was that she would be seen strictly as an ing\u00e9nue, but she turned her committee hearings into platforms to showcase her careful study of policy and incisive questioning. It isn\u2019t news to her allies that her base is not big enough, and in the past two years they have taken steps to build it\u2014to broaden her appeal without moderating her. In July, after Representative Ted Yoho, a Republican of Florida, called her a \u201cfucking bitch\u201d in earshot of reporters, Ocasio-Cortez delivered a remarkable speech expressing frustration on behalf of all women, because \u201call of us have had to deal with this in some form, some way, some shape, at some point in our lives.\u201d Not long after, Ocasio-Cortez sat for a long cover interview with Vanity Fair, which focussed on her upbringing, her personal life, and the daily indignities that a working person must endure.", "The line of scrimmage between progressives and the established Democratic Party has not moved much since Bernie Sanders\u2019s first Presidential campaign, five years ago. For all the talk of generational revolution, the Party is run by more or less exactly the same people. What has changed is that the Democratic establishment has embraced policy changes that it would have shunned a decade ago. Having won the primary as the most moderate figure onstage, Biden adopted a much more progressive agenda in the general election. Biden\u2019s platform proposes raising three trillion dollars in revenue during the next ten years, almost entirely by taxing the wealthy and corporations. He plans to spend two trillion dollars on climate transformation during his first term, forty per cent of it targeted to help disadvantaged communities. Like nearly all Democrats, Biden now supports a fifteen-dollar-per-hour minimum wage, a key part of Sanders\u2019s platform in 2016, and like much of the Party he supports a public option for health insurance. There isn\u2019t such an obvious place for Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic effort right now; it is trying to persuade voters that an expansive agenda is actually pragmatic and common sense, while she is trying to emphasize what is revolutionary.", "What were Obama\u2019s and Spanberger\u2019s arguments with Ocasio-Cortez about, anyway? Mostly, language. Neither has emphasized policy differences with the progressives; they were talking about talk. In their interview, Obama told Hamby that Ocasio-Cortez and Biden shared a desire for broad action on climate change, and implied that they were divided only by how to talk about it: \u201cIf you want to move people, they are moved by stories that connect with their own lives. They\u2019re not moved by ideology.\u201d This tendency to police language is part of what has always grated on the left about Obama. But it is also a sign of a winning hand. The paradox of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s position right now is that she isn\u2019t isolated politically because she is losing. She is isolated politically because, on more substantive matters than it is in anyone\u2019s interest to admit, she has already won."], "authors": ["Benjamin Wallace-Wells", "Benjamin Wallace-Well", "Steve Col"], "keywords": ["democratic", "distinct", "democrats", "barack", "talk", "progressives", "obama", "political", "paths", "public", "young", "ocasiocortezs", "party", "alexandria", "ocasiocortez"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
