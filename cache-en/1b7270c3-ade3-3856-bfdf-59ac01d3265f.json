One such example is that of the Universal Windows Platform. It looks like the above channel used RetroArch to work with the UWP, a known emulation software that retro fans love to use.", "The above video showcases games like Metal Gear Solid 2, Ico, and Jax & Dexter running on the Xbox Series S, though the performance isn't flawless, which was to be expected.", "What do you think about the PS2 emulator playing on the Xbox Series S?
