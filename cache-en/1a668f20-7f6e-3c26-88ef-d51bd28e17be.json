The comedy of this ritual\u2014disparate characters flung together day after day, attempting to accomplish grand or humble things without killing one another\u2014has fuelled countless workplace sitcoms, from \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d to \u201c30 Rock.\u201d But \u201cThe Office,\u201d the American faux-documentary series that ran from 2005 to 2013, and which arose from the sour, drab-looking, painfully funny British sitcom of the same name, came to be one of our most prominent depictions of office life, because it seemed to show us the truth in the tedium. As Jim (John Krasinski), the show\u2019s Everyman character, who finds love with Pam (Jenna Fischer), the receptionist, says, \u201cEverything I have I owe to this job\u2014this stupid, wonderful, boring, amazing job.\u201d", "Is the office good for us? The answer to that question changes during the long trajectory of the series. The British \u201cOffice,\u201d created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, which began in 2001 and comprises fourteen episodes, was inspired in part by a reality-TV trend popular in the U.K. at the time, depicting regular people doing regular things, such as attending driving school. It was set at a middling place in a middling town: a branch of the Wernham Hogg paper company, in Slough. The boss, David Brent (Gervais), was a jokey, goateed nightmare wrapped in neediness and a necktie (\u201cI\u2019m a friend first and a boss second, probably an entertainer third\u201d), and everybody else, his captive audience, was vaguely depressed and numb, getting by on paychecks, crushes, and pranks. The actors looked and acted like everyday people\u2014almost startlingly so. Yet the show\u2019s bleak world quickly became addictive, and its brief opening sequence\u2014sweeping instrumental theme, mid-rise office buildings, cars swirling through a roundabout\u2014can still provoke an aching wistfulness, for Wernham Hogg and, somehow, for the day-to-day life you\u2019re actually living.", "The American adaptation, created by Greg Daniels (\u201cKing of the Hill\u201d) with Gervais and Merchant, supersized all this\u2014some two hundred episodes, extensive world-building, more romance\u2014and placed its middling paper company, Dunder Mifflin, in working-class Scranton, Pennsylvania. Viewer wistfulness has only increased with time. Though it ended seven years ago, the American \u201cOffice\u201d competes, even now, to be the most-watched show on Netflix. More than forty-six billion minutes of it were streamed in 2018. The teen pop star Billie Eilish, whose song \u201cMy Strange Addiction\u201d samples \u201cOffice\u201d dialogue, has seen the entire series fourteen times. And this year two of the most popular podcasts on iTunes and Spotify were \u201cOffice\u201d podcasts, hosted by former cast members.", "Both podcasts accept the show\u2019s genius and significance as a given. \u201cAn Oral History of \u2018The Office,\u2019 \u201d a limited series with Brian Baumgartner, who played Kevin the accountant, aims to find out \u201chow a group of unknowns overcame the odds and changed the face of television,\u201d and recently concluded on Spotify; \u201cOffice Ladies,\u201d \u201cthe ultimate \u2018Office\u2019 rewatch podcast,\u201d hosted by Angela Kinsey (Angela) and Jenna Fischer, discusses each episode in order, and may go on forever. \u201cWe were on \u2018The Office\u2019 together!\u201d Fischer says in the intro. Kinsey adds, \u201cAnd\u2014we\u2019re best friends!\u201d It\u2019s a chipper gabfest. Fischer begins episodes with \u201cFast Facts\u201d; Kinsey, who enjoys using \u201cshiitake\u201d as a swear, describes details she observes upon rewatching, such as Kelly Kapoor\u2019s updo. The insight to be found is roughly proportional to the amount of work that gets done at Dunder Mifflin: enough, but it\u2019s not really the point.", "Baumgartner\u2019s show is almost as giddy\u2014the word \u201cbrilliant\u201d is thrown around generously\u2014but it accomplishes the useful service of making the familiar unfamiliar again. It can be easy to forget how strange the American \u201cOffice\u201d was on prime-time television in 2005\u2014and how unlikely it was to succeed. \u201cO.K., here\u2019s the pitch,\u201d the executive producer, Ben Silverman, says, laughing, in Baumgartner\u2019s first episode. \u201cUnlikable lead, single camera, no one really attractive in a traditional television sense. Super awkward and slow, no laugh track, and a faux documentary.\u201d The format was not only technically challenging\u2014and unappealing to network execs\u2014but hard for American audiences to comprehend; it wasn\u2019t yet a sitcom trope in the U.S., and reality TV itself had yet to boom. The setting was mundane. And the creators wanted actors who were realistic-looking, just like the British cast.", "For this last task, they hired Allison Jones, the casting savant who discovered Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, and others for \u201cFreaks and Geeks.\u201d \u201cI always like to cast non-star people,\u201d Jones tells Baumgartner. \u201cI think it pays off most in the end.\u201d She also liked nerds, and believed that audiences would empathize with their fears and insecurities. On Baumgartner\u2019s podcast, Fischer recalls that, before her audition, Jones gave her some advice: \u201cDare to bore me.\u201d The characters\u2019 bold boringness, their willingness to talk in passive, everyday cadences, was a great part of the show\u2019s v\u00e9rit\u00e9 thrill. Some cast members, such as Jones\u2019s longtime casting associate, Phyllis Smith, were nonactors; others, including Mindy Kaling and B. J. Novak, were writer-performers. Rainn Wilson, as Dwight, brought a weird power-geek bluster we hadn\u2019t seen on sitcoms before. And the middle-aged actors had a refreshingly low-key, over-it energy. \u201cThis here is a run-out-the-clock situation,\u201d the sales rep Stanley (Leslie David Baker) says, with dead-eyed seriousness, to a peer who wants to speed up a project in the warehouse. \u201cJust like upstairs.\u201d The actors were filmed \u201cworking\u201d at their desks every morning for a week; a resulting shot of Fischer, who had actually worked as a receptionist, using Wite-Out was added to the show\u2019s opening sequence. Watching these \u201cordinary-looking losers,\u201d as Baumgartner describes them, was different in almost every way from watching \u201cFrasier\u201d or \u201cFriends.\u201d", "Where the adaptation deviated from the original, and from realism, was in its tone. The original was a satire, skewering the deadening compromise of office life and celebrating the small human pleasures one might eke out within it. The adaptation was a comfort, portraying the office as a friendly, if bonkers, home. While it teased the lonely boss character, Michael Scott (Steve Carell), for needing his co-workers too much\u2014\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this says \u2018WORLD\u2019S BEST DAD,\u2019 \u201d he tells the camera in Season 3, holding up a \u201cWORLD\u2019S BEST BOSS\u201d mug, which he bought himself\u2014it also rejoiced in its amiable world of cubicles, party planning, and passive-aggressive pranks. In Baumgartner\u2019s series, we learn that many children watch \u201cThe Office\u201d\u2014its rhythm and predictability have a soothing effect, with the familiarity of a classroom\u2014and that fans of all ages keep it humming along in the background, letting its dozens of hours companionably unspool. For adults, even before lockdown, the solidity of the \u201cOffice\u201d work environment, the 401(k)-style atmosphere, could represent a fantasy in itself.", "But it didn\u2019t start out as a celebration. Gervais had worked in an office for ten years, and, in his telling, he\u2019d been inspired by \u201cyour first boss, who was an idiot.\u201d Guys like David Brent played along with political correctness: they \u201cknew they couldn\u2019t be sexist upstairs, because they\u2019d get in trouble with H.R.,\u201d but they also \u201cwanted to be a lad downstairs, where the warehouse is.\u201d Daniels kept this idea, while aiming to give the American \u201cOffice\u201d \u201cten per cent more hope,\u201d he said. That ended up being a low estimate. In casting Michael Scott, Jones chose Carell, whose \u201csweet and simple\u201d Michael is not a pitiable sad sack but a handsome, lighthearted buffoon, who was \u201cas asleep in a woke world as it was possible to be,\u201d Carell tells Baumgartner. Many of his foolish remarks are sexist or racist or loudly ignorant (\u201cKelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer-service rep\u201d), but he cares about the underlings whose approval he craves, and his core, unflagging sweetness makes him lovable. Much of both shows\u2019 charm involves people bonding as they deal with the idiot boss; the sparky fun of Jim and Pam\u2019s relationship, and the pleasure in our relationship to them, comes from their shared jokes and glances, moments of fellow-feeling amid the mayhem. The realistic aesthetic only heightens that pleasure.", "And yet, as the show progressed, it could seem to want to have it both ways: to get credit for being P.C. and to be a lad downstairs; to be appreciated for aesthetic daring and to be an overbroad mainstream sitcom. In making Michael a beloved member of the gang, the creators intensified the Archie Bunker problem: Michael\u2019s na\u00efve bigotry, which quickly devolved into unfunny clowning, can be laughed at, laughed with, or wearily endured, and is as much a rhythm of the show as the sound of paper falling into copier trays. In later seasons, the series\u2019 affectations of realism all but disappeared\u2014characters became caricatures, plots got loopy and desperate, stars like James Spader were shoehorned in, several episodes were set in Florida\u2014but the idea that the show is realistic persists, and the fandom continues to grow. The keepers of its legacy, as heard on these podcasts, are simply here to bask in its greatness. On Baumgartner\u2019s show, we\u2019re told that a mantra for the writers was \u201ctruth and beauty,\u201d an idea echoed in the series\u2019 last line, when Pam tells us, \u201cBeauty in ordinary things\u2014isn\u2019t that kind of the point?\u201d", "The writers lost control of that mantra, but when you watch \u201cThe Office\u201d now, if you peer past the shtick, the subtler details\u2014moments so strikingly mundane that they might have seemed invisible a year ago\u2014stand out. We might not have realized how going to the office lent our daily lives a sense of occasion, for example, but, seeing Stanley and Jim putting on their coats and scarves and trudging out the door, we do. There\u2019s a wistful frisson in remembering that feeling: that we hadn\u2019t accomplished everything we\u2019d hoped to, but that we\u2019d come back tomorrow, encounter the gang, and try, gamely, to give it another go. \u2666"], "authors": ["Sarah Larson", "Sarah Larso"], "keywords": ["fischer", "boss", "jones", "love", "office", "michael", "series", "tells", "podcasts", "shows", "american"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
