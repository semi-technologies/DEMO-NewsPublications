I was doing my first big, serious photoshoot, so I had a meeting with [the record producer] Mickie Most, and he asked: \u201cWhat would you like to wear?\u201d I said leather because I was a big Elvis fan \u2013 and he was kind of against it. He said it was old-fashioned, but I insisted, so he asked: \u201cWhat about a jumpsuit?\u201d", "I thought it was a really sensible, logical idea because I jump around a lot, and I knew it would help everything stay in one place. It was only when we got the pictures back that I realised, in my naivety, that it was a sexy outfit. It hadn\u2019t been my focus \u2013 I just wanted to wear leather \u2013 but I think that\u2019s good. It was an innocent sex appeal.", "The jumpsuit felt like \u201cme\u201d the second I put it on. It fit like a skin. I still wear them \u2013 it\u2019s a timeless look and one that suits me. It says a lot that, at 69, I can still wear a jumpsuit on stage. They don\u2019t last that long because you get soaking wet performing and eventually the thread just goes. If it\u2019s a working stage outfit, then it will last for about two years of gigs, so there have been slight variations over the years. I had one with patches on the knees, one with fringing and one in white leather with the US flag on it. But the basic style, with the zipper from the top going down and the cuffs rolled up so I could play my bass, has stayed.", "At the time [1973], wearing an outfit like this was still a shock. It just wasn\u2019t done back then \u2013 it wasn\u2019t done for a woman to even be in a rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. But I didn\u2019t wear it to shock; I just knew that I didn\u2019t have a niche to fit into, and that I needed to find my own style."], "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["style", "second", "wasnt", "outfit", "realised", "lot", "wear", "suzi", "stage", "leather", "look", "shock", "pictures", "sexy", "quatro"], "id": "925c09c9-d80f-393e-a714-b85f354b091e", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783", "authors": ["Leah Harper", "As Told To"], "title": "Suzi Quatro: \u2018It was only when we got the pictures back that I realised it was a sexy outfit\u2019"}
