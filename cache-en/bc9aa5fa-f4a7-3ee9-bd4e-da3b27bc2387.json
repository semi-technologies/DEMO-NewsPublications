Labels such as Balenciaga, Christian Dior, A.P.C., and more have offered their version for spring 2021. And every season, a trendsetting model will also step out in a head-to-toe jean ensemble, making it suddenly feel cool and new again. Case and point: Yesterday, Bella Hadid was spotted in New York City rocking her take on the trend, and it couldn\u2019t have appeared more current. Her secret to keeping it fresh? It\u2019s all in the outfit\u2019s details.", "For starters, Hadid didn\u2019t wear any ol\u2019 denim trucker jacket to ground the look. Her jacket was a zip-up with roomy, oversized shoulders, that gave it a more modern silhouette. Underneath, she wore a gray 3.Paradis blazer as well as white tee and a V-neck sweater, which was an unexpected but sophisticated pairing. Her straight-leg jeans were cropped, drawing the eye to her white socks and chunky patent Prada loafers. The shoes combined with the collegiate-style sweater gave the look an appealing, preppy style. Don\u2019t sleep on her pearl jewelry, such as earrings by Jackie Mack Designs, and sleek tiny shades, either; these accessories gave the fit a more city-ready feel, too. So, make like Hadid the next time you\u2019re piling on your favorite jeans. Think less country-western vibes, more high-fashion school boy."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["white", "feel", "jeans", "hadid", "gave", "sweater", "denim", "tuxedo", "twist", "gives", "bella", "jacket", "canadian", "preppy", "piling", "look"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
