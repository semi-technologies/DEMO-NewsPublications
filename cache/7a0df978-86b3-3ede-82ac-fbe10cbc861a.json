Until humanity admits it has failed to tackle the climate crisis and begins treating it as an emergency like the coronavirus pandemic, society will be unable to stop global heating, she said.", "In an interview with the Guardian, Thunberg said leaders were happy to set targets for decades into the future, but flinched when immediate action to cut emissions was needed. She said there was not a politician on the planet promising the climate action required: \u201cIf only,\u201d said the teenager, who will turn 18 in January.", "But she is inspired by the millions of students who have taken up the school strike she began by herself in Sweden 116 weeks ago. Since then she has addressed the UN and become the world\u2019s most prominent climate campaigner. She also has hope: \u201cWe can treat a crisis like a crisis, as we have seen because of the coronavirus. Treating the climate crisis like a crisis \u2013 that could change everything overnight.\u201d", "Thunberg said the scale and speed of the emissions reductions needed to keep global temperature close to the limit set by the Paris climate agreement are so great that they cannot be achieved by the normal operation of society. \u201cOur whole society would just shut down and too many people would suffer,\u201d she said.", "\u201cSo the first thing we need to do is understand we are in an emergency [and] admit the fact that we have failed \u2013 humanity collectively has failed \u2013 because you can\u2019t solve a crisis that you don\u2019t understand,\u201d Thunberg said.", "A vital UN climate summit had been scheduled to begin on Monday in Glasgow but has been postponed for a year because of Covid-19. Thunberg, however, said she was not disappointed by the delay: \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t treat the climate crisis like a crisis, we can have as many conferences as we want, but it will just be negotiations, empty words, loopholes and greenwash.\u201d", "She is also unimpressed with pledges by nations including the UK, China and Japan to reach net zero by 2050 or 2060. \u201cThey mean something symbolically, but if you look at what they actually include, or more importantly exclude, there are so many loopholes. We shouldn\u2019t be focusing on dates 10, 20 or even 30 years in the future. If we don\u2019t reduce our emissions now, then those distant targets won\u2019t mean anything because our carbon budgets will be long gone.\u201d", "Thunberg is particularly scathing about the EU\u2019s MEPs who in October approved almost \u20ac400bn (\u00a3360bn) in subsidies for farmers, the majority of which has weak or non-existent green conditions attached. Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, and Thunberg said: \u201cIt is a disaster for the climate and for biodiversity.\u201d", "She said MEPs had asked for her support in September when the EU was deciding its target for emissions cuts by 2030. \u201cWhen it\u2019s about something that is in 10 years\u2019 time, they are more than happy to vote for it because that doesn\u2019t really impact them. But when it\u2019s something that actually has an effect, right here right now, they don\u2019t want to touch it. It really shows the hypocrisy.\u201d", "Thunberg said she will back the best party available when she reaches voting age, but that there were no politicians she rates as good: \u201cIf only. I wish there was one politician or one party that was strong enough on these issues. Imagine how easy it would be if you could just support a politician.\u201d", "Justice is at the heart of her campaigning, Thunberg said. \u201cThat is the root of all this,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are fighting for climate justice, social justice. They are so interlinked, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d", "\u201cThe climate crisis is just one symptom of a much larger crisis, [including] the loss of biodiversity, the loss of fertile soil but also including inequality and threats to democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are symptoms that we are not living sustainably: we have reached the end of the road.\u201d", "On campaigning, Thunberg said: \u201cWe need to do everything we can to push in the right direction. But I don\u2019t see the point of being optimistic or pessimistic, I\u2019m just realistic. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not happy, I\u2019m very happy. You need to have fun, and I\u2019m having much more now than before I started campaigning for this. When your life gets meaning you become happy.\u201d", "She said she was inspired by fellow school strikers. \u201cIt is so inspiring to see them because they are so determined and so brave,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cIn some countries, they even get arrested for striking. For instance, Arshak Makichyan in Russia, he had troubles with the police, but he just continues because he knows what he\u2019s doing is right. And then also in places like China, Howey Ou is incredibly brave.\u201d", "The school strikers brought headline-grabbing crowds to the streets of cities and towns around the world before the coronavirus pandemic, but are now largely confined to online activism. \u201cWe are still around and we will have to keep pushing, unfortunately. But we will. We\u2019re not planning to go away,\u201d Thunberg said."], "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "keywords": ["greta", "climate", "emissions", "greenwash", "blasts", "thunberg", "crisis", "happy", "school", "hypocrites", "dont", "leaders", "im", "society", "right"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
