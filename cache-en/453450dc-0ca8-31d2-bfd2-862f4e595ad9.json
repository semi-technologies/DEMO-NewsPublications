And then the designers started to send them things. We had a huge entryway filled with racks of clothes.\u201d Paris, in particular, had an experimental flair. \u201cParis could go to Patricia Field, find a pair of pants or a skirt, and then she would pair it with one of my good jackets,\u201d Kathy says. \u201cShe was quite the character in the day.\u201d", "While they all have their own tastes, borrowing from each other\u2019s closets is all but a family tradition. \u201cThey make themselves very at home in the closet,\u201d says Kathy, adding that her handbags and jewelry are a particular hit with her daughters. Paris also recently borrowed one of her pink and white Chanel suits. \u201cI have kept a lot of beautiful things, including some gorgeous Valentino from the \u201990s,\u201d Kathy says. \u201cNicky actually wore one of them to the Met ball [in 2001]. It was a gorgeous yellow beaded skirt with a chiffon top, and it was to the knee, which was unusual for the Met ball. And she borrowed one of my very good necklaces. I didn\u2019t even know until I saw the pictures!\u201d", "Photo: Camraface", "These days, they give fashion advice freely to each other. \u201cI don\u2019t buy anything, and they don\u2019t, unless we all agree on it,\u201d Kathy says. \u201cWe\u2019ll share ideas\u2014they\u2019ll ask me and I\u2019ll ask them.\u201d The number one fashion rule she\u2019s instilled in her daughters is, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put on everything in the closet,\u201d she says. As for what her daughters have taught her? \u201cI learned about Juicy Couture from them,\u201d she says, adding that she still has four of the beloved tracksuits today. \u201cThey both have their own style, and it\u2019s so interesting to just take little notes here and there.\u201d"], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["hilton", "learned", "kathy", "pair", "style", "daughters", "skirt", "dont", "nicky", "particular", "fashion", "started", "things", "paris"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
