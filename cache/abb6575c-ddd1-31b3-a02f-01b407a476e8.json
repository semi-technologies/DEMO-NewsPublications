His father was an engineer who designed aerial gliders.", "As a boy, Rubik loved to draw, paint and sculpt. He studied architecture at the Budapest University of Technology, then studied at the College of Applied Arts. He became obsessed with geometric patterns. As a professor, he taught a class called descriptive geometry, which involved teaching students to use two-dimensional images to represent three-dimensional shapes and problems. It was an odd and esoteric field, but it prepared him to develop the cube.", "In the spring of 1974, when he was 29, Rubik was in his bedroom at his mother\u2019s apartment, tinkering. He describes his room as resembling the inside of a child\u2019s pocket, with crayons, string, sticks, springs and scraps of paper scattered across every surface. It was also full of cubes he made, out of paper and wood."], "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"], "keywords": ["studied", "thats", "rubiks", "invented", "nature", "cubes", "rubik", "cube", "paper", "mind", "hes", "ideas", "start", "learning"], "pubDate": "2020-09-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
