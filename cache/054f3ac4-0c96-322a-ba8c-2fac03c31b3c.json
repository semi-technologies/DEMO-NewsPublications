Sophie is from England, in Italy on holiday. Tancredi is a Sicilian architect who is separated from his wife. They have spent the summer in a stately courtship, and Sophie has mostly managed to not think explicitly about its end. But the time has come for her to return home. There is no immediate obligation calling her back, but she is determined to go.", "Sophie struggles against their claustrophobic misery. As her mind gyres outward (\u201cAll around them, across the countryside, men and women went about their work or sat down to their lunch, talked and laughed\u2014or wept, as they wept now\u201d), she tries to \u201cfit this love into some immense, annihilating context of human experience, assailing it with her sense of proportion.\u201d Tancredi, wryly credited with being the one \u201cwho knew more about proportion,\u201d lifts his head. \u201cWhat could be worse than this?\u201d he asks Sophie. \u201cWhat could be worse?\u201d The chapter ends soon afterward, and the next one opens half a year later, during a winter of record-breaking freezes and deaths.", "These contrasts in scale\u2014individual and historical, intimate and epic\u2014occur throughout the novels of Shirley Hazzard, whose writing, like her name, tends to begin demurely enough, all weak tea and lace curtains, but grows quietly comic, and then abruptly calamitous. Her characters know poetry by heart, believe in honor, and speak in epigrams. Their biographies are revised, drastically, by plane crashes and shipwrecks, fatal battles, and grave illnesses. They travel widely and suffer emotional devastation.", "Hazzard, who died in 2016, at the age of eighty-five, once described her reading life as one of \u201cimpassioned humility.\u201d This is the effect of her books, too, in which vast, inhuman forces circumscribe her characters\u2019 most personal experiences. She was, as she told the Paris Review, skeptical of fiction that was \u201chard, cool, indifferent\u201d; she thought that literature should be \u201can intensification of life,\u201d not merely a skillful recapitulation of it.", "Hazzard was in her late twenties when she completed her first short story. She mailed her only copy to this magazine from Tuscany, where she was living in a vineyard-surrounded villa with a family of anti-Fascists. It was one of roughly thirty thousand unsolicited manuscripts that The New Yorker received annually at the time, but William Maxwell, the fiction editor, pulled it out of the slush pile and instructed Hazzard to send more.", "\u201cWoollahra Road,\u201d which closely heels to the consciousness of a small Depression-era Australian child, was, in 1961, the first story of Hazzard\u2019s that the magazine published. It now appears, along with twenty-seven others, in \u201cCollected Stories\u201d (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), edited by Brigitta Olubas, a literary scholar from the University of New South Wales who has edited a collection of academic essays on Hazzard and is at work on a biography. The stories, most of which were written in the nineteen-sixties, are often set in exotic locations\u2014the Gulf of Corinth, South China, Florence\u2014and are filled with short sentences of tossed-off-sounding sophistication: \u201cThe War Crimes people gave parties that lasted all night\u201d; \u201cThe Danish couple and the Greek guide speak French among themselves.\u201d", "In \u201cThe Picnic,\u201d from 1962, Hazzard came upon a theme that preoccupied her for a lifetime: the way love can be at once perishable and, in its reshaping of our minds, permanent. Nettie and Clem\u2014distant relatives by marriage, illicit lovers long ago\u2014sit in awkward silence on a hillside. The story contains hardly any dialogue. It is the first time they have seen each other in a decade. Clem takes note of Nettie\u2019s inappropriate dress, which she has (predictably, he thinks) stained. Nettie observes Clem\u2019s faded face and dreary caution. Their private thoughts construct a history of their relationship and reveal what they both deny to themselves: that they have lastingly altered each other\u2019s very cognition; that each still intrudes on the other\u2019s thoughts almost every day; that they are themselves, in some ways, because of each other. Although they have not been together in years, they have, in this sense, never quite been apart. Love, which takes place in the mind, is eternal, \u201cthe only state\u201d in which \u201call one\u2019s capacities\u201d are engaged. The entire story spans just a few minutes.", "In \u201cCollected Stories,\u201d we see Hazzard practicing the floor routines of her later novels, sticking all the landings if not always having yet worked out the full choreography. The erudite similes and lethally precise adjectives are there, as are the astute observations about domestic phenomena. The sentences of shocking wisdom appear freakishly often. The intelligence is relentless. Hazzardians will read \u201cCollected Stories\u201d with impatient pleasure, reminded from the first page that, once they are through, they can start rereading the novels.", "The globe-trotting cosmopolitanism of Hazzard\u2019s own life emerged out of a childhood in what she described as \u201ca remote, philistine country.\u201d Growing up in Sydney, Australia, with a bipolar mother and an alcoholic father, Hazzard yearned for the authority of England, with its smoking chimneys, hedgerows, and correctly timed seasons. When it was winter in Australia, it was summer everywhere that seemed to count. \u201cLiterature had not simply made these things true,\u201d she writes in \u201cThe Transit of Venus,\u201d her 1980 masterpiece. \u201cIt had placed Australia in perpetual, flagrant violation of reality.\u201d", "Her early education was conducted at a school that primed its young charges with poetry, but it soon became impossible to ignore the conflagration that had overtaken Europe and the Pacific. Already Hazzard was familiar with the wounded veterans of the Great War who hobbled down the streets of Sydney, and, as a child, she had once been evacuated to the countryside with her fellow-students. \u201cI had been raised in the climate of war,\u201d she wrote half a century later, having by then published five books of fiction absolutely rife with combat imagery.", "Hiroshima was a wasteland when Hazzard arrived there at the age of sixteen, less than two years after the attack. She saw a city where (as a character in one of her novels puts it) \u201cthe crust of the earth had been lifted off only to reveal more man-made horrors beneath.\u201d The family was en route to Hong Kong, where Hazzard\u2019s father had accepted a diplomatic post. Once there, having quit school, she found a job working for British intelligence; on her time off, she read literature with an autodidact\u2019s reverence for tradition, and had a love affair with a British Army officer. After her sister contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to New Zealand. Hazzard said that the move was \u201ca sort of death.\u201d Heartbroken in Wellington, she studied Italian and read Leopardi.", "The family moved again, in 1951, to New York City, where Hazzard took an underpaid secretarial job in the \u201cdungeons\u201d of the United Nations, a hellish experience on which she drew heavily in \u201cPeople in Glass Houses,\u201d a collection of linked satirical stories published in 1967. Though her disappointment in the institution, with its squandering of talent and its misplaced ideals, is the subject of two nonfiction books of hers, \u201cPeople in Glass Houses\u201d conjures the dark comedy of a place where co-workers banter on rugs donated by the Republic of Panama and officials carry on about freedom as though it were \u201csome extinct creature being pickled in a jar of spirits.\u201d", "Like one of her fictional U.N. employees, Hazzard has said that she was granted a \u201cmiraculous\u201d reprieve by the Suez Crisis, when, at the age of twenty-five, she was sent to Naples for a year. In a \u201cblitzed town\u201d where the streets had been littered with both shrapnel and Vesuvian ash, Hazzard learned to take ceremony seriously and to live amid history. In 1963, the year that \u201cCliffs of Fall,\u201d her first story collection, appeared, she married Francis Steegmuller, the recently widowed Flaubert scholar. The couple settled in Manhattan but spent half of every year in Capri. There they befriended Graham Greene, after Hazzard met the novelist in a caf\u00e9 and helpfully supplied him with the last line of a Robert Browning poem he was struggling to remember. (Their friendship was the subject of Hazzard\u2019s \u201cGreene on Capri,\u201d a short memoir, published in 2000 and filled with sentences like \u201cWe were speaking of Dryden.\u201d)", "By the decade\u2019s end, she had published her first two novels, \u201cThe Evening of the Holiday\u201d (1966) and \u201cThe Bay of Noon\u201d (1970). Delightfully outmoded and set in Italy\u2014whose summer sky, in a lapse of cosmic good taste, is colored \u201can injudicious paint-box azure\u201d\u2014both are about self-knowledge, love, and epicurean errands. (Hazzard bristled at comparisons to Henry James, whose \u201cgreatness\u201d she conceded only with reservations.) Still, like a Jamesian character, she felt herself, in Italy, to be \u201cliving more completely among the scenes and sentiments of a humanism the New World could not provide\u201d; centuries seemed to collapse in on themselves all around her. It was the country\u2019s constant \u201cadmixture of immediacy and continuity, of the long perspective and the intensely personal\u201d that, in the coming decades, bloomed in each of her books.", "Though Hazzard\u2019s politics were left-leaning, her self-presentation was decidedly Old World\u2014starched shirts, a closet full of Chanel tweeds. In an act of treasonous grooming, she wore her hair pinned up in a bouffant through the late nineteen-sixties and seventies. She spoke in a muted British accent that was the muddied average of all the English-speaking countries in which she had lived. \u201cIf a highly intelligent and principled moth were able to talk,\u201d the art critic John Russell once said about Hazzard, \u201cthat is what she would sound like.\u201d A young friend lovingly characterized her as \u201cpreposterous, though not absurd,\u201d and recalled her speaking \u201cin full, long paragraphs without line breaks.\u201d", "With far-flung origins, an itinerant coming of age, and a husband a quarter century her senior, Hazzard lived a life remote from those of her contemporaries. She disliked television and, later, literary theory and personal computers. Her fiction, which is about straight, white, well-read expatriates who speak to one another in mannered, idea-dense dialogue, was old-fashioned even at the time (\u201cVictorian,\u201d per the book reviews). Yet, if the turbulence of privileged spheres feels familiar, the intensity and precision of her focus does not.", "\u201cScruple was a tiny measure, used perhaps by a jeweler or a chemist,\u201d Aldred Leith muses in \u201cThe Great Fire\u201d (2003), Hazzard\u2019s final and most autobiographical novel. Leith, a wounded British soldier travelling through postwar Asia, has fallen in love with the much younger Helen Driscoll, an Australian teen-ager living in occupied Japan: \u201cHe had never dealt, in love or otherwise, in such minute quantities.\u201d These are the quantities\u2014subjective, invisible to the naked eye\u2014with which Hazzard most often deals. The intellectual thrill of her work arises from her ability to describe the small, constituent particles of emotional matter we typically consider irreducible. A character in her 1964 story \u201cComfort\u201d notes that \u201cnot kind\u201d was a more damning characterization of a person than \u201ccruel,\u201d as it \u201cimplied having understood the principle of kindness and having rejected it.\u201d Confidence, another observes in \u201cThe Party,\u201d published two years earlier, is \u201cone of those things we try to instill into others and then hasten to dispel as soon as it puts in an appearance.\u201d Then, the corrosive rejoinder: \u201cLike love.\u201d", "Writing about \u201cThe Transit of Venus\u201d in the third person feels a bit like telling a lie by omission. I first read the book two years ago and have reread it five times since, finishing it always with the impression that something very real and a little beyond language has happened to me. I\u2019m desperate to talk about the book with those who have read it, and find myself at some remove from those who haven\u2019t. In this way\u2014Was it like this for you, too?\u2014the novel is akin to sex or drugs or physical pain. \u201cA state of mind,\u201d one character warns another, \u201cwill overtake you like an event.\u201d Each time I begin the novel, I laugh a little at the first line, pretending for a moment that it refers to me: \u201cBy nightfall the headlines would be reporting devastation.\u201d", "\u201cThe Transit of Venus\u201d opens, like a fairy tale, in the middle of a storm. Ted Tice, a young man carrying a decaying suitcase, appears at the door of his future employer, an arrogant astronomer of wealth and stature. At the astronomer\u2019s lavish English country home, Ted meets Grace and Caroline Bell, two beautiful orphaned sisters\u2014one fair, one dark\u2014who have left their far-off kingdom of Australia in search of a new life in a more civilized world. Grace, the fair sister, is engaged to the astronomer\u2019s son, a seething civil servant named Christian Thrale. Ted falls in love with the dark sister, Caroline, who herself is in love with Paul Ivory, a manipulative playwright engaged to an aristocrat from a nearby manor.", "From this cut-diamond opening, the rest of the novel\u2019s plot flickers and refracts. Caroline, known as Caro, has an affair with Paul and, when it ends, is overtaken by a desperate depression. She is rescued by a gallant American of virtuous pursuits, whom she marries. Christian and Grace temporarily fall in love with other people. The years pass, Ted rises to professional prominence and gets married himself. Still, he loves Caro, who has become for him a legend. And then a rival dies, a lifelong love is returned. When calamity strikes, we realize it was always to be so\u2014that breadcrumbs, dropped for years, have made a trail leading straight to tragedy."], "authors": ["Alice Gregory", "Alice Gregor"], "keywords": ["shirley", "published", "read", "life", "novels", "outsized", "hazzard", "age", "having", "hazzards", "intimacy", "young", "love", "art"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
