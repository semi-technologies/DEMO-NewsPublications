Companies cannot remain neutral on issues of conscience, even if it means losing some customers. \u201cYou have to take a stand on something,\u201d insisted Mr Knight, as Nike, the sportswear firm he dreamed up while studying at Stanford in the 1960s, had done by supporting Colin Kaepernick, an American footballer who refused to stand during the pre-game national anthem in protest against racial injustice.", "Woke stuff\u2014and lucrative to boot, if Nike\u2019s financial performance is anything to go by. The company\u2019s revenues rose by 7% in the three months to August, year on year, to $10.7bn. Profits were up by a quarter, as, so far this year, is the share price.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Ironic, then, that Nike must now fend off accusations of distinctly unwoke behaviour. In May it was shamed into undoing a policy of slashing pay for female athletes it sponsors when they get pregnant. An earlier scandal over allegations of sexual harassment and abuse of female workers led to the dismissal of nearly a dozen male executives. And this week Nike has been embroiled in an ugly doping affair, which dragged its share price down by 3%.", "On September 30th America\u2019s anti-doping watchdog found Alberto Salazar, a star running coach who counts Olympic gold medallists as clients, and Jeffrey Brown, a physician, guilty of \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d and banned both from athletics for four years. Mr Salazar ran the Nike Oregon Project, a programme for elite athletes; he has a Nike swoosh tattooed on his arm.", "Nike denies wrongdoing. Mr Salazar and Dr Brown are expected to appeal against the ruling. In a message to employees this week, Nike\u2019s current boss, Mark Parker, reportedly wrote that the idea of doping runners \u201cmakes me sick\u201d. Yet emails between him, Mr Salazar and Dr Brown, reported by the Wall Street Journal, seem to suggest he was aware of their tests. A Nike spokesman told the newspaper that at the time the coach was \u201cconcerned that Nike runners could be sabotaged by someone rubbing testosterone cream on them\u201d. Mr Parker called the news reports \u201chighly misleading\u201d. Perhaps. But Mr Knight\u2019s dictum may yet come back to bite the company he created.\u25a0"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2019/10/05/nike-is-embroiled-in-a-doping-scandal", "title": "Nike is embroiled in a doping scandal", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["brown", "mr", "nike", "scandal", "stand", "embroiled", "stanford", "share", "doping", "runners", "salazar", "week"]}
