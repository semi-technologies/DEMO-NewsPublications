Until the coronavirus pandemic struck, he participated in book fairs and other events. Now with those events cancelled, he is surviving solely on home deliveries. But the pandemic has proved to be a bit of a boon, as people spending more time at home rediscover the joy of books.", "\u201cSome customers have counted how many books they\u2019ve read since March, and the numbers are significant,\u201d Santini said.", "For 20 years, Santini owned a bookshop in Milan\u2019s Largo Mahler, opposite the auditorium that houses the Giuseppe Verdi Symphony Orchestra, which made the store particularly popular among those seeking specialist music books. But he was forced to close in 2013 after the business became financially unviable.", "Luca Santini on his bike. Photograph: Luca Santini", "\u201cIt was a great experience and had done well,\u201d said Santini. \u201cBut things became more difficult with the arrival of online competition, the general decline in reading books and the financial crisis in 2008. I tried and tried, and people in the neighbourhood also organised initiatives to support the shop, but we had to close.\u201d", "As he pondered what to do next, Santini discovered he could apply for a licence to operate as a travelling salesperson. And so he became the first to apply for one for the sale of books.", "\u201cI have always cycled around the city and so decided to try it out,\u201d he said.", "People can order through Santini\u2019s Facebook page or by sending him a message on WhatsApp. They can pay online or in in cash.", "His is also among around 2,000 other booksellers across Italy who recently united in their goal to challenge Amazon by setting up their own online platform, called Bookdealer.", "The venture is the first of its kind in Italy and allows people to search for books and to locate the nearest bookshop to them, as well as take virtual tours of shops, before purchasing online for home delivery. The initiative is particularly useful for people in towns where bookshops have closed, as they can discover stores that are further away. Customers can also seek the kind of advice they would ordinarily get from an independent bookseller.", "They have a long way to go before the battle can be declared won, but Santini believes it is this personal element that sets them apart from the giants.", "Luca Santini at his mobile stall. Photograph: Luca Santini", "\u201cBookdealer started at the end of August and many people are turning to this option,\u201d said Santini. \u201cThey might not get a discount like they would on Amazon but they do get a well-curated service, professionalism and the chance to speak to a book expert.\u201d", "That people are using the service is a positive sign, especially after data released at the beginning of the year showed that 2,300 bookshops had closed in the previous five years. At the time, Paolo Ambrosini, the president of the Italian Booksellers Association, criticised the government for not doing enough to support the sector in the face of online competition.", "Santini said the pandemic has helped in the sense that people have realised more the importance of independent local businesses.", "\u201cThere is a specific solidarity that is being shown,\u201d he added.", "\u201dThe situation is still not easy for many but the personal connection has helped people feel united with us.\u201d"], "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "keywords": ["booksellers", "books", "bicycling", "luca", "milans", "pandemic", "giants", "santini", "italy", "customers", "bike", "online", "im", "faster", "independent", "bookseller", "takes"], "pubDate": "2020-12-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
