What we don't know, though, Guy, is whether this tightening in the polls we're seeing is the normal tightening you see in the late stages of an election cycle. It's a it's a common phenomenon. So we don't know whether this tightening is simply that an election that the shape of the election hasn't really changed or whether it is something more than that. The best case against it being something more than that is the fact that so many people have voted. The margins are so very tight and they're just not. There's just not much not much vote left out there. So for him to pull off what he did four years ago is made more difficult by that by that fact. But I wouldn't rule it out. I just think I think he's got, he's got a path. It's narrow, but it's there. But the odds, I don't think, favor him at this point. But I'm certainly not positive about that.\"", "Listen To The Full Interview Below:"], "authors": ["Wyatt Dobrovichfago"], "keywords": ["election", "guy", "chances", "brit", "path", "think", "hume", "narrow", "hes", "president", "dont", "know", "reelection", "trumps", "tightening"], "pubDate": "2020-11-02T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
