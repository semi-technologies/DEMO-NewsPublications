But things are already hotting up on Heisteeg, and she\u2019s had to appoint a team of \u2018street managers\u2019 \u2013 two young women, and the father of a colleague \u2013 to keep order at weekends. \u2018I don\u2019t have any choice,\u2019 she says. \u2018It\u2019s a really narrow street, so it gets blocked easily.\u2019", "Customers clutch not just purses, but smartphones and cameras. The shop\u2019s nostalgically photogenic interior is very Instagrammable, with its stained glass, wooden counter, antique chandelier, and old-fashioned dumbwaiter bringing the cookies down from upstairs. There\u2019s even a miniature roller coaster in the window. The store looks like it\u2019s been there for centuries, but Vera created it from scratch.", "Its success has nothing to do with slick marketing campaigns: she thought long and hard about running one, but decided against it. \u201cWe\u2019ve never spent a single euro on advertising,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I started out, my brother calculated that even if I sold 220 cookies a day, which I often did, I\u2019d never turn a profit.\u201d", "Employees are allowed to eat up to eighteen cookies a day for free. Beeld Lin Woldendorp", "She\u2019s now up to 3,000 a day. \u201cIt\u2019s all down to word of mouth, social media, and sites like TripAdvisor. I\u2019d never actually heard of TripAdvisor, but we went straight to number one on their list of Amsterdam\u2019s best places to shop.\u201d", "It started five years ago when Vera, a former psychology student, decided to create the perfect cookie. \u201cI had an exact mental picture of what I wanted: crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.\u201d She spent months experimenting with different types of sugar and chocolate, and using family and friends as guinea pigs. \u201cOne February day I discovered the ultimate cookie, and we all agreed it was awesome. I decided to use Valrhona chocolate. I wasn\u2019t actually planning to sell cookies, but there was no stopping me after that: they were the first thing I thought about when I woke up each day, and I decided to sell them so more people could try them.\u201d", "Experts warned against this strategy: one cookie wouldn\u2019t be enough, and she should offer at least fifteen different flavours. She ignored their advice, and started selling warm cookies at two euro each. \u201cI gradually started getting more and more customers, and many of them bought not just one, but boxes of six or nine.\u201d", "No entry", "At first there was just Vera and one other person working in the store, but now ten staff bake and sell cookies all day, on two floors of a long, narrow building with a footprint of only eighteen square metres. The fresh cookies emerge from the oven and are dispatched downstairs in the dumbwaiter.", "Bakers in black plastic gloves juggle balls of dark chocolate dough, which take as little as eight seconds to make, and end up as flat cookies.", "\u201cIt took me probably two months to get the hang of it,\u201d says Christa Smit, 32, who has worked in the store for four years. \u201cYou have to get the dough exactly right, so you can roll it around the white chocolate. It\u2019s a real knack.\u201d The job is enviable not just for the fun, friendly atmosphere, but because employees are allowed to eat up to eighteen cookies a day for free.", "People regularly ask for the recipe, but staff are under strict orders not to disclose it. The dough room, in a basement on Spuistraat, is off limits to everyone except Vera and three of her colleagues, who start kneading at six in the morning. \u201cWe have an order for 250 cookies today,\u201d Vera says. \u201cSometimes I get calls from foreigners making stopovers at Schiphol. They ask me to have some ready, and come and pick them up by taxi.\u201d", "Sana Sarkawt, a regular customer, is en route to Schiphol herself. \u201cI used to work at The Seafood Bar around the corner, and I\u2019d treat myself to a cookie here afterwards. I\u2019ve been hooked ever since. I\u2019m off to visit family in London, and I\u2019m taking thirty euros\u2019 worth of cookies with me. My aunt loves them, so here I am in the queue again!\u201d", "Owner Vera van Stapele: \u201cWhen I started out, my brother calculated that even if I sold 220 cookies a day, which I often did, I\u2019d never turn a profit.\u201d Beeld Lin Woldendorp", "Expansion", "Many business owners would give their right arms for queues like Vera\u2019s, but it\u2019s not all roses. \u201cI\u2019m getting fewer locals than I used to. They can\u2019t be bothered to stand in line, and I can\u2019t say I blame them. I\u2019ve looked at ways around the problem, such as an online ticketing system, but I soon went off that idea. It\u2019s just not us.\u201d", "But loyal customers find it hard to stay away. A sports fanatic by the name of Peter, was worried that the cookies were less than healthy. \u201cHe bought two, one for that day and one for the next, but once he\u2019d eaten the first, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the second. At a quarter past midnight he decided that this was now the next day, so he got out of bed and ate the second cookie by candlelight. He\u2019s been a regular ever since.\u201d", "Vera often fields calls from people asking whether she plans to expand to other cities, or abroad. \u201cThey usually phone after the weekend, when they\u2019ve seen the long queues, and they smell money. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing that. I want to keep it as small as possible, and my sole aim is to have fun baking and selling cookies. They started as colleagues, but now they\u2019re friends.\u201d"], "authors": ["Marloes De Moor", "Translation", "Het Vertaalcollectief"], "keywords": ["outside", "day", "van", "theres", "stapele", "im", "cookie", "decided", "queue", "vera", "chocolate", "cookies", "started", "theyre"], "pubDate": "2019-07-29T12:34:15Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
