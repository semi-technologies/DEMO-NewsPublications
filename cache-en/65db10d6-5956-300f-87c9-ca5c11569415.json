This year, I\u2019m spending it at my cottage in Padstow. I\u2019ll be cooking goose with sage and onion stuffing, potatoes roasted in goose fat with artichokes and parsnips and a melange of vegetables \u2013 broccoli, peas, broad beans and carrots \u2013 all cut small and braised in butter and tarragon. It\u2019s not traditional but I can\u2019t have Christmas at my place without two or three dozen native oysters from the river Fal to start, and Cornish blue cheese instead of stilton with the port.", "Pasta and mustard fruits", "Angela Hartnett, chef patron at Murano and Cafe Murano, London, and Cucina Angelina, Courchevel, France", "This Christmas, we\u2019ll be eating pasta, followed by roast turkey (although last year we opted for roast capon \u2013 a tip from Italian chef Giorgio Locatelli, whose grandfather used to make it). My family\u2019s signature dish is a brilliant stuffing made from wilted spinach, ricotta and a touch of parmesan, rolled into a ballotine log. You can either roast it in foil or you can stuff it in the end of a turkey. For me, it all tastes better the next day. I love leftovers such as cold turkey with cranberries and Italian chutneys \u2013 in particular mustard fruits, which are made with crystallised fruits preserved in syrup and flavoured with mustard-seed oil.", "Sushi and a black forest gateau", "Roll of the diced ... sushi under construction.

We used to do traditional Christmas dinners, but found that customers wanted alternatives to turkey: goose, beef and lamb. But at home we always have a turkey. I\u2019m a big fan. I take off the legs and cook them separately. I\u2019ll also make sushi with my daughter and a black forest gateau for Boxing Day. If you want to enjoy the day, you need to be prepared when it comes to the food but people do tend to over-shop at Christmas, which I always try to suppress. As a chef, I find it bizarre.", "Yorkshire puddings and gravy", "Just for starters ... Yorkshire pudding.

My husband and his brother do a traditional turkey with all the trimmings, and always start off with Yorkshire puddings and gravy (he\u2019s a northerner!). Instead, I look after New Year\u2019s Eve, which is quite a big deal in Japan. I prepare a traditional Japanese New Year\u2019s feast of osechi: pickles and preserves that represent health and fortune.", "Cured fish and eggs", "Marianna Leivaditaki, head chef at Morito, London", "My partner and I grew up in Crete, so we tend to do things a little differently in our house. We always start the day with cured fish and eggs (a staple around the festive season in Crete) \u2013 often ouzo-cured salmon or fenugreek-rubbed cod. We prepare a traditional Greek chestnut and baby onion stew, with warming aromatic spices, usually served as a main but also the perfect veggie side dish for a roast. Throughout the day, we\u2019ll have roasted chestnuts on the fire with a couple of glasses of Metaxa while chatting and playing games.", "Thai salad and laab-style stuffing", "Saiphin Moore, co-owner Rosa\u2019s Thai Cafe, nationwide", "On Christmas Day, I have tea and then I\u2019m in the kitchen by 7am, preparing the turkey and peeling vegetables. I make two stuffings, one traditional and one in laab-style balls, and two gravies, one traditional and one with chilli powder. For me, everything has to have a punchy flavour. In the evening, I use the leftover turkey to make a light Thai salad. Sometimes my daughter will help with dessert: we have Christmas pudding and light the whisky on top. Every Sunday is like Christmas for me: we always have a big family meal.", "Pepperpot", "Feel the heat ... pepperpot.

It\u2019s a meat stew and the recipe goes back to when there was no refrigeration: you leave it in a clay pot and boil it for an hour every day. One of the ingredients is cassareep, which comes from the cassava root and acts as a preservative. It also contains cloves, cinnamon, and star anise \u2013 it\u2019s a very warming dish, quite unique. My mum would not have a Christmas without pepperpot \u2013 and she does it so well that I never touch it.

My parents have an outdoor wood oven/barbecue, so we usually use that to cook a large fish, like a massive turbot or brill, which will feed 12-16 people. We\u2019ve also done a rotisserie-style salmon. There\u2019s smoked salmon, mackerel pat\u00e9, prawns with different dips, baked oysters \u2026 On Christmas Day, my mum and I cook a classic Christmas spread \u2013 there\u2019s always tons of food and the meal goes on for five or six hours.", "Brussel tops and celeriac mash", "James Lowe, chef and founder of Lyle\u2019s, London", "I tend to visit relatives over three or four days at Christmas \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to eat the same foods three or four days in a row, so I cook something on Christmas Day that I can turn into something to take to my aunt\u2019s on Boxing Day. I did turkey once but never again \u2013 it\u2019s a big faff. Goose is really nice \u2013 the proportions are better than on a turkey. I take the legs off, roast the crown and braise the legs, and put them with chicken stock, prunes, bacon and cook in a casserole dish. I only ever do one or two carbs and a green vegetable \u2013 brussel tops and celeriac mash are favourites. The next day, I take all the leftovers and make it into a pie mix with a puff pastry lid.", "Turkey sandwiches", "Matthew Ryle, head chef at Maison Fran\u00e7ois, London", "Christmas lunch is my job and it\u2019s a fairly standard affair: turkey (brined overnight) wrapped in lots of streaky bacon, pigs in blankets, stuffing (always Paxo sage and onion), cauliflower cheese, duck-fat potatoes, roasted brussels with chestnuts and bacon, braised red cabbage, carrots, Yorkshire puddings, gravy, bread sauce and cranberry sauce. Then there\u2019s a load of cheese that is picked at for the remainder of the day. Later on, the turkey sandwiches are handed out: white crusty loaf, plenty of butter, cut into little squares \u2013 my nan makes them best.", "Candied figs and Jerusalem artichokes", "Paul Wedgwood, chef at Wedgwood the Restaurant, Edinburgh", "We usually start the day with fruit, followed by something light, like a salad, for lunch. Then we go all out for Christmas dinner \u2013 it\u2019s always been an evening meal in my family. This year, I\u2019ve cured some grouse to make ham, which I\u2019m serving with celeriac remoulade, candied figs and pickled blackberries. Also Jerusalem artichokes \u2013 I can\u2019t get enough of them, I would eat them with everything. Then the showstopper is an ultra-free-range goose, served with all the trimmings. I don\u2019t have much of a sweet tooth so, afterwards, I prefer to have a very good cheese board to nibble at while watching a movie.", "Barbecued lobster", "Charlie Carroll, founder of Flat Iron, London", "I always barbecue at Christmas; glass of fizz, silly hat and a fire \u2013 magic. I usually choose a joint of beef taken from our own herd of cattle up in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, cooked whole over charcoal and wood embers. I might add a couple of lobsters from Pesky; they get them straight from a day boat in the fishing village of Beer in Devon, and they arrive by post 24 hours after they come out of the water. Amazing ingredients, sourced with care and cooked without too much fuss.", "Prawn cocktail and After Eights", "Square habit? After Eight mints.

Another family member always takes the role so I can put my feet up, but our Christmas dinner is as traditional as it gets: roast turkey and all the trimmings.

It\u2019s quite traditional, but we do always have a chicken broth soup with ravioli \u2013 something my Italian nana used to make on Christmas Day. When I was 16, I was diagnosed with a nut allergy, but my mum would always forget, so now I\u2019m in charge of dessert to guarantee I actually get some.
