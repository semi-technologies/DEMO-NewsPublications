The Wildcats fell just a few votes shy of cracking the Top 25 in both the AP and Coaches Polls, but they're about to be ranked in a big way after improving to 3-0 with a 21-13 win over Nebraska.", "For the second straight week, they had to rally from an early deficit. Against Iowa, Northwestern trailed 17-0 in the first quarter before pulling off a 21-20 victory. This week against the Cornhuskers, the Wildcats trailed 13-7 at halftime before another come-from-behind victory. Heck, even in the 43-3 win over Maryland, the Terrapins got on the board first before 43 unanswered points by Northwestern.", "Defense has been the name of the game for the Wildcats. In fact, they have yet to give up a single point in the second half thus far this season, and they have accumulated five second-half interceptions over the past two weeks. Twice against Nebraska, they ended long, should-have-been-scoring drives with red-zone interceptions.", "Granted, Maryland, Iowa and Nebraska doesn't exactly comprise a murderers' row. But aside from a home game against Wisconsin on Nov. 21, the schedule doesn't get any tougher for the Wildcats. Could they possibly go from 3-9 last year to the College Football Playoff?", "The Big Ten's more impressive 3-0 start, however, belongs to Indiana.", "The season-opening overtime win over Penn State was a shocker. This week's 38-21 victory over Michigan was a statement that this team means business.", "Two years ago, Kentucky snapped a 31-game losing streak against Florida, and that result was a clear, early sign that the Wildcats were headed for their best season in decades. The same could be said of the Hoosiers after snapping their 24-game losing streak against the Wolverines.", "I had major questions about the Indiana offense after its first two games, as the Hoosiers weren't even averaging 300 total yards per contest. But they absolutely smoked Michigan. Michael Penix Jr. threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns while the ground game added 118 yards and two more scores.", "Now the major question is: Can they do it on the road against Ohio State?", "That game is coming up in two weeks, followed two weeks later by a road game against Wisconsin. So the odds of an undefeated season here are still pretty slim. Still, Indiana should jump into the AP Top 10 for the first time since 1969.", "Regardless of how things play out over the next few weeks, locking up head coach Tom Allen on a seven-year, $27.3 million contract last December already looks like an amazing investment."], "authors": ["Kerry Miller"], "keywords": ["win", "victory", "brs", "season", "yards", "week", "weeks", "college", "wisconsin", "trailed", "football", "game", "25", "wildcats", "rankings"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "fa207f19-e080-3902-982c-393d321776be"}
