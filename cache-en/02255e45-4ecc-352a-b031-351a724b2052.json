Its two predecessors, 1970\u2019s McCartney and 1980\u2019s McCartney II, were greeted with widespread horror: it\u2019s a close-run thing, but they may be the worst-reviewed albums of Paul McCartney\u2019s entire career.", "Paul McCartney: McCartney III album cover", "Reeling in disbelief that the architect of She\u2019s Leaving Home and Hey Jude could offer up something so ramshackle as his solo debut, the Melody Maker suggested the former\u2019s contents were both \u201csheer banality\u201d and evidence that the really talented one in the Beatles was George Martin. McCartney II fared even worse: \u201celectronic junk \u2026 crude \u2026 torture\u201d offered one contemporaneous review, while another suggested that McCartney had \u201cshamed himself\u201d by releasing it.", "Today, McCartney and McCartney II are two of the most revered albums in their author\u2019s solo catalogue, moments where he temporarily forgot his commercial impulses \u2013 but not his innate gift for melody \u2013 and allowed his more experimental side free rein. One school of thought has the ragged, home-recorded McCartney as the forebear of the alt-rock subgenre that came to be known as lo-fi; the synth-heavy McCartney II has been rediscovered by DJs and hailed as presaging electronic bedroom pop.", "The disparity between the initial reviews and their later standing suggests that McCartney\u2019s one-man-band solo albums only reveal their true glory in the fullness of time, an idea that whirls around your head when you\u2019re confronted with McCartney III\u2019s Lavatory Lil. A jaunty excoriation of a gold-digger, the best thing you can say about it is that it isn\u2019t quite as awful as its title leads you to fear. There\u2019s always the chance that, by the middle of the century it\u2019ll be claimed as the worthy descendent of the Beatles\u2019 Polythene Pam, or the version of the ribald Liverpool folksong Maggie Mae that snuck on to Let It Be, but that feels a stretch: it\u2019s not as weird or funny as the former and nor does it have the latter\u2019s sense of history, Maggie Mae being a song the pre-Beatles skiffle band the Quarrymen used to perform. In fact, it feels more like a successor to the interminable joke track Bogey Music, one bit of McCartney II that not even the nuttiest Macca fan has attempted to reassess.", "If Lavatory Lil is a moment where the process behind McCartney III \u2013 recorded in lockdown, with its author in charge of everything \u2013 has led to a self-indulgent lapse of judgment, the rest of the album finds him letting his guard down in far more appealing ways. A certain freedom is evident in opener Long Tailed Winter Bird, a lovely instrumental that\u2019s allowed far more room to breathe than you suspect McCartney in more commercially minded mood would permit. He might also have balked at releasing Slidin\u2019 on the grounds that it was too obviously a homage to Queens of the Stone Age, albeit one laced with an infectious sense that its author is having a high old time.", "The trailer for McCartney III.", "Deep Deep Feeling, meanwhile, may be the best song to bear McCartney\u2019s name in more than a decade. Its melodies slowly entwine and uncoil over eight minutes involving lengthy instrumental passages, falsetto vocals, shifts in tempo, a Mellotron-esque synth that recalls the opening of Strawberry Fields Forever (as with Winter Bird/When Winter Comes\u2019 nod to the bucolic atmosphere of 1971\u2019s Ram, it\u2019s the kind of musical self-reference that never seems accidental on a McCartney album) and an acoustic coda. The lyrical examination of emotional extremes feels authentically confessional. Similarly personal, if more oblique, Pretty Boys puts the audibly aged aspect of his voice to use, quaveringly describing its titular subject as \u201ca line of bicycles for hire, objects of desire \u2026 a row of cottages for rent for your main event\u201d.", "It\u2019s moving because he knows of what he speaks. This isn\u2019t a superannuated rocker sneering at latter-day manufactured pop bands, but something fonder and more personal: a man knocking on 80 who was the subject of teen hysteria a lifetime ago, who gave up playing live because he couldn\u2019t hear himself over the screaming. Seize the Day features the prickly, defensive McCartney of Silly Love Songs \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s still all right to be nice,\u201d he protests, a sentiment that gains heft in a world of snarling binary divisions \u2013 set to a melody that\u2019s almost preposterously McCartney-esque, navigating its twists and turns without appearing to break a sweat.", "There are moments of filler \u2013 Deep Down\u2019s vaguely R&B-ish groove rambles a little \u2013 but this is the most straightforwardly enjoyable and certainly the most personal McCartney album since 2005\u2019s haunted, twilit Chaos and Creation in the Backyard. As to whether it joins Volumes I and II in the pantheon of undisputed solo McCartney classics, time will tell: as the afterlife of its predecessors demonstrates, the future is hard to predict.", "\u2022 McCartney III is released on 18 December.", "This week Alexis listened to", "Robin Guthrie and Harold Budd: Very Slender Homage", "From the album released a week before Budd\u2019s death, Another Flower, an appropriately titled sliver of delicate beauty."], "authors": ["Alexis Petridis"], "keywords": ["iii", "personal", "album", "feels", "songs", "solo", "paul", "lockdown", "lp", "winter", "melody", "ii", "mccartneys", "review", "best", "mccartney"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
