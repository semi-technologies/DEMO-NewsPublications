Her mother kept the interior clean and minimalist, devoid of objects, trinkets, or bold decor. But her grandmother, on the other hand, lived in a cabinet of curiosities. Wandler spent much time there while growing up in Amsterdam, and those surroundings, filled with floral wallpaper, red velour sofas, pottery, and vases, made an impression on her. Today, Wandler is the designer and founder of her eponymous accessories label, which fuses modern, architectural silhouettes and clean lines with pops of color. Her sleek, effortlessly cool shoes and bags have garnered a cult following since Wandler launched in 2017. But a while back, she began to realize that she had a passion for interior design and decor, thanks in large part to her grandmother\u2019s vibrant eye. Specifically, the designer looked to her own home in Amsterdam and the beautiful array of hand-sculpted vases that she\u2019s been collecting for years.", "", "Launching for Brown\u2019s 50th Anniversary today, Wandler has teamed up with three artists for a capsule collection of decor items that include glass and ceramic objets and vases, as well as glass jugs. The designs are all surrealist and bulbous in their shapes and come in a range of hues\u2014like baby pink, lime, deep green, black, and sand\u2014that are meant to match her latest sculptural pre-spring 2021 collection of bags and shoes. Elza\u2019s collaborators are Helle Mardahl, a Copenhagen designer who crafts candy-colored confection, Fleur Hulleman, a ceramicist from the Netherlands, and Jochen Holz, a glassblower based in east London. The pieces are all available exclusively at Browns and on the Wandler website. \u201cWe wanted to create pieces that would complement people\u2019s interiors in their homes,\u201d the designer explains. \u201cAlthough accessories like our shoes and bags are made to be functional, I also love everything that doesn\u2019t have a specific, functional purpose.\u201d", "", "Wandler describes the new pieces as \u201cmini works of art,\u201d and she has a very clear passion for this home-focused facet of the design world. In fact, she has worked with Mardhal, Holz, and Hulleman before on the curation and design of the Wandler showroom in Amsterdam. \u201cWhen [people] visit we always make sure that [they] will be excited and surprised,\u201d she notes of the rotating vases and objet that decorate their headquarters. \u201cI love to create a Wandler world that is bigger than just accessories,\u201d Wandler adds. \u201cThe design process is similar to a bag or a shoe, because they both have a sculptural aspect, and with this homeware, we\u2019ve created a standalone piece that makes every setting extremely beautiful.\u201d"], "authors": ["Brooke Bobb", "Brooke Bob"], "keywords": ["decor", "pieces", "cabinet", "shoes", "collection", "vases", "designer", "design", "wandler", "accessories", "bags", "wandlers", "amsterdam", "featuring", "sculptural", "inside", "curiosities", "elza"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
