It is unbelievable to us today to think they lived among, and hunted, giant herbivores, some which were the size of a small car.\"", "The paintings were found in the Serran\u00eda La Lindosa, in modern-day Colombia.

While the paintings are exposed to the elements, they are protected by overhanging rock, which means they remain in better condition than other rock art found in the Amazon.", "Some of them were painted so high up on the rock that \"special ladders crafted from forest resources would have been needed\" to create them, according to the press release.", "The people who painted the pictures were hunter-gatherers who ate palm fruit and tree fruits, as well as fishing in the nearby river for piranha and alligators. Bones and plant remains also reveal they ate snakes, frogs, armadillos and rodents, including paca and capybara.", "Researchers on the project are working to find out when humans first settled in the Amazon region, and how their presence affected biodiversity.", "The pre-Columbian rock art at Cerro Azul in Guaviare state, Colombia dates back around 12,000 years.

The pictures show how people would have lived amongst giant, now extinct, animals, which they hunted.\"", "Iriarte was impressed by the realism of the paintings, which were produced during a rare window in which early humans lived alongside megafauna.", "\"The level of observation of the fauna was incredible,\" he said.", "The rock paintings feature in a new TV series, \"Jungle Mystery: Lost Kingdoms of the Amazon,\" on the UK's Channel 4, and the findings are also described in an article in the journal Quaternary International.", "Robinson and Iriarte worked on the project alongside Javier Aceituno of the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia and Gaspar Morcote-Rios of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogota.", "Communities in the local area knew of the rock paintings, and helped researchers document them in the wake of the 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla group, which disarmed after 52 years of conflict.
