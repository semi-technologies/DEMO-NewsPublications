Michael Schmidt, managing director of Gl\u00fcck\u2019s longtime publisher Carcanet, said: \u201cCarcanet started publishing Louise with The Wild Iris back in the 1990s and we have gone on to publish all her collections and her essays. It\u2019s a joy to be able to continue as her publisher now that she is a Nobel laureate. At a time when performance is almost de rigueur, it is possible to see how radical the Nobel committee\u2019s choice is, affirming the primacy of the art in the teeth of the preferences of the age. At Carcanet she has been an inspiration for the last three decades.\u201d", "American Originality, a collection of essays on contemporary poetry that was published in the US in 2017, will be published in the UK in April.

Gl\u00fcck has barely spoken publicly about her win. \u201cMostly I am concerned for the preservation of daily life with people I love,\u201d she told the prize organisers on 8 October, when asked how she felt about winning. \u201cIt\u2019s disruptive. [The phone] is ringing all the time. It\u2019s ringing now.\u201d Speaking to the press outside her house that same day, she said she felt \u201cagitation and joy\u201d before getting in a waiting car. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to wait all day,\u201d she said, before leaving."], "authors": ["Sian Cain"], "keywords": ["carcanet", "louise", "won", "2021", "literature", "collection", "set", "prize", "nobel", "poetry", "publish", "winner", "gl\u00fcck", "published", "essays"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
