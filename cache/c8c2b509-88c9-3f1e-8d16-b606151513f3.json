Mason loves hikers who are a little bit different, a little bit strange. He asked Mostly Harmless if he could take a picture. Mostly Harmless hesitated but then agreed. He then left the shop and went on his way. Two weeks later, Mason heard from a friend in Alabama who had seen Mostly Harmless hiking through a snowstorm. \u201cHe was out there with a smile on his face, walking south,\u201d Mason recalls.", "By the last week of January, he was in northern Florida, walking on the side of Highway 90, when a woman named Kelly Fairbanks pulled over to say hello. Fairbanks is what is known as a \u201ctrail angel,\u201d someone who helps out through-hikers who pass near her, giving them food and access to a shower if they want. She was out looking for a different hiker when she saw Mostly Harmless. She pulled over, and they started to chat. He said that he had started in New York and was heading down to Key West. She asked if he was using the Florida Trail App, and he responded that he didn\u2019t have a phone.", "Fairbanks took notice of his gear\u2014which was a mix of high-end and generic, including his black-and-copper trekking poles. And she was struck by his rugged, lonely look. \u201cHe had very kind eyes. I saw the huge beard first and thought, \u2018It\u2019s an older guy.\u2019 But his eyes were so young, and he didn\u2019t have crow's feet. I realized he was a lot younger.\u201d She was concerned though, the way she used to be concerned about her two younger brothers. The trail could be confusing, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before everything started getting intolerably hot and muggy. \u201cI remembered him because I was worried,\u201d she added.", "Six months later and 600 miles south, on July 23, 2018, two hikers headed out into the Big Cypress National Preserve. The humidity was oppressive, but they trudged forward, crossing swamps, tending aching feet, and dodging the alligators and snakes. About 10 miles into their journey, they stopped to rest their feet at a place called Nobles Camp. There they saw a yellow tent and a pair of boots outside. Something smelled bad, and something seemed off. They called out, then peered through the tent\u2019s windscreen. An emaciated, lifeless body was looking up at them. They called 911.", "\u201cUh, we just found a dead body.\u201d", "It\u2019s usually easy to put a name to a corpse. There\u2019s an ID or a credit card. There\u2019s been a missing persons report in the area. There\u2019s a DNA match. But the investigators in Collier County couldn\u2019t find a thing. Mostly Harmless\u2019 fingerprints didn\u2019t show up in any law enforcement database. He hadn\u2019t served in the military, and his fingerprints didn\u2019t match those of anyone else on file. His DNA didn\u2019t match any in the Department of Justice\u2019s missing person database or in CODIS, the national DNA database run by the FBI. A picture of his face didn\u2019t turn up anything in a facial recognition database. The body had no distinguishing tattoos.", "Nor could investigators understand how or why he died. There were no indications of foul play, and he had more than $3,500 cash in the tent. He had food nearby, but he was hollowed out, weighing just 83 pounds on a 5'8\" frame. Investigators put his age in the vague range between 35 and 50, and they couldn\u2019t point to any abnormalities. The only substances he tested positive for were ibuprofen and an antihistamine. His cause of death, according to the autopsy report, was \u201cundetermined.\u201d He had, in some sense, just wasted away. But why hadn\u2019t he tried to find help? Almost immediately, people compared Mostly Harmless to Chris McCandless, whose story was the subject of Into the Wild. McCandless, though, had been stranded in the Alaska bush, trapped by a raging river as he ran out of food. He died on a school bus, starving, desperate for help, 22 miles of wilderness separating him from a road. Mostly Harmless was just 5 miles from a major highway. He left no note, and there was no evidence that he had spent his last days calling out for help.", "Please feel free to discuss this story, and any possible leads that should be pursued, in the comments below. ( Register here for an account.)", "The investigators were stumped. To find out what had happened, they needed to learn who he was. So the Florida Department of Law Enforcement drew up an image of Mostly Harmless, and the Collier County investigators shared it with the public. In the sketch, his mouth is open wide, and his eyes too. He has a gray and black beard, with a bare patch of skin right below the mouth. His teeth, as noted in the autopsy, are perfect, suggesting he had good dental care as a child. He looks startled but also oddly pleased, as if he\u2019s just seen a clown jump out from behind a curtain. The image started to circulate online along with other pictures from his campsite, including his tent and his hiking poles."], "authors": ["Nicholas Thompson", "Nicholas Thompso"], "keywords": ["nameless", "crack", "started", "didnt", "harmless", "hiker", "miles", "internet", "investigators", "theres", "tent", "mason", "case", "database", "cant", "trail"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
