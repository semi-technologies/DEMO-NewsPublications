There are endless options, from classic satin pumps in ivory or cream, pointed-toe slingbacks decked in lace, or even delicate pearl or diamante embellished heels. The irony is, however, that beneath the long trains, layers of ruching, and floor-length hems of most bridal dresses, the beautiful and carefully selected shoes often end up hidden away.", "Since the modern bride tends to change her wedding look\u2014there\u2019s a dress for the ceremony, reception, and sometimes even the afterparty\u2014these outfit changes can call for new footwear too. Call it revolutionary, or maybe it\u2019s simply an era when practical fashion outweighs tradition, but brides today are swapping out pretty party shoes for something unexpected and much more casual: the wedding sneaker. Whether you\u2019re hiding a pair under your gown, or showing them off with an accompanying afterparty frock, a sneaker can, in fact, be wedding appropriate. Take it from Vogue\u2019s own beauty editor, Jenna Rennert, who swapped a pair of 3-inch bedazzled heels at one in the morning for a pair of custom Nike Blazers, that she matched with her new husband. The two comfortably danced the night away, a major relief after a whole day of running around between wedding festivities\u2014plus, they paired perfectly with her wispy feathered mini dress.", "You don\u2019t have to be a total sneakerhead in order to get behind the look either: These pairs feel just as special as ceremonial bridal shoes, and come complete with grosgrain ribbon laces, crystal-embellished buckles, and glitter-dusted soles. With plenty of things to worry about on your wedding day, a little extra comfort is appreciated; with these on your feet, everything from greeting guests to dancing should all be a piece of cake. Whether your dress has a bustle, or you plan on changing looks completely, consider slipping on a wedding-worthy sneaker; whether its one with a bit of glitz, or a custom keepsake from the day.
