If those politics are any indication, privacy in the post-2020 landscape will be odd, iterative, surprisingly bipartisan, and very complicated.", "California's Prop 24 ratifies the California Privacy Rights Act, the successor to 2018\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act. Conceived as a parallel to Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the CCPA left many privacy advocates unhappy with loopholes that let Facebook, Google, and hordes of anonymous data brokers avoid regulation.", "The CCPA exempted many forms of targeted advertising, essentially permitting the collection and sharing of personal user data without consent\u2014precisely the activity the law was intended to eliminate. CCPA also left enforcement solely to the already overburdened state attorney general, a concession that caused an ongoing rift between two of its authors, Mary Stone Ross and Alastair Mactaggart. (Mactaggart coauthored the CPRA, which Ross opposed.)", "Read More Don't miss the latest Election 2020 news and analysis.", "Companies have many ways of profiting from collecting and accessing our data. Few involve money directly exchanging hands in a sale. The law approved Tuesday targets the companies once able to evade regulation by claiming they \u201cshare\u201d but don't \u201csell\u201d data. CPRA combines the concepts of sharing, selling, and monetizing data. It requires companies to disclose what they\u2019re collecting from users and with whom they\u2019re selling or sharing the data, and it requires them to allow users to opt out of having their data collected, whether or not it's \u201csold\u201d in the literal sense.", "CPRA creates a new category of Sensitive Personal Information (SPI), including race, sexuality, religion, and health data. Businesses must disclose to users if they plan to collect, share, or sell SPI. Once informed, users can prevent companies from sharing SPI. It also allocates $10 million to a new California Privacy Protection Agency that will enforce the law.", "Finally, the language of the 2018 law left the door open for companies to require users to opt out of tracking from each site they visit rather than end tracking with one swoop. CPRA allows users to employ a global opt-out, such as a Do Not Track tool, but also to allow tracking selectively.", "Privacy advocates who oppose CPRA see this as one of many examples of one step forward, two steps backward. Enforcement doesn\u2019t begin until 2023, businesses with less than $25 million in revenue in are exempt, credit reporting giants like Experian and Equifax are exempt from most of its provisions, and companies can still withhold certain perks or discounts from consumers who choose not to share data.", "This last concession is especially contentious. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU of Northern California, staunch privacy defenders for generations, both cited this for why they opposed Prop 24. Both have concerns it could incentivize a \u201cpay for privacy\u201d structure that encourages people to hand over their data for cash and discounts. This could be especially harmful for communities of color, the ACLU argued in an October blog post, because vulnerable users will be compelled to exchange their data for lower prices, while more privileged users can afford to decline. This contradicts the protections brought on by the new SPI distinction.", "CPRA\u2019s biggest supporters, including Consumer Watchdog\u2019s executive director, Carmen Balber, admit the legislation isn\u2019t perfect but evinces a new model for stronger privacy protections.", "If the 2018 law said \u201cdon\u2019t sell my data,\u201d what followed was two years of companies obfuscating the meanings of \u201csell,\u201d \u201cmy,\u201d and \u201cdata.\u201d", "\u201cI would love to win the whole fight in one fell swoop, but that rarely, if ever, happens in the real world,\u201d Balber says, instead noting that the legislation is written specifically to allow for future revisions. \u201cI think that's probably the model we're going to see for [privacy] reform across the country.\u201d"], "authors": ["Sidney Fussell", "Sidney Fussel"], "keywords": ["message", "spi", "sell", "prop", "privacy", "election", "users", "companies", "california", "law", "sharing", "data", "voters", "clear"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
