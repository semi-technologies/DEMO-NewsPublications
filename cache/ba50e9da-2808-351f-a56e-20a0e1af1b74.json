Every year, when we set out for the journey that involves a cross-country flight followed by a three-hour drive literally over the river and through the woods to my in-laws\u2019 home in rural Vermont, I brace myself for the possibility that our idyllic holiday road trip might prominently feature vomit.", "Get the NYT Parenting Newsletter Enter your email Sign Up", "Adults have dealt with their kids\u2019 motion sickness for ages \u2014 at least since 300 A.D., when, according to an article published in the Journal of Neurology, \"cart-sickness\u201d was observed in ancient China. Yet we still don\u2019t know why some children feel fine riding in the way-back (or in a rear-facing car seat) and others can\u2019t stomach it.", "In recent years, NASA has researched preventing motion sickness, since, they\u2019ve estimated, 50 percent of astronauts suffer from it during space travel. The organization\u2019s patented technique for avoiding it involves training astronauts to steady their heart rate and blood pressure while rapidly rotating in a chair for 30 minutes, or as long as they can handle it, for 12 sessions. There are no such proven training methods for children.", "\u201cBottom line: There is no easy way to keep a kid from puking in the car,\u201d said Millard Reschke, Ph.D., chief of NASA Neuroscience. So parents are left to find their own mitigating \u2014 and cleaning \u2014 strategies through trial and error, since what works for one kid may not work for another. Fresh air and Sea-bands, which apply acupressure to the wrist to relieve nausea, have helped my son. When those tricks haven\u2019t worked, this portable upholstery cleaner recommended by Wirecutter and car seat with a machine-washable cover helped my husband and I clean the car. Over time, all three of us have gotten better at spotting early symptoms and taking timely breaks to head off carsickness at the pass.", "To help families find their own techniques, I spoke to several experts \u2014 including a neuroscientist, pediatrician, occupational therapist, pediatric psychologist and a dietitian \u2014 as well as a children\u2019s book reviewer, podcast host and professional auto detailer.
