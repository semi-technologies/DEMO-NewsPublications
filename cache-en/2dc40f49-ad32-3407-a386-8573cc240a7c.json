Pursued for not wearing a face mask, Mr Zecler initially spent 48 hours in detention for violence against the police, and says that during the beating he was called a \u201csale n\u00e8gre (dirty negro)\u201d. On November 30th, four days after a surveillance video of his beating was posted on social media, contradicting the officers\u2019 account, preliminary charges were brought against the three, for intentional violence and the falsification of police records. All have been suspended.", "The episode not only shocked France; President Emmanuel Macron said on social media that it \u201cput us to shame\u201d. It has also prompted an extraordinary U -turn by the government. For the beating took place as a controversial \u201cgeneral security\u201d bill designed to reinforce police powers was going through parliament. Article 24 of the draft law, which was passed by the lower house on November 24th and will next go to the Senate, would forbid the posting or broadcasting of any image that identifies an individual officer during a police operation \u201cwith the manifest aim of physically or psychologically causing them harm\u201d. Had the bill already been on the statute books, it might have made posting the video that exposed Mr Zecler\u2019s ordeal illegal.", "The point of Article 24, according to G\u00e9rald Darmanin, the hard-line interior minister who drafted it (presumably with Mr Macron\u2019s initial approval), is to protect the police from attempts to identify and target individuals, whether physically or on social media. French policemen regularly get online threats. In 2016 a police officer and a police employee were stabbed to death in front of their three-year-old son in Magnanville, a town north-west of Paris. Investigators found a list of names of police officers, among other figures, on the perpetrator\u2019s computer.", "The French media and others worried about press freedom, however, cried foul. An editorial in Le Monde, a newspaper, called Article 24 \u201cpernicious\u201d. Ten deputies from Mr Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche ( LREM ), voted against the bill, and 30 more abstained. On November 28th tens of thousands of people took to the streets of cities across France to protest. Even Macronistes are concerned about the president\u2019s drift to the right on security matters.", "At first, the government tried to defend Article 24. Faced with a groundswell of hostile opinion, however, Mr Macron on November 30th told parliamentarians at a crisis meeting at the Elys\u00e9e Palace to rewrite the article completely. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very glorious way of getting out of the situation,\u201d says Roland Lescure, an LREM deputy. \u201cBut at least it\u2019s clear and quick, and a way of saying \u2018sorry, we got it wrong, let\u2019s go back to the drawing board.\u2019\u201d"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["article", "media", "mr", "violence", "man", "way", "bill", "france", "24", "demitour", "zecler", "uturn", "beating", "black", "does", "social", "filmed"], "pubDate": "2020-12-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
