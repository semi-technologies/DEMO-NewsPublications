More specifically, the movie (which is streaming on Netflix) is not about the assertion, made most strenuously by Pauline Kael in her controversial New Yorker piece \u201cRaising Kane,\u201d that Herman J. Mankiewicz, the veteran screenwriter, wrote the screenplay for \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d by himself and nearly had credit stolen from him by Orson Welles, the movie\u2019s director, producer, star, and credited co-writer. Yes, that saga (which I revisited recently) is included in the film, but it is downplayed to the point of insignificance and near incomprehensibility. Rather, \u201cMank\u201d is about why Mankiewicz wrote \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d\u2014what experiences inspired him to write it and were essential to it, and why he was the only person who could have done so.", "The movie is not a \u201cgotcha\u201d movie, not a parroting of Kael\u2019s argument, but, rather, an astutely probing and pain-filled work of speculative historical psychology\u2014and a vision of Hollywood politics that shines a fervent plus \u00e7a change spotlight on current events. It is a film that left me with a peculiar impression\u2014especially when I viewed it a second time, after brushing up on Mankiewicz\u2019s story\u2014that it is, in some ways, an inert cinematic object, lacking a dramatic spark. But its subject is fascinating, and its view of classic Hollywood is so personal, and passionately conflicted, that what takes place onscreen feels secondary to what it reveals of Fincher\u2019s own directorial psychology\u2014of his view of the business and the art of movies, and of his place in both.", "Like \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d \u201cMank\u201d is a movie built with flashbacks. Its present tense is 1940, when Mank (I\u2019ll call the character Mank, as the film does, to distinguish him from the real-life person)\u2014played by Gary Oldman\u2014is deposited at a house (along with a huge clandestine stash of liquor) in a ranch compound in Victorville, California, about sixty miles from Los Angeles. Mank has been in a car accident and severely broken his leg. He\u2019s in a half-body cast, and will be doing his screenwriting from bed. There with him is Welles\u2019s collaborator John Houseman (Sam Troughton), to bounce ideas off of; a British secretary named Rita Alexander (Lily Collins), to take dictation, type the script, and, as it turns out, to spur him onward with insightful queries and responses; a German nurse named Frieda (Monika Gossmann), to care for Mank\u2019s injuries; and, very occasionally, Welles himself (Tom Burke), who calls and drops by to consult. The mainspring of the cycle of flashbacks is a round of dictation that Mank delivers to Rita: she recognizes that the subject of the script he is formulating is the newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (played by Charles Dance), and her question to Mank\u2014about the actress Marion Davies, Hearst\u2019s (much younger) mistress\u2014prompts a flashback to Mank\u2019s first encounter with the mogul, in 1930.", "The long association between Mank and Hearst (who was born in 1863) forms the core of \u201cMank,\u201d and gives rise to the most dramatically and melodramatically developed scenes in the movie. Their first encounter involves Mank\u2019s visit to San Simeon, Hearst\u2019s virtual duchy along the California coast, where a film shoot is underway\u2014financed by Hearst, supervised by the M-G-M boss Louis B. Mayer (Arliss Howard) and his brilliant young head of production, Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley)\u2014to raise Davies\u2019s professional standing in the industry, as it undergoes a sudden and total shift from silent films to talking pictures. There, Mank impresses Hearst with his celebrated wit and wins himself the first of many invitations to dine at Hearst\u2019s palace, while also landing a job as a screenwriter at M-G-M. What Mank observes, experiences, and endures in subsequent years, both on the job and in his place beside Hearst at his long banquet table, becomes the fodder for what will eventually become the \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d script.", "The fodder, in a word, is politics\u2014and its perverse distortions in mass media, then and, by implication, now. At a 1933 Hearst banquet that\u2019s filled with M-G-M people, the discussion turns to California\u2019s impending gubernatorial race, in which the writer Upton Sinclair is running on an explicitly socialist platform. Mayer, a Republican, speaks with horror of socialism, even as the Depression rages and Roosevelt, newly in office, is just beginning to institute his New Deal policies. Davies tells Mank that, in the Hearst household, Sinclair is an unmentionable (for having written critically about Hearst); when the gubernatorial race heats up, in 1934, after Sinclair wins the Democratic nomination, M-G-M, backed by Hearst, throws its considerable weight behind Sinclair\u2019s Republican opponent. The studio\u2019s principal weapons are its prestige (Mayer was the state chairman of the Republican Party) and, even more important, the cinema itself: M-G-M produced a series of faux radio broadcasts, and then faux newsreels, in which foreign-sounding and bedraggled-looking people endorse Sinclair with ominous language, while stereotypically appealing upright Americans express their fears that socialism will deprive them of their modest homes, livelihoods, and beloved American way of life. Red-baiting wasn\u2019t new, of course, but \u201cMank\u201d presents these fabricated testimonials as the crucial innovation that contributed to Sinclair\u2019s defeat\u2014and that, through byways of collateral damage arising from the studio\u2019s corrupt political advertising, led to Mank\u2019s utter disillusionment and break with Hearst.", "These politically centered scenes, which revolve around the high-society machinations that give rise to Mank\u2019s anger-fuelled writing of \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d are the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of \u201cMank,\u201d and the film\u2019s most dramatically strong and historically resonant parts. They are what Fincher seems to have been most interested in filming; the rest of the movie feels like a backward-assembled domino chain, designed to result in them. Fincher is clearly interested in Mankiewicz\u2019s character, the bright light of acerbic wit and learned insight that was shadowed by alcoholism, gambling, and other forms of recklessness. Yet, rather than observing that character in action, Fincher rummages through published accounts of Mankiewicz\u2019s life (including Richard Meryman\u2019s biography, \u201cMank\u201d) for alluring and revealing details, which he reassembles out of context and chronology, and shoehorns into the movie wherever he can, constructing a clear but simplistic psychological framework.", "It\u2019s worth comparing \u201cMank\u201d to a similar but much better bio-pic by Fincher, \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d about Mark Zuckerberg and his founding of Facebook. The fiction in that film was sufficiently vivid to supplant the reality it was based on\u2014to give it a greater density, specificity, resonance, and interiority than the familiar documented stories of Zuckerberg\u2019s life. In \u201cMank,\u201d by contrast, the fiction falls short\u2014rather than taking over for real-life events, it approximates them, mainly in smaller dimensions. \u201cThe Social Network\u201d creates, whereas \u201cMank\u201d states\u2014and the difference begins with the casting and its inevitable effects. Oldman is a supremely gifted actor, but his performance as Mank is something that he gives to the camera; he doesn\u2019t draw the camera to him. Oldman\u2019s acting is active, in voice, gesture, and facial expression, and when he\u2019s not doing anything he\u2019s not acting at all. In \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d a masterwork of portraiture, Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s expressions as Zuckerberg are as strong in repose as in action, drawing Fincher\u2019s camera gaze in and holding it there until it yields the character\u2019s secrets or comes up against them. \u201cMank\u201d never discovers or even suggests the depth that its protagonist bears when he isn\u2019t flashing witty, or the pathos of what\u2019s trapped in his mind while he works unhappily in Hollywood.", "Filming in black-and-white, with high-styled, high-contrast, heavily striated lighting, Fincher delivers a loving parody of classic Hollywood style\u2014a symbol of the very same classic-Hollywood mythology that the movie\u2019s story, in its revelation of the political depravities beneath the industry\u2019s surfaces and behind its scenes, challenges and debunks. In \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d Fincher cast his directorial gaze unknowingly at the place where fake news and disinformation would wreak new forms of political debauchery. That film is the pentimento discernible beneath the surfaces of \u201cMank\u201d\u2014or, rather, \u201cMank\u201d is a do-over, which confronts the political implications that Fincher overlooked in the earlier film. (In fairness, most people did.) This sense of ongoing conflict, and of Fincher\u2019s personal stake in it, emerges in a virtual aside, a near-throwaway scene that\u2019s nonetheless written as brilliantly as it\u2019s filmed, with swing and verve, and that shows, in a flash, where Fincher\u2019s strongest passion lies. The scene shows Mank at the M-G-M studios in the company of his younger brother Joseph (Tom Pelphrey), then a fledgling screenwriter (and eventually a great director), in the company of Mayer, who has just hired the younger Mankiewicz. In a long tracking shot through the studio corridors, Mayer pugnaciously initiates the new hire in the ways of M-G-M and, in a concluding flourish, addresses his own practice while also (as if in Fincher\u2019s own voice) speaking to the art and the business of movies today. \u201cThis is a business where the buyer gets nothing for his money but a memory,\u201d Mayer says. \u201cWhat he bought still belongs to the man who sold it. That\u2019s the real magic of the movies, and don\u2019t let anybody tell you different.\u201d", "Mayer, in this scene, means something more than copyright. He means that movies aren\u2019t like books: the moviegoer buys only a ticket for a viewing, and the studio controls access to the experience as well as the profit from future viewings. Today, it\u2019s Netflix and other major streaming services that play the role which studios did in the nineteen-thirties and forties: like the studios, streaming services control the spigot of viewing, and, like the studios, the major services are vertically integrated, controlling both the means of production and the means of distribution. Netflix both produced \u201cMank\u201d and is the place where the film will be seen\u2014the company, in effect, owns a thousand-screen multiplex, present in every subscriber\u2019s home. If Fincher, in \u201cMank,\u201d looks so ruefully at the intersection of media power and political power, it\u2019s because, in the age of streaming, the reign of behemoth studios and their monopoly has, in effect, returned."], "authors": ["Richard Brody", "Richard Brod", "Anthony Lan"], "keywords": ["dive", "hearst", "film", "impassioned", "hollywood", "studios", "mayer", "politics", "mgm", "david", "fincher", "reviewed", "mank", "movies", "finchers", "movie"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
