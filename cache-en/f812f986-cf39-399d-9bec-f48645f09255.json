The commander of Britain\u2019s National Cyber Force ( NCF ) is a bespectacled, middle-aged man in a beige blazer\u2014a 20-year veteran of GCHQ , Britain\u2019s signals-intelligence service, whose name the government has asked to keep secret. Unassuming as he may be, his agency, responsible for offensive cyber-operations, now stands at the centre of a sweeping overhaul of British defence capabilities.", "On November 19th Boris Johnson announced the biggest programme of investment in defence since the Thatcher era. The cash, an extra \u00a36.5bn ($8.7bn) during this parliament over previous manifesto plans, reverses nearly a decade of military cuts and cements Britain\u2019s position as the second-largest military spender in NATO , behind America, and the largest in Europe, with a budget of \u00a346.5bn this year. It includes a tilt towards the seas and skies, with more spending on ships, a commitment to send an aircraft-carrier to Asia next year (with American marines aboard) and a Space Command to watch for threats to satellites.", "The central theme, though, is technology. Britain will establish a new agency for artificial intelligence ( AI ). It will invest more in drones and lasers. And it will beef up cyber capabilities. That explains Mr Johnson\u2019s decision to avow the existence of the NCF , which has been quietly hacking away since the spring. The force brings under unified command for the first time personnel from GCHQ , the Ministry of Defence and MI 6 , Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory ( DSTL ). The force is thought to number in the hundreds, with the aim of growing to 3,000 staff over the next decade. Adverts are up online.", "The NCF \u2019s purpose is not to collect intelligence\u2014 GCHQ has done that since its inception\u2014but to make things happen. That could include shutting down the communications of a terrorist group or disabling enemy air defences, but also something as simple as sending a message to dissuade someone from acting.", "Such offensive cyber-activity is increasingly common, though most countries keep quiet about it. Britain broke its own silence in 2013, when Philip Hammond, the defence secretary at the time, said that Britain was building a cyber \u201cstrike\u201d capability. In 2017 Britain acknowledged it was \u201croutinely\u201d using offensive cyber against Islamic State, a terrorist group.", "Acknowledging these offensive cyber campaigns was a cheap way of demonstrating counter-terrorism prowess. Yet these campaigns served a secondary purpose, too. They were low-key shows of force obliquely directed at bigger foes. British officials are wary of discussing operations against Russia or China. But \u201cthe fact you don\u2019t see that we use it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t,\u201d noted Mark Sedwill in October, freshly retired as national security adviser.", "Therein lies some of the appeal. \u201cPolicymakers love offensive cyber, for the same reason that they love special forces and intelligence operations,\u201d says a former senior British official, who worked closely with two prime ministers. \u201cThey are largely covert, can be deployed flexibly and don\u2019t have to be disclosed to or debated in Parliament or the press.\u201d", "Some cyber-operations are dramatic attacks that literally destroy physical equipment. Most are more prosaic. The NCF will probably spend more time tackling online child sexual exploitation and fraud than threatening Russia\u2019s power grid. That a mixture of soldiers and civilians should handle everything from criminality to all-out war is unusual. The NCF \u201chas no equivalent anywhere else in the world\u201d, notes Marcus Willett, GCHQ \u2019s former deputy head, approvingly.", "Yet if the NCF has laid its foundation stones, its intellectual scaffolding remains a work in progress. Ciaran Martin, who retired as head of GCHQ \u2019s defensive arm in August, warns that \u201cin all my operational experience, I saw absolutely nothing to suggest that the existence of Western cyber capabilities, or our willingness to use them, deters attackers.\u201d A former British spy chief agrees. \u201cThe reality is that non-military uses of offensive cyber are massively over-played.\u201d Outside wartime, he says, such operations \u201cwill always be niche and ephemeral, though occasionally useful for sending messages\u201d.", "Mr Martin expresses another concern: that Western cyber-armouries might be raided, with baleful consequences for civilian digital infrastructure. \u201cNo one is likely going to be able to steal a nuclear weapon. No one will accidentally lose or leak a ballistic missile\u2026None of these statements hold true for cyber capabilities.\u201d"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["digital", "gchq", "britain", "british", "defence", "assembles", "spies", "soldiers", "cyber", "britains", "force", "offensive", "intelligence", "ncf"], "pubDate": "2020-12-03T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
