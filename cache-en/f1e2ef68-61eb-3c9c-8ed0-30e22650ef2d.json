The system back home (in the US) treats them unfairly in so many different ways that you can never imagine and they only go through it because they feel like there is no other way,\" he explained.", "He added that his hope is for Senegal to be the go-to tourist destination in Africa as a result of Akon city.", "\"As you are coming from America or Europe, anywhere in the diaspora and you feel that you want to visit Africa, we want Senegal to be your first stop,\" he says.", "Alioune Sarr, the Senegalese tourism minister, cheered Akon's decision to invest in the country at this time when the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the nation's economy.", "\"At a time, in a context where national and international private investment is rare.
