Both consist of genetic material called mRNA encased in a bubble of oily molecules called lipids, although they use different combinations of lipids.", "Dr. Offit said that in both vaccines, the bubbles are coated with a stabilizing molecule called polyethylene glycol that he considered a \u201cleading contender\u201d for triggering an allergic reaction. He stressed that more investigation was needed.", "Pfizer\u2019s trial did not find any serious adverse events caused by the vaccine, although many participants did experience aches, fevers and other side effects. The Alaska reactions were assumed to be related to the vaccine because they occurred so quickly after the shot.", "A Pfizer spokeswoman, Jerica Pitts, said the company did not yet have all of the details of the Alaska situation but was working with local health authorities. The vaccine comes with information warning that medical treatment should be available in case of a rare anaphylactic event, she said. \u201cWe will closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed,\u201d Ms. Pitts said.", "After the workers in Britain fell ill, authorities there warned against giving the vaccines to anyone with a history of severe allergic reactions. They later clarified their concerns, changing the wording from \u201csevere allergic reactions\u201d to specify that the vaccine should not be given to anyone who has ever had an anaphylactic reaction to a food, medicine or vaccine. That type of reaction to a vaccine is \u201cvery rare,\u201d they said.", "Pfizer officials have said the two British people who had the reaction had a history of severe allergies. One, a 49-year-old woman, had a history of egg allergies. The other, a 40-year-old woman, had a history of allergies to several medications. Both carried EpiPen-like devices to inject themselves with epinephrine in case of such a reaction."], "authors": ["Noah Weiland", "Sharon Lafraniere", "Mike Baker", "Katie Thomas"], "keywords": ["called", "vaccines", "reaction", "history", "severe", "health", "receiving", "pfizers", "allergic", "workers", "reactions", "treatment", "woman", "allergies", "vaccine", "alaska", "emergency"], "pubDate": "2020-12-16T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
