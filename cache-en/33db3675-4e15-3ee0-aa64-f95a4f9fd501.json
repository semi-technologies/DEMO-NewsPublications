The pair conceived of a print magazine that would spotlight the work of Black creatives and people of color working within the worlds of fashion, art, and music, and began putting out feelers to their community and planning their first shoots. Then, as the pandemic first began to spread around the world at the beginning of 2020, everything ground to a halt. Undeterred, they continued to produce the magazine remotely, with the name finally coming to them earlier this summer. In the middle of the pandemic and at the height of a new civil rights movement, what else to call it but Justsmile?", "\u201cWe started making this magazine almost a year ago, but when we started throwing around a bunch of names this summer and Bryce suggested Justsmile. It just felt right,\u201d explains Hunter. While the magazine doesn\u2019t shy away from politics and activism, the pair\u2019s intention was also to create a much-needed space for Black joy. \u201cAt the time, everything that we were seeing on the news was just about this uprising in America, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and it was all so heavy to watch every day. I wanted the magazine to be a space where everyone could take a second, and step back from all that, and have it brighten up your day.\u201d"], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["starting", "began", "hunter", "bryce", "summer", "inclusivity", "pandemic", "planning", "started", "day", "point", "justsmile", "magazine", "space"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
