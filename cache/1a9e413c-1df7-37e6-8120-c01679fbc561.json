We\u2019re near the headquarters of Shield AI at an urban training facility that approximates conditions in an Afghan village. The two of us stand, one behind the other, outside several shipping containers welded together\u2014\u201ca multistory house\u201d\u2014as though we are about to make entry across its fatal funnel. A steering-wheel-sized quadcopter rests on my palm. I hold the button on its side as instructed. A green light turns on. The rotors of the quadcopter begin to buzz menacingly as the drone gently lifts off. Brandon opens the door in front of us. With a predatory swiftness, the drone darts inside the house. No human is controlling it.", "In just under 60 seconds, it shoots out the front door and turns toward Brandon, as if recognizing an old friend.", "\u201cThe noise is pretty creepy,\u201d I say, as we listen to the drone humming between open rooms.", "\u201cOur customers tell us the noise frightens people,\u201d answers Brandon, who, with his brother Ryan, runs Shield AI. The customers Brandon refers to are members of US Special Operations Command who have been using Shield\u2019s first product, the Nova quadcopter, and its onboard artificial intelligence, Hivemind, to help clear rooms on missions overseas for the past two years.", "While we stand at the entry of the doorway, Brandon takes a smartphone out of his pocket. On half of his screen is a live videofeed from the Nova as it sweeps through the building, which has been stocked with furniture and dummies. On the other half of his screen is a real-time map of the building\u2019s floor plan that the Nova draws via its onboard sensors, including its camera and lidar. As the drone moves from room to room, Brandon annotates the map, tapping the screen for possible threats\u2014a person here, a weapon there, a suspicious box in the corner. This information can then be passed along to other members of the team as they prepare to make entry. The Nova moves through the building at a rate of 2,000 square feet a minute; in just under 60 seconds, it shoots out the front door and turns toward Brandon, as if recognizing an old friend. Brandon reaches out his hand, allowing the quadcopter to land in his palm. Its rotors shut off automatically. Silence returns. It becomes, for me, a surprisingly emotional moment.", "\u201cThis would have saved a lot of guys\u2019 lives,\u201d I say.", "Brandon nods. \u201cI know.\u201d", "When the Nova was deployed in 2018, it was likely the first time an AI-driven quadcopter of this scale was used in combat. Photograph: John Francis Peters", "Brandon and his brother Ryan grew up in Houston, Seattle, and Orlando. Their father, a Taiwanese immigrant and son of a diplomat, moved around when he was growing up, and he often told them that \u201cbeing born and raised in the United States is like winning the lottery. You should know how lucky you are. Don\u2019t take the opportunities this country gives you for granted.\u201d As a boy, Brandon dreamed of becoming a Navy SEAL. And after high school, he got one of those opportunities his dad had always talked about: an appointment to the US Naval Academy. That led to multiple deployments overseas, including two in Afghanistan. Ryan, meanwhile, went to the University of Florida to study engineering and became a businessman.", "After seven years in the Navy, when he was 29, Brandon left the service, and Ryan started helping him transition to civilian life. \u201cBetween deployments, he never talked much about the war,\u201d Ryan said. It wasn\u2019t until Brandon started applying to business schools that Ryan began to learn the details of his brother\u2019s experiences. \u201cI was prepping him for interviews,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI asked him for an example of a complex work decision he\u2019d had to make. That\u2019s when he started opening up, not only with his stories but with what his friends had gone through \u2026 It was all this stuff I never knew.\u201d"], "authors": ["Elliot Ackerman", "Elliot Ackerma", "Paul Scharre", "Will Knight", "Tom Simonite"], "keywords": ["combat", "brandon", "nova", "turns", "lives", "save", "seal", "entry", "door", "quadcopter", "navy", "quest", "ryan", "screen", "started", "drone"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
