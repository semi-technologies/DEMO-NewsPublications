While this is most prominently on display in battles through the Dynamax and Gigantamax mechanics, players can also challenge powerful giant Pok\u00e9mon in cooperative Max Raid Battles. We spoke with the developers to learn more about these encounters.", "Initially, the Max Raid Battles were called something more generic like \"cooperative battles,\" but following Pok\u00e9mon Go's implementation of co-op raids, the word was entered into the vocabularies of Pok\u00e9mon fans across the globe. \"The initial concept of having cooperative battles against a Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 the raid idea \u2013 came before raids were even implemented in Pok\u00e9mon Go, but we saw Pok\u00e9mon Go implement this raid feature and how popular it was for people to get together in the same space and enjoy these cooperative experiences,\" director Shigeru Ohmori says. \"I think there was some influence like how in Pok\u00e9mon Go, you don\u2019t need to be a hardcore battler to enjoy the raid battles. It\u2019s really easy to invite a friend. We wanted to have that element in Sword and Shield\u2019s raid encounters as well.\"", "While Ohmori likes the idea of not having to be a hardcore battler to enjoy these raid encounters, planning director Kazumasa Iwao cautions that you shouldn't expect to walk right in and take down the highest-ranked beasts. \"I think some of them are going to be pretty difficult,\" Iwao says. \"I think it\u2019s going to have a kind of difficulty we haven\u2019t seen in a lot of main series Pok\u00e9mon games up until now, but there is a wide spread of difficulties even in the Max Raid Battles.\"", "Much like the raids in Pok\u00e9mon Go, Max Raid Battles are represented by a ranking system. In Sword and Shield, they're ranked by stars; the more stars a Max Raid Battle has, the more difficult it is. \"It starts out a little easier, then you can choose the difficulty based on how powerful your Pok\u00e9mon are,\" Iwao says. \"Even for me, a seasoned Pok\u00e9mon player, even if I go with one of the five-star Max Raid Battles, I can definitely run into situations where I\u2019m not able to win.\"", "We'll learn just how difficult these raid encounters can be when Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield launches on Switch November 15.", "For more on the upcoming Switch RPGs, head to our hub by clicking the banner below."]}
