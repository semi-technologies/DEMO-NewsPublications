Goateed and genial, Campisi has stopped by to give me a demo of iBreastExam, a handheld breast-cancer-scanning device that he and fellow med-tech entrepreneur Mihir Shah began developing in 2009 as part of their UE LifeSciences health care start-up. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he announces, removing the innocuous-looking pink-and-white appliance from a brown leather box.", "Resembling a travel-size clothing steamer, the device uses an electronic sensor similar to a smartphone\u2019s touchscreen to detect abnormal breast lumps as small as five millimeters. Cloud-connected and radiation-free, it allows health care workers to perform breast exams anywhere, in minutes, and without a degree in radiology. Over the past three years, iBreastExam\u2014which has a distribution partnership with GE and has attracted research grants as well as venture capital funding\u2014has been deployed in parts of the developing world where mammograms are scarce due to their high cost, a lack of electricity, or a dearth of radiologists (India has just one for every 100,000 people). Its usage has proliferated across Asia, Mexico, and Africa, where it has already screened a quarter-million women\u2014and as of this month, the rollout is under way with gynecologists and primary-care physicians in select U.S. cities. It is poised to be the biggest innovation in early breast-cancer detection since the mammogram was widely introduced in 1963\u2014and the average American doctor has never heard of it.", "Part of that is by design, explains Campisi, who has close relatives who have survived breast cancer. \u201cOur original plan was to fill a huge need specifically in the developing world, as most diagnoses were coming in at a very late stage,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then a light bulb went off.\u201d Why, he and Shah\u2014an adjunct faculty member at Drexel University\u2019s School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems\u2014wondered, shouldn\u2019t they try to get the device approved for use in the United States?", "\u201cA quarter of patients in this country should be getting mammograms and just don\u2019t,\u201d says Brian Englander, M.D., chairman of radiology at Pennsylvania Hospital and an associate professor of clinical radiology at Penn\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine, who has been conducting clinical trials on iBreastExam for more than a year. Fear of radiation and a mistrust of the health care system are often factors. But so-called health care deserts\u2014underserved parts of the country where the closest radiologist might be miles away and insurance coverage may be at an even higher premium\u2014have much to do with it as well.", "\u201cThere is a developing-world demographic in many urban areas of the U.S.,\u201d confirms Campisi. But he also sees enticing promise in serving the demographic that does have access to mammography. He\u2019s promoting the apparatus as a way to document a clinical breast exam\u2014\u201cwhich, if you ask any O.B., is a missing link.\u201d (I ask my own ob-gyn, who agrees\u2014and is eager to hear more about the device.) \u201cIt gives you absolute, retrievable, reproducible data you can compare year to year,\u201d Englander reiterates. \u201cAnd the sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the better the chances of successful treatment.\u201d", "Campisi logs my personal information into an Android phone (the most common platform worldwide), I slip off my kimono, and we get started. On a gray screen, each breast is divided into 16 quadrants; typically, only the middle four need to be measured, but this varies with breast size. He gently presses the padded sensor onto an upper quadrant of my left breast. Capturing data, a screen says. Green indicates no lumps; red means something has been detected. He measures four areas on both breasts. Each, thankfully, glows green. Data recorded. \u201cLooks good,\u201d he says as my husband, unperturbed, wanders into the kitchen for a sandwich. The whole process has taken five minutes.", "While several studies have found iBreastExam\u2019s sensitivity to be on par with a mammogram\u2019s\u2014including a 2016 article published in the World Journal of Surgical Oncology, in which iBreastExam demonstrated a sensitivity rate of 85.7 percent compared with a mammogram\u2019s sensitivity rate of 85\u201388 percent\u2014Campisi is the first to admit that the tool has limitations, one being that unlike mammograms, it can\u2019t pick up microcalcifications: small deposits of calcium that can be an early sign of precancerous cells. \u201cThere is also a concern that people will say, \u2018Well, I got an iBreastExam; I don\u2019t need a mammogram,\u2019 \u201d Englander points out. \u201cBut mammography is proven. So my hope is that if someone does get an iBreastExam, we can say, \u2018Now that you\u2019ve done it and it\u2019s not that bad, let\u2019s have you go for further evaluation.\u2019 \u201d The technology\u2019s potential to determine which women should go on to further testing is promising, agrees Victoria Mango, M.D., an eminent breast radiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, which is conducting additional clinical trials on the device. For those in the trenches, it cannot be overstated how exciting that development is for fighting this disease. Adds Campisi, \u201cWe need all the tools in our arsenal to beat this thing.\u201d"], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Jancee Dunn"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/early-breast-cancer-detection-technology?mbid=social_onsite_pinterest", "keywords": ["cancerdetection", "device", "early", "breast", "lowcost", "campisi", "ibreastexam", "health", "radiationfree", "painless", "care", "clinical", "need", "world", "mammograms"], "summary": "Resembling a travel-size clothing steamer, the device uses an electronic sensor similar to a smartphone\u2019s touchscreen to detect abnormal breast lumps as small as five millimeters.\nCloud-connected and radiation-free, it allows health care workers to perform breast exams anywhere, in minutes, and without a degree in radiology.\nPart of that is by design, explains Campisi, who has close relatives who have survived breast cancer.\nFear of radiation and a mistrust of the health care system are often factors.\nOn a gray screen, each breast is divided into 16 quadrants; typically, only the middle four need to be measured, but this varies with breast size.", "title": "Can Early Breast Cancer-Detection Be Painless, Low-Cost, and Radiation-Free?"}
