The piece is called Untitled (Ich kaufe nichts), meaning \u201cI don\u2019t buy anything\u201d in German. While Taffel and Leccese consider this the perfect sentiment for the year, they\u2019re also excited about some newly released Leorosa gloves\u2014made to cherish, and to be passed down.", "Here, Taffel and Leccese share their favorite holiday traditions and items that make for a festive time at home, wherever you are, because as they say, \u201cwhimsical and fun seem to be what we all need right now.\u201d", "Where were you both born and where do you live now?", "Currently we both live in our home cities\u2014Cologne and New York.

Maybe Christmas parties?", "What is your earliest Christmas memory?", "Paolina: \u201cThe Christmas Bell. It was gold with a black top, and when my father would ring it, it meant that Santa had arrived and the gifts were delivered under the tree.\u201d", "Julian: \u201cWe would always create our own Christmas tree by cutting out the shape from a large piece of green cardstock. From there we would make illustrations, add stickers, and punch holes in for lights and hang ornaments over them.\u201d", "You mentioned on the phone that Leorosa is a lifestyle brand more than a fashion company. Can you explain that?", "We love to discover different ways to create a world beyond our cardigans. For the second collection, we created a magazine that explores our initial idea of uniformity. Through it we were able to work with writers and artists to create something tangible that represents our vision of the brand. It was the first time either of us made a magazine, and it was so much fun. Maybe we will make a second edition for the third collection. Who knows! For the first collection we designed a small temporary shop with lavender walls and blue and yellow velvet curtains. We love imagining a Leorosa world.", "What is on your wishlist?", "Julian: A DVD of the film Poussi\u00e8res d'amour by Werner Schroeter, 1996", "Paolina: Hoffmann Heinrich: Der Struwwelpeter.
