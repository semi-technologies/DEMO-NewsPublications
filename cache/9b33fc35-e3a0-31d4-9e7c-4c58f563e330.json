For a lot of people, that can just be a good cup of coffee; they develop routines around when to get it, find favorite cafes that cater to their style, and get to know the baristas who are serving their beverage of choice. Toge Productions taps into this concept in Coffee Talk, an interactive experience that shows the powerful relationships that can form around a cuppa joe. While this theme makes for some engaging conversations, the writing falls into a tangle of clich\u00e9s that go exactly where you expect.", "Coffee Talk is set in Seattle in 2020, but isn\u2019t exactly a representation of the real world. In this alternate reality, creatures like werewolves, vampires, and succubi coexist with humans. Elves are building startups, dwarves are creating automotive empires, and orcs are using computers instead of axes for job satisfaction. You play as the owner and barista of a small coffee shop \u2013 one of the few open past midnight. Your job? Fulfill patrons\u2019 drink requests and listen to their troubles.", "It\u2019s important to go into Coffee Talk knowing that it tells an authored story; it\u2019s a visual novel first and foremost. This isn\u2019t a game of choice, and it has no dialogue options. The only control you have to how events sometimes play out is by correctly fulfilling drink orders. For instance, if you find a special concoction, you may be able to help a werewolf contain his rage. The game is more about capturing the relationships that form between a barista and their customers. Many times you\u2019re just watching interactions play out between other customers who have also formed companionships due to their shared interest in late-night coffee.", "For such a text-heavy game, the dialogue is well done, albeit with a few grammatical errors. I especially liked the banter between everyone. It isn\u2019t all fun and games, though. Coffee Talk gets creative and uses its characters to explore various issues in society, from racism to crunch. Sometimes the writing waxes philosophical. For example, it discusses how even if the world was one race, we\u2019d still find some differences among us and use them to marginalize others.", "I like that Coffee Talk poses these questions, but it does so in predictable, well-worn ways. You have an elf and succubus whose parents want them to marry within their species. A father struggles to let his daughter make her own mistakes, while the daughter can\u2019t seem to grasp how little life experience she has. These scenarios feel too familiar, and they unfold without many surprises. The most interesting storyline centers on Neil, a mysterious being from another planet who is merely looking to breed and enters the world of dating apps. If anything, Coffee Talk feels like a game full of interesting concepts that are only half-realized. I was more entertained with the ideas than their execution.", "When you\u2019re not chatting up customers, you\u2019re creating their requested drinks, and this is really the only way you can show people you\u2019ve been listening to them. Sometimes, customers say, \u201cMake my usual.\u201d Other times, they say, \u201cSurprise me.\u201d Sometimes they make requests you can\u2019t fulfill exactly, forcing you to improvise. A lot of the later game drink requests require experimentation, and sometimes you\u2019re just fumbling in the dark. At the very least, you can trash a drink up to five times before serving it, and the loading menus sometimes provide hints at how to create the fancier coffees.", "The specificity required to make some drinks is frustrating. For instance, you get one primary ingredient and two secondary ones. The order that you put the secondary ingredients can alter the drink you\u2019re making. You can have all the right ingredients, but still endure some trial-and-error to craft what you want. And the controls (on PS4, at least) make creating latte art more trouble than it\u2019s worth, to the point where I had to stop bothering with it. Outside of these annoyances, I had fun trying to unlock all the different drink types.", "Coffee Talk is an interesting experience. At times, it struggles with just how far it wants to explore certain topics, sometimes only giving a cursory look at the issue at hand. I was still entertained during my playthrough, and I genuinely cared about the characters and their journeys \u2013 even if those journeys don\u2019t take them to unexpected places."], "authors": ["Features Editor", "Kimberley Is Usually Playing The Latest Rpg", "Sports Title", "Or Narrative-Driven Experience.
