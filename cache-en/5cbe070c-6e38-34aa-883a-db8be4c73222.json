On Tuesday, the Guardian revealed a group of eight former players are proposing to take legal action over the issue.", "The group, including England\u2019s 2003 Rugby World Cup winning hooker Steve Thompson, are set to contact World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU over what they claim is their failure to protect them from the risks caused by concussions.", "In an interview with the How To Academy and reported in the Times, Jones said: \u201cFirstly it is very sad news but I think if there is a positive about it \u2013 and there is never a positive about people being sick or losing part of their function \u2013 it is that the game has adjusted to it. I don\u2019t think that the game at the moment is unsafe. If you look at most sports back then it was unsafe.\u201d", "Would @EnglandRugby coach Eddie Jones #taketheknee?

Can we make it safer? Can we make it better for the players? We have just to keep doing it.\u201d", "Jones\u2019s comments are likely to prove controversial. Player safety has improved in some respects, for instance the adoption into rugby\u2019s laws of the head injury assessment (HIA) in 2015, which allows for a temporary substitution to be made while a player with suspected concussion is assessed.", "But as many players are now finding, the cumulative effects of thousands of collisions over the course of their careers will only become clear in retirement \u2013 and the forces of the impacts involved in an increasingly power-based game only seem to increase.", "Asked about physical toll on players, Jones said: \u201cWhat we try to do is make sure the training is appropriate for the game. We try to make sure they have every opportunity to recover properly \u2026 At the end of the day, the players make a choice to play the game. No one is forcing them. We know there are demands on the body because it is a physically demanding game. We have made really good progress in making the game safe and the players have the choice about whether to play or not.\u201d"], "authors": ["Luke Mclaughlin"], "keywords": ["academy", "world", "coach", "rugby", "england", "past", "eddie", "try", "game", "jones", "learned", "think", "players", "safe", "sure", "player"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
