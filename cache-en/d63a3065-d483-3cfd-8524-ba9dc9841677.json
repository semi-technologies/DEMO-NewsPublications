Not just about the game, but about her beliefs. At the U.S. Open this year, she wore masks emblazoned with the names of Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Philando Castile, Tamir Rice, and George Floyd, all Black victims of police violence. She understands that fashion is a tool for communicating, but she also sees it as an outlet for creative self-expression. In fact, she\u2019s been sketching her own designs with her sister since they were little kids, and now, after creating a capsule line for the Japanese label ADEAM, she\u2019s collaborated on a new accessories offering.", "Today Osaka and the Scottish accessories label Strathberry are unveiling a limited-edition collection of five bag styles and two wallets. The minimalist, sculptural designs come in subtle hues and pops of color, and feature Strathberry\u2019s signature metal bar hardware as well as a leather-wrapped handle, which nods to the grip on a tennis racket. To mark the collaboration and further support Osaka\u2019s causes, Strathberry will be making a donation to her recently launched organization Play Academy, which helps change the lives of young girls through play and sport.", "Photo: AB+DM Studio/Styled by Law Roach", "\u201cI want to really empower women to claim their moment every time they step out with one of these bags on their shoulder,\u201d says Osaka, who notes that the bags were designed to be \u201cunique, versatile, and fun.\u201d Strathberry cofounder Leeanne Hundleby echoes Osaka\u2019s intentions: \u201cNaomi is the embodiment of a role model who has inspired young men and women everywhere with her unrelenting drive, confidence, and voice.\u201d", "In addition to winning tennis championships and fighting for social justice, Osaka hopes to pursue other projects within the fashion industry. \u201cFashion and design are such creative outlets for me, and it\u2019s become my favorite way to express myself, which is why it\u2019s such a liberating experience when I collaborate with brands,\u201d she says. \u201cMixing and matching and finding what works together is so fun and cool. I love to push the limits.\u201d"], "authors": ["Brooke Bobb", "Brooke Bob"], "keywords": ["express", "favorite", "osakas", "way", "shes", "play", "young", "osaka", "strathberry", "line", "naomi", "fashion", "women", "tennis", "bag"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
