It is bursting with wonderful moments of unguarded intimacy between three Irish women who are stuck on a hospital ward together. Funny, sad and absolutely irrepressible all at the same time. The Lamplighter (Picador, \u00a39.99) by Jackie Kay is a heartbreaking portrait of four enslaved women. It\u2019s a beautiful work that you will feel deeply, but it will also help the reader reconsider Britain\u2019s hidden history in the slave trade. Who They Was by Gabriel Krauze (Fourth Estate, \u00a314.99) is a wild ride from the very first page. An astonishing telling of a young man\u2019s search for belonging, caught between a life of crime with his London gang and hopes for his academic future.", "Ali Smith", "Author of Summer, the last in her series of seasonal books", "Margaret Atwood has always been a poet; her poetry collections make visible the taproot of the wry, wise metaphysic that runs through her fiction and essays, and in a precarious time her new collection, Dearly (Chatto and Windus, \u00a314.99), is a source of uncompromising elemental warmth. David Diop\u2019s At Night All Blood Is Black (Pushkin, \u00a314.99), a novel translated from the French by Anna Moschovakis, deals with a very untold story, the Senegalese soldiers who fought for France in the first world war trenches, and is so incantatory and visceral I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget it. And right now I\u2019m in the middle of Red Comet by Heather Clark (Jonathan Cape, \u00a330), surely the final, the definitive, biography of Sylvia Plath, a book whose 1,000-plus-page breadth on the one hand is so literally weighty that reading it means you have to develop new muscles, and on the other hand takes its time in desensationalising the life and the art; this lets Clark place both firmly in the literary and politically engaged contexts that formed them and simultaneously demonstrate how Plath\u2019s work, in return, gifted the writing life unimaginable new sinew.", "Anne Applebaum", "Journalist and author of Twilight of Democracy", "Composite: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian, PR images", "What is a nation?

That\u2019s a question that gets asked a lot right now in America and in Britain; Roderick Beaton\u2019s Greece: Biography of a Modern Nation (Allen Lane, \u00a312.99) is an extended attempt to answer it for modern Greece. It isn\u2019t just a narrative history, but rather a history of Greekness: the battles and arguments about the nature of a nation that was reinvented at the beginning of the 19th century. That same question lies at the heart of another extraordinary history book, Camilla Townsend\u2019s Fifth Sun (Oxford University Press, \u00a319.99), a new history of the Aztecs based not on the accounts written by the Spanish, but on previously obscure, Nahuatl-language sources. Townsend explores not just Aztec culture but also Aztec identity, showing how strong it remained for many generations after the conquest. Finally, Catherine Belton\u2019s Putin\u2019s People (William Collins, \u00a325) tells the parallel story of Vladimir Putin and the young KGB officers whose drive to take power in Russia transformed what might have become a very different kind of country into a post-Soviet autocracy. Belton explains how this deeply cynical elite used its contacts in the offshore, dark money world, created in the 1980s and 1990s, not only to become wealthy but to insulate and protect themselves from the new Russia they created.", "Carlo Rovelli", "Physicist and author of There Are Places in the World Where Rules Are Less Important Than Kindness", "Most of what I read this year was published in the past. Quite often in the far past: I love reading classics, both in literature and among books of ideas. But The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) (Allen Lane, \u00a320) by Katie Mack is one new book that stood out for me this year. When we think about our own life, we commonly worry more about the end than the beginning. For the whole universe, instead, we mostly hear inquiries about its beginnings. What about its end? How will the universe end up? We are not sure about the answer, of course, but there are a number of concrete possibilities that science is currently exploring. Katie Mack gives us an overview. She is a great scientist, a passionate inquirer of nature, a great companion in this exploration, full of wit and lightness. I have learned from her plenty of things I did not know.

Evans is blessed with perfect pitch when it comes to dialogue \u2013 both in terms of what is spoken and what goes unsaid. The First Woman (Oneworld, \u00a316.99) by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi is the feminist coming-of-age story we\u2019ve been waiting for. With the timeless quality of a story shared from lips to ears, this novel is a page-turner and a mind-blower. As for Hamnet (Tinder Press, \u00a320) by Maggie O\u2019Farrell, could there possibly be a better time to read a novel about a plague? This is not an easy read, but 2020 hasn\u2019t been an easy year.

An extraordinary story about two Jewish sisters, Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, friends of Anne Frank, in occupied Netherlands during the second world war. A story of resistance and collaboration, of bravery and betrayal. I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head for days. The Weirdest People in the World (Allen Lane, \u00a330) by the evolutionary biologist Joseph Henrich is an incredibly ambitious book. Henrich shows why the discipline that we call \u201cpsychology\u201d is not the study of human nature, but the study of people who are \u201cwestern, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic\u201d \u2013 in other words: weird. It\u2019s been a long time since I learned so much from one book as I learned from Why We\u2019re Polarized (Profile, \u00a314.99) by Ezra Klein. He shows just how broken the American political system is. There have been so many titles about the question \u201cWhy Trump?\u201d and this one succeeds where most of the others fail.", "Ed Caesar", "Journalist and author of The Moth and the Mountain: A True Story of Love, War and Everest", "Mayflies (Faber, \u00a314.99) by Andrew O\u2019Hagan is a gorgeous novel, full of crisp and evocative images. It concerns the love between two best friends. It begins in lustful youth, with a pilgrimage by a group of Glasgow boys to Manchester in the mid-1980s to see Morrissey and visit the Ha\u00e7ienda. It concludes with the same characters in middle age, confronting a crisis. Notes from an Apocalypse (Granta, \u00a314.99), Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s picaresque attempt to understand his preoccupation with the end of the world, was published just as the pandemic was reordering life on the planet so the timing was auspicious. But even had the world not been ending, or seeming to end, Notes from an Apocalypse would have resonated. It is both wildly funny and oddly moving. This Is Chance! (Random House, $28) by Jon Mooallem, an account of a massive earthquake that shook Alaska in 1964, and a remarkable radio journalist named Genie Chance who broadcast to the frightened citizens of Anchorage, is strange and beautiful. I have pressed it on many people this year. Aside from its gripping central story, Mooallem plays with the rules of nonfiction in fascinating ways.", "Olivia Laing", "Critic and author of Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency", "Composite: Suki Dhanda, PR images", "In lieu of galleries, I\u2019ve been bingeing on exhibition catalogues and Michael Clark: Cosmic Dancer (Prestel/Barbican, \u00a335) from the Barbican is a peach. It reminds me of everything we\u2019re missing: bodies in close proximity, nightlife, dressing up, exuberance and joy. I also love Philip Guston: Now, the catalogue for the controversially postponed retrospective that was supposed to open at the Tate next spring. Guston refused to turn a blind eye to white supremacy, and it\u2019s appalling that his Klan paintings have been deemed unsuitable. The best essay is by Mark Godfrey, the curator suspended for protesting against the decision. There\u2019s more brilliant writing in Suppose a Sentence (Fitzcarraldo Editions, \u00a310.99) by Brian Dillon, a book about beguiling sentences from Shakespeare and Thomas Browne to Virginia Woolf and Anne Carson.

I bristled at first sight of Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet (Tinder Press, \u00a320); I usually avoid novels about historical figures and their families. But 50 pages in, I was weeping for the young Hamnet Shakespeare and didn\u2019t care who his father was. An exquisite, sensorily alive study of childhood and parenthood in the Tudor age or any age, this richly deserved its Women\u2019s prize for fiction. Roddy Doyle\u2019s plainly titled Love (Jonathan Cape, \u00a318.99) drew me in gently and moved me deeply as his old friends open up to each other over one long pub crawl. On this side of the pandemic, I read it as a hymn to the small but irreplaceable pleasures of face-to-face chat in public places.", "Lionel Shriver", "Author of The Motion of the Body Through Space", "Once more, Lawrence Osborne did not disappoint in his atmospheric thriller The Glass Kingdom (Hogarth, \u00a316.99), set in Bangkok.

Thomson\u2019s sharply portrayed and predominantly Asian cast in Saigon argues well against any \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d taboo; writers own whatever they can grasp and describe with skill. And I confess for slightly lighter fare I was also engaged by The Weekend (Orion, \u00a314.99) by Charlotte Wood. If nothing else, it was refreshing to encounter a novel that so profoundly sympathises with women on the forbidding cusp of being classified as \u201celderly\u201d. Wood ably conveys that older women didn\u2019t used to be old, and that the experience of ageing is universally bewildering.", "Sarah Moss", "Author of Summerwater", "Composite: Patrick Bolger/The Observer, PR images", "Much-needed cause for celebration: Kathleen Jamie\u2019s new essay collection, Surfacing (Sort of Books, \u00a39.99), which lived at my bedside for rereading for months. She has the rare ability to see harm done to the natural world and to small communities and still to write with wonder as well as precision, and to write better landscapes than anyone else. I read Kawai Strong Washburn\u2019s Sharks in the Time of Saviours (Canongate, \u00a316.99) in the first lockdown and was glad to be both transported to Hawaii and invited to think properly about tradition and ambition; it\u2019s about siblings growing up poor and clever, pulled both by the legends and skills of the pre-industrial past and by their longing for success in contemporary America. The writing is so good I forgot my usual resistance to elements of fantasy. I loved Jenny Offill\u2019s Weather (Granta, \u00a38.99) and Lily King\u2019s Writers & Lovers (Macmillan, \u00a314.99), both darkly funny and clever novels about women surviving Trump\u2019s America (there\u2019s a new genre forming there).", "Daisy Johnson", "Author of Sisters", "Composite: Antonio Olmos/The Observer, PR images", "Little Eyes (Oneworld, \u00a314.99) by Samanta Schweblin, translated by Megan McDowell, is a chilling and often hilarious book on the pitfalls of living in a highly interconnected world. Schweblin has a true talent for getting to the centre of our fears and drawing them out. An intensely clever title that will have you examining your own relationship to the internet. I Am Not Your Baby Mother (Quercus, \u00a316.99) by Candice Brathwaite is an enormously important book about motherhood and the systemic racism inherent in the UK when it comes to pregnancy, birth and raising children. Compellingly written, it\u2019s alive with a fury it is impossible not to feel when reading. Tiffany McDaniel\u2019s Betty (Orion, \u00a314.99) is a brilliant, expansive exploration of family and grief. An innovative coming-of-age story filled with magic in language and plot, it is beautiful and devastating. McDaniel continues to be someone to watch.", "Natalie Haynes", "Broadcaster and author of Pandora\u2019s Jar", "Shadi Bartsch\u2019s new translation of Virgil\u2019s The Aeneid (Profile, \u00a316) is terrific (and a gorgeous physical book, too) \u2013 fresh and pacy. Bartsch walks the tightrope between maintaining the grandeur of the original and making the poem accessible to modern readers and makes it look easy. The Aeneid is the great refugee narrative of its own time, and it should be for our time too. I am obsessed with Thebes, the home of Cadmus, Oedipus and Antigone. So Paul Cartledge\u2019s Thebes: The Forgotten City of Ancient Greece (Macmillan, \u00a325) is exactly the book for me. Academic books are often a bit dry, but this study of the city \u2013 its myth and its history \u2013 is anything but dusty. Religion, war and myth are all interrogated with equal rigour. Don\u2019t tell me Thomas Cromwell wasn\u2019t as beautiful and nuanced as Hilary Mantel makes him in The Mirror & the Light (HarperCollins, \u00a325): I don\u2019t want to know, I want to maintain the fantasy. As a sustained act of world-building, time travel and mind-reading, I\u2019m not sure her Cromwell trilogy will ever be equalled. At the beginning of the first lockdown it was honestly more consoling than food.", "Tana French", "Author of The Searcher", "Composite: Jessica Ryan, PR images", "The Lost Family (Abrams Press, $27) by Libby Copeland is a fascinating exploration of the mysteries ignited by genealogy testing. For Copeland\u2019s \u201cseekers\u201d, \u201cwho am I?\u201d is a more crucial question than any novel\u2019s \u201cwhodunnit?\u201d She weaves together individual stories to make a book that\u2019s both gripping and thought-provoking. In The Hidden Things (Simon & Schuster, \u00a311.99) by Jamie Mason, 14-year-old Carly fights off an attacker in her home and the home security video goes viral. But there\u2019s something in the footage that shouldn\u2019t be there: an old master painting, stolen years earlier in an art theft that went wrong. This is at once an art heist novel, a domestic noir, and an off-kilter coming-of-age story: a smart, startling, vivid book. Ruth Ware\u2019s One By One (Harvill Secker, \u00a312.99) is set in an upmarket ski resort, where the directors and shareholders of hot music app Snoop have gathered to decide the company\u2019s future. Tensions are high, alliances are being forged and broken \u2013 and then the chalet is cut off by an avalanche, then people start to die.

At least, that\u2019s what I thought before I read Isabel Wilkerson\u2019s Caste: The Lies That Divide Us (Allen Lane, \u00a320). It is an extraordinarily authentic expos\u00e9 that uncovers how discrimination, domination and dehumanisation is paralysingly normalised, violently exercised and psychologically ingrained. Lionel Barber offers a scathing yet humorous portrait of power in The Powerful and the Damned (Ebury, \u00a325). The most surprising revelation among his diary entries was the level of disenchantment he expressly holds for our decaying economic system and democracy. And Patrick Vernon and Angelina Osborne\u2019s 100 Great Black Britons (Hachette, \u00a319.99) is an empowering read. For many in Britain, people of African and Caribbean descent in this country have been reduced to three words: the Windrush scandal. It\u2019s refreshing, then, to see somebody celebrate the role that black Britons have played in this island\u2019s long and complicated history.", "Jonathan Coe", "Author of Mr Wilder & Me", "Two of the novels I enjoyed most this year pushed hard at generic boundaries, walking a giddy line between realism on the one hand, and fantasy or the uncanny on the other. In her debut novel, Love and Other Thought Experiments (Corsair, \u00a38.99), Sophie Ward paints a tender and compelling portrait of an ordinary relationship but then pushes the story in increasingly quirky directions: the result is a challenging, intellectually provocative but strangely moving novel. M John Harrison deservedly won the Goldsmiths prize for The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again (Gollancz, \u00a320), his eerie but deadly accurate portrait of modern Britain, written in seamless, accomplished prose \u2013 the prose of a master \u2013 and with the Severn river as one of its central characters. A more conventional but very enjoyable novel was Joanna Briscoe\u2019s The Seduction (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99): a typically probing, sometimes uncomfortable, always gripping study of erotic obsession (Briscoe\u2019s speciality) from one of our most underrated authors.", "Adam Kay", "Author of Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas", "Composite: Andy Hall/The Observer, PR images", "Mark Watson always manages to find the perfect balance of humour and heart. In Contacts (HarperCollins, \u00a314.99), we begin with an ending, as our hero texts all 158 of his phone contacts to tell them he plans to end his life the next morning. It\u2019s an intelligent, poignant book, about connection, isolation and the double edge of technology. Coming out is different for everyone, but it\u2019s a bit of a pain, really \u2013 thank goodness I don\u2019t have to do that again (except every time I meet someone new). In The Magnificent Sons (Little, Brown, \u00a316.99), Justin Myers ensures his very modern coming out story is warm, witty and moving, with some blistering one-liners. Finally, I was gripped by This Lovely City (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99) by Louise Hare. This novel is not just twisty and compelling; it\u2019s an honest and, at times, brutal exploration of the prejudices that continue to haunt the lives of many. The writing is wonderful; London\u2019s energy runs right though it; the characters leap off the page. I was truly sad to leave them behind.", "Yiyun Li", "Author of Must I Go", "Composite: Princeton University, PR images", "The books I most enjoyed this year were A Saint from Texas (Bloomsbury, \u00a318.99) by Edmund White, How Much of These Hills Is Gold (Virago, \u00a314.99) by C Pam Zhang, and Cleanness (Macmillan, \u00a314.99) by Garth Greenwell. They are writers at different stages of their careers, but the books share a vigour that I admire. Life stories of twin sisters from Texas, a retelling of the American west from the angle of Chinese immigrants, and a young man\u2019s making and remaking of himself \u2013 these novels, not hankering after being books of this particular time, offer readers the beauty of language, the intricacies and intensity of human emotions, and a sense of timelessness. They each make a vast world in which the imagination soars.", "Anne Enright", "Author of Actress", "Poet Doireann Ni Ghr\u00edofa is getting all the love this year from readers in Ireland. She has put her entire self into A Ghost in the Throat (Tramp Press, \u00a312.99), a book of nonfiction in which she describes what it is to be alive at this time, in this body, and in thrall to a poem that was written by another woman, in 1773. Believe me, much easier to read than to describe. The Art of the Glimpse (Head of Zeus, \u00a325), edited by Sinead Gleeson, is a substantial volume: a lucky dip of Irish short stories that gives the canon a terrific shake. Mark O\u2019Connell wrote the first good thing I read after the pandemic hit. It was just a short newspaper column but it cut through the dread and I was so drawn by it, I picked up his Notes from an Apocalypse (Granta, \u00a314.99), which manages the same trick. It should be depressing, but isn\u2019t.

Particularly admirable is Otele\u2019s command of the subtleties of identity formation and change over time, as well as her marvellous cast of women characters, such as Jeanne Duval, Baudelaire\u2019s muse and lover. I also learned much from Vincent Brown\u2019s Tacky\u2019s Revolt (Harvard, \u00a328.95), a gripping study of a seminal uprising by enslaved west Africans in Jamaica in the early 1760s, which paved the way for many later revolutions. It highlights the sophistication of the revolutionaries, who were aspiring to create a new state, as well as the valour of the combatants, including women fighters such as Akua, the \u201cQueen of Kingston\u201d, who led a rebel group while adorned with a crown on her head. And I salute Peniel E Joseph\u2019s The Sword and the Shield (Basic Books, $30), a brilliant revisionist study of the lives of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.

Written in wise, unflinching, exquisite prose, this is a different kind of journey \u2013 into the past, into grief and also into Winn\u2019s search for connection. A spiritual journey instead of a physical one, and, for me at least, an even richer one. A new novel by Donal Ryan is always something to be excited about and Strange Flowers (Transworld, \u00a312.99) is no exception. This is a sublime book \u2013 breathtaking in its scope and its lyricism \u2013 about loss, identity and the power of love. Love After Love (Faber, \u00a314.99) by Ingrid Persaud is a vibrant, brave novel about an unconventional family unit in Trinidad.

When in Paris, Jules Renard used to mix in a similar milieu, a century earlier. His freshly translated Journal: 1897-1910 (Riverrun, \u00a320) contains snappy, funny portraits of Toulouse-Lautrec, Rodin, Zola and Sarah Bernhardt.

Claire Messud\u2019s essays in Kant\u2019s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write (Little, Brown, \u00a314.99) are generous visions of the world, informed by her razor-sharp intellect and uncompromising honesty.

And the Booker-shortlisted Real Life (Daunt, \u00a39.99) by Brandon Taylor centres on Wallace, a science graduate student in the American midwest, as he navigates his academic responsibilities and social and romantic ambivalence over the course of a spring weekend. I\u2019m so grateful to these writers for allowing me to experience the sad, funny yearnings, disappointments, and occasional triumphs of other people.", "Caleb Femi", "Poet and author of Poor", "Composite: PR images", "In a year of turmoil and uncertainty, how vital have books been to keep us steadfast, offer us respite and even provide new perspectives beyond the walls that most of us were confined in. Three magicians of the page have gifted the world (me) with fascinating depictions of the human experiences. Will Harris\u2019s Rendang (Granta, \u00a310.99) took me on a lyrical journey from West Sumatra to King\u2019s Cross to the fictional planet Mongo \u2013 his poems are graceful and, at times, devastating. Bolu Babalola\u2019s Love in Colour (Headline, \u00a316.99) charts the technicoloured nuances of love through its reimagining of romantic tales of old. The book\u2019s craft is beautiful and its humour is poised. A real treat by the debut author. Inua Ellams\u2019s The Actual (Penned in the Margins, \u00a39.99) is a heavy-hitting collection that is audacious and unrelenting in its topical preoccupation. Ellams is surgical in his writing and will leave you breathless.", "Rachel Clarke", "Palliative care doctor and author of Dear Life", "Composite: Daniel Lucas, PR images", "In a year of lockdown, listlessness and crippling anxieties, Helen Macdonald\u2019s Vesper Flights (Vintage, \u00a316.99) is writing as lifeline, as salvation. Her essays on swifts, flying ants, peregrines and more helped me shed my fears, escape, take to the air and soar. A read that\u2019s both solace and sheer exhilaration. Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet (Tinder Press, \u00a320) is more painful to read, yet achingly beautiful. Her depiction of a mother\u2019s anguish while watching her beloved Hamnet \u2013 Shakespeare\u2019s son \u2013 succumb to the bubonic plague is vivid and tender. No one who stood on their doorstep applauding key workers this year could be unmoved by Madeleine Bunting\u2019s Labours of Love: The Crisis of Care (Granta, \u00a320). Her interviews capture the elusive blend of attentiveness, compassion and kindness that we know, intuitively, is the essence of care. Caring is what makes us human, Bunting argues. Quite so. The message of 2020 right there.", "Tom Bower", "Author of Boris Johnson: The Gambler", "Graham Greene\u2019s genius to set moral conundrums within a gripping, emotional narrative remains unsurpassed. Since his plots were drawn from his extraordinary life, I was enthralled by Richard Greene\u2019s Russian Roulette: the Life and Times of Graham Greene (Little, Brown, \u00a325). As the son of a Czech refugee, I found When Time Stopped by Ariana Neuman (Simon & Schuster, \u00a316.99) compelling. During her Czech father\u2019s lifetime, Neuman was unaware that she was the child of a Holocaust survivor. Only after his death did she embark on a journey to discover the truth about the epitome of success who woke up at night screaming in a language she did not understand. Charles Spencer\u2019s two excellent books about the hunt for Charles I\u2019s executors encouraged me to read The White Ship (HarperCollins, \u00a325). Despite poor editing, the catastrophe of Henry I\u2019s reign in 1120 is fascinating, especially for those unaware of Norman history.", "Naoise Dolan", "Author of Exciting Times", "Composite: Sophia Evans/The Observer, PR images", "This year I produced a lot of new work that I had to decide when to set. (Do people want face masks in everything? Given the mixed real-life appetite, I suspect not.) Ali Smith\u2019s Summer (Penguin, \u00a316.99) navigates timeliness in ways that have helped me profoundly: she considers the pandemic less for its short-term gimmicks than as a lens on core inequalities. I was excited to see Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s short fiction collected in Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99), including \u201clost\u201d Harlem work. Fluid, polymathic voice; what a class act. I thought of my home town, Dublin, while reading Pablo Sendra and Richard Sennett\u2019s Designing Disorder: Experiments and Disruptions in the City (Verso, \u00a314.99). Dublin is often tall but rarely open: the medieval builders kept most things to horse-width. Here, the authors explore ethical urban design in an age of privatisation, hostile architecture and widespread surveillance.", "Avni Doshi", "Author of Burnt Sugar", "Composite: Sharon Haridas, PR images", "Hurricane Season (Fitzcarraldo Editions, \u00a312.99) is a sprawling, heaving thing, and I loved it because I have no idea how Fernanda Melchor was able to write it. The prose has the quality of a storm. Each chapter follows a different character, drawing links between disparate events, expanding the chain of violence. I had been waiting for years for Jenny Offill\u2019s next novel and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. As usual, she pinpoints a series of emotions and ideas before I know I\u2019m feeling them or have the words to articulate them. In Weather (Granta, \u00a38.99) she creates a looming sense of dread, one that invades the otherwise normal lives of her characters. In Blue Ticket (Penguin, \u00a312.99) Sophie Mackintosh poses a question: what if procreating isn\u2019t a choice? The question reverberates from the political into the existential, a sensation that rings true for me personally. While pregnant, I raced through this beautiful and menacing novel over the course of a day and I was haunted by it for weeks after.", "Rachel Long", "Poet and author of My Darling from the Lions", "Composite: Getty Images, PR images", "I know I\u2019m in love when I text my most bookish friend to say: \u201cMy gosh, have you read\u2026 yet?\u201d The last book in our chat is Cannibal by Safiya Sinclair (Picador, \u00a310.99), a collection rooted in place, family and the body, but also crossing oceans and into the otherworldly. It haunts and heals. Another moving collection is Sasha Dugdale\u2019s Deformations (Carcanet). One sequence explores the life and art of sculptor Eric Gill and the sexual abuse of his daughters. I\u2019m grateful that this book is in the world. It has the ability to change the landscape of how we talk about abuse and trauma. Lastly, Claudia Rankine does it again with Just Us (Allen Lane, \u00a325), compelling us to have the conversations on race that may be uncomfortable, but essential.", "Abi Dar\u00e9", "Author of The Girl With the Louding Voice", "Kirabo, the protagonist of Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi\u2019s The First Woman (Oneworld, \u00a316.99), is a wonderful, daring character who is growing up in the patriarchal society of 1970s Uganda. Intricately woven with themes of feminism, mythology and tradition, this exquisitely written and compelling story delivers a thoroughly satisfying ending. Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet (Tinder Press, \u00a320) is a beautiful, intricate story that broke my heart more than once and left me dazzled and in awe of her ingenuity. Storytelling at its finest. This Lovely City by Louise Hare (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99) is inspiring and hopeful; the story of a man, his community and the country they strive to make home. It\u2019s a skilful exploration of the racism of the Windrush era, which in many ways still feels brutally poignant.", "Tom Watson", "Politician turned author (with Imogen Robertson) of The House", "Composite: Getty Images, PR images", "Black Rain Falling (Little, Brown, \u00a314.99) by Jacob Ross is the second investigation on the Caribbean island of Camaho for the delightful duo of Miss Stanislaus and forensic expert Michael \u201cDigger\u201d Digson. When the former kills a man in self-defence, Digger is tasked with proving her innocence. Along the way, they unravel a network of corruption that could erupt at any moment, while exploring politics, religion, gender, friendship and courage. Troubled Blood (Hachette, \u00a320) by Robert Galbraith is the fifth adventure for private detective Cormoran Strike and his partner, Robin Ellacott. Forty years ago, Margot Bamborough, a young doctor, went missing without a trace. The pair take on the historical cold case, taking you to Cornwall, Clerkenwell and Hampton Court. The complicated relationship between the characters is as compelling as the plot. Trouble Is What I Do (Mulholland Books, \u00a312.99) by Walter Mosley is a subversive tale of family, class, privilege and race. When Philip \u201cCatfish\u201d Worry, a veteran Mississippi bluesman, calls on the services of Leonid McGill to complete the simple task of delivering a letter to a wealthy socialite, the world explodes. To save his musician client, McGill has to confront his own shady past, gain the trust of powerful elites and dodge the bad guys.", "Sophie Yanow", "Graphic novelist and author of The Contradictions", "Composite: Sophie Yanow, PR images", "There was wonderful graphic fiction and nonfiction out there this year. Familiar Face (Drawn & Quarterly, \u00a316.99) by Michael DeForge starts off as a funny, visually lush piece of science fiction and takes a thrilling turn into the political, with echoes of the Situationist International. Speaking of art movements, Wendy, Master of Art (Drawn & Quarterly, \u00a318.99) by Walter Scott is a pitch-perfect skewering of the fine art MFA experience, and those who enjoy it will be pleased to find there are more Wendy adventures to dig into. On a more serious note, Paying the Land (Jonathan Cape, \u00a320) by Joe Sacco is the culmination of Sacco\u2019s reportage on the Dene peoples of the Northwest Territories of Canada, and in particular their relationships with industry in their region. As usual, he creates a nuanced picture, developed primarily through his interview subjects in their own words.", ""], "authors": [], "keywords": ["book", "pr", "1699", "acclaimed", "love", "1499", "best", "2020", "world", "20", "guest", "author", "novel", "books", "read", "picked", "authors"], "pubDate": "2020-12-06T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
