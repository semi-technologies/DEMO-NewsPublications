Across the country, state officials are busy certifying the vote tallies and selecting electors to the Electoral College. Every day, it seems, the courts deliver another blow to the President\u2019s legal team. With Trump\u2019s chances of prevailing vanishingly slim, it is tempting to dismiss his incendiary behavior as grifting or theatre. Last week, I wrote about the grift factor. This past weekend, a front-page story in the Times discussed which of Shakespeare\u2019s doomed rulers Trump most resembled: Julius Caesar, Richard III, or King Lear.", "For many political insiders, the handover of power is what matters most, and, since the transition has officially begun, that is where the focus should be.", "On Sunday, Chris Wallace, of Fox News, asked Senator Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, one of the few Republicans who has publicly recognized Biden\u2019s victory, whether Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election result was damaging American democracy. \u201cThe President, in effect, has conceded when he ordered the General Services Administration to begin the transition,\u201d Cassidy replied. The senator didn\u2019t say it explicitly, but he appeared to suggest that Trump\u2019s post-election crusade is largely sound and fury. Many of his colleagues would privately agree with that characterization.", "But Trump\u2019s wild charges and rabble-rousing look very different from places like Sandy Springs, Georgia, a small city fifteen miles north of Atlanta, where Gabe Sterling lives. Having served a couple of terms on the local city council, Sterling now works for Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who enraged Trump last month by publicly dismissing his claims that Biden\u2019s victory in the state was fraudulent. After Raffensperger made this declaration, Trump targeted him on Twitter, calling him a \u201cRINO\u201d; since then, the attacks from the President and his allies have continued. Last week, Sterling himself attracted national attention when he warned \u201csomeone\u2019s going to get shot\u201d if Trump didn\u2019t cease his assaults on local officials and the election process. Sterling\u2019s timely warning drew attention to what is happening on the ground in Georgia and other states where Trump is challenging the election results.", "\u201cI have a police car outside my house right now,\u201d Sterling said, on Sunday, when Chuck Todd interviewed him on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Sterling also noted that Raffensperger\u2019s wife had received \u201csexualized, violent threats on her personal cell phone.\u201d But what finally prompted him to come forward publicly, he said, were online threats to an otherwise anonymous contractor in Georgia who worked for Dominion Voting Systems, the software vendor that is at the center of a vast Trumpian conspiracy theory. \u201cThey tracked down his family and started harassing them,\u201d Sterling recalled. \u201cAnd it said his name, \u2018You have committed treason. May God have mercy on your soul,\u2019 with a slowly swinging noose. And at that point I just said, \u2018I\u2019m done.\u2019 \u201d", "Threats of violence, and lynching, haven\u2019t been confined to Georgia. Over the weekend, a member of the Michigan state assembly, Representative Cynthia Johnson, who is African-American, posted to Facebook a number of hate messages that were left on her phone, last week, after she took part in a contentious hearing on alleged-voter fraud that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, participated in. \u201cYour name and phone number is out there now,\u201d an unidentified woman says in one of the messages. \u201cYou\u2019re getting doxed bitch. You\u2019re done. You\u2019re so f***ing done. You should be swinging from a f***ing rope, you Democrat.\u201d", "Online messages and calls of this nature are part of a broader pattern of harassment and intimidation. On Saturday evening, a crowd of pro-Trump supporters, some of them reportedly carrying firearms, gathered outside the Detroit home of Michigan\u2019s top election official, the secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson. A livestream of the protest that was posted on Facebook showed the demonstrators bellowing through horns and shouting, \u201cStop the Steal.\u201d The crowd didn\u2019t disperse until police arrived. \u201cThrough threats of violence, intimidation, and bullying, the armed people outside my home and their political allies seek to undermine and silence the will and voices of every voter in this state, no matter who they voted for,\u201d Benson said in a statement that she issued on Sunday. \u201cTheir goal is to overturn and upend the results of the election that are clear and unequivocal, and that 5.5 million Michigan citizens participated in.\u201d", "The harrying and threats aren\u2019t confined to battleground states. In Vermont, which Biden carried by more than thirty-five percentage points, the office of the secretary of state, Jim Condos, revealed last week that members of his election team had received a voice message threatening them with execution. \u201cThis has to stop,\u201d the account said on Twitter. \u201cThe wild unfounded accusations amplified by @realDonaldTrump need to stop.\u201d In Virginia and Kentucky, too, there have been reports of threats against local officials and election workers.", "From responsible local officials on both sides of the political divide, the message is the same: Trump\u2019s ego-fuelled post-election crusade is deepening already bitter divides, inciting more hatred, and increasing the likelihood of bloodshed. In modern American history, there has never been anything like this active subversion of peaceful democracy on the part of a President, and yet the response is strangely muted.", "Editor\u2019s Picks", "In part, this can be attributed to exhaustion with Trump: after nearly four years in office, he has normalized behavior previously associated with mafia bosses and tinhorn dictators. But there are other factors at play, too. On the Republican side, strategic calculations ahead of the Georgia runoffs are reinforcing the pusillanimity that many officials are displaying. \u201cThey just want to keep the Trump supporters whipped up because they think that\u2019s the best path to win the Senate races,\u201d Sterling said in his interview with Chuck Todd. Rather than backing Raffensperger and other officials who have dismissed the voter fraud accusations, including Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, national Republicans are keeping quiet. That leaves the bully pulpit to Trump.", "On the Democratic side, Trump\u2019s demagoguery has evoked widespread condemnation. But Democratic leaders would like to shift the focus to the incoming Administration, and some of them want to preserve the possibility of obtaining co\u00f6peration from Republicans in the next Senate should the G.O.P. retain control. Such considerations perhaps explain a certain tempering in their recent public response. In an interview with CNN last week, Biden went so far as to say that he could understand why many Republican senators hadn\u2019t publicly acknowledged his victory.", "Politics sometimes demands tactical behavior. Right now, though, the urgent responsibility of all elected officials in Washington\u2014especially the congressional leadership of the Republican Party\u2014is to make it clear that they stand together behind democracy. The best way to do this is to state unequivocally that the President\u2019s charges are baseless, and to demand that the targeting of local officials by Trump and his goons stop immediately. In the words of the Vermont secretary of state\u2019s office: \u201cSilence is complicity.\u201d", "Read More About the Presidential Transition"], "authors": ["John Cassidy", "John Cassid", "Susan B.
