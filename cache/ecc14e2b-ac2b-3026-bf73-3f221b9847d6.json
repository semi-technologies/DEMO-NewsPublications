After months of acclimating to the new normal, we\u2019ve procured stylish masks that keep us safe while punctuating outfits, and breathable masks to help us move through summer\u2019s hot, humid days.

In the summer months, these textiles were swapped out for more breathable, lightweight cotton and performance materials. Luckily, the thicker, safer fabrics are great for autumn weather.", "While it may be easy to opt for a ski mask, neck gaiter, or balaclava in colder months and forgo a more traditionally shaped mask that loops around your ears and covers your nose and chin, it may be counterproductive if you are constantly having to adjust the mask.

Tibi recently released a mask with an attached scarf, while other brands are continuing to lean into their protective yet warm quilter\u2019s cotton options.
