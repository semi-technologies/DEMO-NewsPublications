Or that he knew a lot about guitar players? Or that he was an ace player himself? The clickbait-industrial complex quickly discovered that Blinken had a Spotify page, with two singles he\u2019d recorded two years ago, under the handle (and pun) Ablinken. So here was another dad-rocker Pro-Tooling his sideline musings and chord changes into presentable foist-it-on-your-friends form. As someone with connections, money, and letterhead, he\u2019d had help along the way. He\u2019d played with Alex Chilton, from Big Star, and Grant Hart, from H\u00fcsker Du, and Jeff (Skunk) Baxter, the session whiz known for his work with Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers, as well as for his expertise in the field of missile defense. Blinken was also in a band with a couple of journalists and the former Obama spokesman Jay Carney. They had a bad-pun name (Coalition of the Willing) and a nice-ring-to-it genre (wonk rock). The Spotify tracks were called \u201cLip Service\u201d and \u201cPatience.\u201d Jokes wrote themselves, as they will. One sensed, in the spasm of media excitement at this bit of late-boomer geek normalcy, the giddiness, in microcosm, over a restoration at Foggy Bottom.", "Antony Blinken Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "Blinken\u2019s friends have been calling the task he faces there \u201cthe Great Undoing.\u201d Taking on the doings and non-doings of the past four years will be a knotty task, not least because the current Administration has recently kept doing new things, or allowing things to be done, that could be hard to undo. Like most people his age, Blinken, as a pre-Internet kid, presumably has his fair share of non-undoable but hard-to-dig-up juvenilia. But some of it has made the digital leap. In the early eighties, at Harvard, Blinken wrote dozens of columns in the Crimson about politics and foreign affairs. His collegiate opining should not imperil a Senate confirmation; he was no radical firebrand or real-life Alex P. Keaton. His hottest take, not unprescient, was that the Olympics, owing to cost and politics, should be permanently relocated to Switzerland.", "One also finds, interspersed with Council on Foreign Relations boilerplate, a few instances of rock criticism: juvenilia\u2019s juvenilia. Here was the future diplomat as aspiring Lester Bangs. He didn\u2019t gut anyone; he didn\u2019t pull a Jon Landau, who at Blinken\u2019s age boldly swatted down Jimi Hendrix in Rolling Stone. This was 1981-82, an odd in-between era for rock music. As Blinken, a Beatles and blues man, wrote, also not unpresciently, \u201cRecord sales are way down, new and true talent rare, and it takes prehistoric monsters like Fleetwood Mac and Crosby, Stills and Nash to deliver the goods.\u201d Nor was this period a career peak for the artists he took up: Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, the Who. (It may have been one for his lone comer, Marshall Crenshaw.) Still, Blinken would contribute more to the genre than any of his future predecessors at State. There is no record of Mike Pompeo or Warren Christopher going to the mat for Tiny Tim or Deep Purple. Perhaps they didn\u2019t know that if you wrote reviews the labels sent you freebies.", "The Who album Blinken wrote up was \u201cIt\u2019s Hard\u201d\u2014no \u201cTommy,\u201d but it had a few bangers. He began, \u201cI remember in agonizing detail a crush I had my second year of high school. After class, I would go home and release the pent-up frustration of unrequited love with my stereo. One track in particular spun over and over again on the turntable: \u2018Bargain\u2019 by The Who. As the music blasted forth, I would listen to Roger Daltrey and pretend his golden throat was mine. In my dream, the brown-eyed girl would sit entranced while I half sang, half shouted Pete Townshend\u2019s lyrics. . . . Then, charmed by my earnestness she would fall into my arms. The dream, alas, was never more than just that\u2014a dream. But The Who were always an impossible-to-ignore reality.\u201d", "The previous spring, he\u2019d written, of Lou Reed\u2019s latest, \u201c \u2018The Blue Mask\u2019 is the work of a mature artist.\u201d The record was Reed\u2019s turn away from the avowed queerness of his earlier solo work and toward an oddly timed celebration of heterosexuality and the straight married life. \u201cReed, a veteran of a difficult business and a difficult era, could easily have become a cynic with age,\u201d Blinken wrote. \u201cBut instead of displaying unalloyed disgust, Reed confronts us with a touchingly realistic album that tempers anger with hope.\u201d", "Blinken also demonstrated a diplomat\u2019s knack for conciliation in his review of Dylan\u2019s \u201cShot of Love,\u201d the last in his born-again trilogy. Critics had whacked Dylan around for his muddled pieties, but Blinken, the stepson of a Holocaust survivor, cut him some slack. \u201cWhile we do not have to agree with his every word, we should at least respect his right to be his own man,\u201d Blinken wrote. \u201cBob Dylan is no man\u2019s lackey.\u201d", "After Thanksgiving, Blinken posted a new track on Spotify, called \u201cWithout Ya.\u201d It\u2019s about a woman, naturally, but the timing of the upload, and a few of the lyrics\u2014\u201cMust be light along the way/Lead us to a brand new day\u201d\u2014could lead one to wonder if it\u2019s a statement of purpose, too. Hope, with a little anger. \u2666"], "authors": ["Nick Paumgarten", "Nick Paumgarte"], "keywords": ["blinken", "dadrocker", "reed", "rock", "dylan", "dream", "state", "work", "record", "wrote", "hed", "spotify", "department"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
