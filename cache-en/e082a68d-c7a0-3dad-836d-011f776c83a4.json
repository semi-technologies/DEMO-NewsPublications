The pilot program, a collaboration with Imagine Swimming, took place at the outdoor pool in October; it involved seven students from St. John\u2019s, a residential foster care agency for boys aged 12 to 21 located on Beach 110th Street. Some of the boys associated negative feelings with the ocean, and didn\u2019t feel comfortable going near water even though they live along it, Jigarjian\u2019s colleague who leads the initiative, Georgia Harrell, says. Others had tried, but went in up to their knees, a deceiving level at which beginner swimmers can easily be swept out to sea. The program is still in development, partially because of the limits brought on by the pandemic, but also because the hotel and Imagine Swimming plan to regroup with parents and community stakeholders to build a comprehensive program that starts with buoyancy and full body strokes and leads to lifeguard certification, says Harrell.", "To be sure, the Rockaway community, which was one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus in New York City, not to mention other tragedies\u2014most recently Hurricane Sandy and 9/11, with generations of lost firefighters and Wall Street traders\u2014is in need of more resources than a luxury hotel can likely offer. And while Jigarjian and her team do not anticipate solving the decades-long challenges belonging to Rockaway, which has long been cast aside by the city, it wants to help. \u201cFood insecurity has been very clear here,\u201d says Jigarjian of the area that\u2019s still a federally-labeled food desert. That\u2019s why the hotel is working with the community-led organization The Campaign Against Hunger to help finance a two-acre urban farm in Edgemere, which is about 70 streets east in Far Rockaway.", "Perhaps the single most important offering the hotel can give to the many hard-working families in Rockaway\u2014many of whom can\u2019t afford a $15 dollar drink at its rooftop bar\u2014is a job. At the moment, says Jigargian, \u201cemployees are 80% local to Rockaway.\u201d What\u2019s more, the hotel, which is one of 10 restaurants and bars within IGC Hospitality, is developing an eight-week workforce initiative that focuses on hospitality training. It will be free and made available to locals \u201cas soon as we can have a classroom indoors,\u201d says Jigarjian, explaining the certificate program won\u2019t only be teaching young kids how to dress for and walk into an interview. \u201cThere are a lot of people in Rockaway that want a second career, a second job, that don\u2019t want to commute into the city anymore. We can\u2019t cure anything, but what we can do is train people in hospitality.\u201d", "Photo: Courtesy of The Rockaway Hotel", "A lot is riding on the hotel on Beach 108th Street, a paved over cobblestone boulevard that was once home to Rockaway\u2019s bars and festivals and dance clubs where acts like The Platters came to play in the summers in the \u201850s. And a lot of people are rooting for them: the patrons in masks who continue to dine outside at the rooftop bar amid this unseasonably warm November, and local businesses involved in the hotel, like Goldie\u2019s Natural Beauty, Locals Surf School and The Rockaway Brewery. Even neighboring watering holes, such as Happy Jacks, which is located across the street, have high hopes for the hotel. The owner, Mike Dalton, is one of 12 in a family that once owned the restaurant where Margie\u2019s now stands. Dalton worked for the Tubridy brothers\u2019 father, a restaurateur who also owned a deli on 113th Street, not far from his mother\u2019s rooming house\u2014a Bed and Breakfast style inn that was popular on the peninsula. Back then, people from the city would come down and rent two bedrooms and a bathroom for a weekend beach getaway. The hope is that they will again."], "authors": ["Kate Branch", "Kate Branc"], "keywords": ["swimming", "jigarjian", "program", "hotel", "street", "scene", "summer", "lot", "thats", "beach", "city", "rockaway"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
