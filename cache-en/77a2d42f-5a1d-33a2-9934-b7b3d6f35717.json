For too long, the message has been repeated \u2014 by us and our colleagues, by government officials and the public \u2014 that Covid-19 is dangerous for the old and that younger people do well. It\u2019s true that deaths among adults ages 25 to 44 account for fewer than 3 percent of Covid-19 deaths in the United States, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.", "But what we believed before about the relative harmlessness of Covid-19 among younger adults has simply not been borne out by emerging data. In the past, it took us too long to respond to the epidemics of opioids and H.I.V./AIDS when the young started dying in large numbers. Now that we have similar information about Covid-19, we must immediately address it.", "We need to amend our messaging and our policies now. Outreach in the coming weeks and months is imperative.

We need to tell young people that they are at risk and that they need to wear masks and make safer choices about social distancing.", "This is even more important now that safe and effective vaccines are a reality. Young, healthy people are low on the priority list for the vaccine rollout. That means that modifying behavior now can save thousands of young lives next year.", "And that is the crux of it. Our messaging is no longer about merely flattening the curve to prevent hospitals from overflowing. Now with vaccines, our policies and our individual choices can together save a far larger number of lives.", "That challenge is ours to confront.
