It began in the 1990s when personal computers took over offices, continued with the development of the smartphone and social media in the 2000s, and in the 2010s led to cloud computing and artificial intelligence. It has contributed to two features of the world economy: the dominance of \u201csuperstar firms\u201d that have amassed valuable know-how, data and intellectual property which is hard to replicate; and an associated decline in the share of GDP accruing to workers in wages (a trend that is most evident in America).", "Will covid-19 accelerate these trends? It has been a good year for technology giants, whose shares fuelled a bull run in America\u2019s stockmarkets. In a recent essay, Nancy Rose of MIT argues that covid-19 is shifting the business landscape in a way that portends further market concentration. Greater dependence on technology is not the only mechanism at play. Another is the possibility that the downturn kills off small firms unable to weather the shock, whereas large, listed giants benefit from the liquidity backstops governments have placed behind capital markets.", "The data do not yet bear out the bankruptcy concern. In April a quarter of American small businesses shut, but by July only 6% were still closed, according to Goldman Sachs, a bank. It is large companies that have suffered from a surge in bankruptcies, possibly because of their indebtedness. Many small-business failures have been staved off by emergency government support. This year America has distributed 5.2m \u201cpaycheck protection programme\u201d loans, worth an average of $101,000 each (for comparison, there are 6m firms with fewer than 500 employees in the whole country). A working paper by Alexander Bartik of the University of Illinois and five co-authors finds that getting such a loan raised a firm\u2019s chances of survival to April 25th by 14-30 percentage points. Even if a wave of small-firm failures follows the end of government support, the businesses most at risk are restaurants, hotels and other service providers not known for market power.", "The impact of accelerated technological change is a bigger worry. Christy Johnson of Artemis Connection, a consultancy that is itself remote and advises clients on remote work, says firms vary in their ability to adapt. Bigger firms on average invest a higher share of their sales in IT . A working paper by Ufuk Akcigit of the University of Chicago and Sina Ates of the Federal Reserve argues that it is getting more difficult for firms to ape the practices of those at the frontier of their industries, and that the result is falling business dynamism and less competitive pressure on the winners. John Van Reenen of MIT says that he expects the rising importance of technology to boost winner-takes-all effects in the economy, and to increase the value of large technology investments that small firms find harder to make.", "This has not just been a good year for big technology firms. It has been good for technology in general, as it becomes more sophisticated and more crucial to success. And it is a good rule of thumb that the more digitised a market, the more likely it is to become concentrated.", "See next article: The pandemic will leave a legacy of even lower interest rates\u2014and even higher asset prices"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["competition", "firms", "remote", "technology", "working", "fittest", "survival", "university", "small", "support", "large", "market", "good"], "pubDate": "2020-10-08T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
