Istanbul Basaksehir are debutants in the Champions League and had not scored or gained a point before taking on Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side.", "Yet by the interval two barely credible errors had given Basaksehir the goals that consigned United to their first group defeat. The first was due to sub-schoolboy defending as Demba Ba was left unmarked to run through and score. The second featured Juan Mata being pickpocketed and Edin Visca eventually making the Spaniard pay.", "Solskj\u00e6r admitted this result and Sunday\u2019s 1-0 defeat by Arsenal were a \u201cpunch to the stomach\u201d and given that reverse was one of three at home in the Premier League, their campaign is already in the balance.", "Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s six changes to the side who lost to Arsenal were led by the goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who was given a first start in a major competition. Their shape of 4-2-3-1 had Donny van de Beek as the creative midfielder alongside Nemanja Matic.", "Van de Beek will have admired Harry Maguire\u2019s diagonal pass that dropped over Basaksehir\u2019s defence for Bruno Fernandes but the midfielder\u2019s volley was off-target. The home side sought to defend deep and it was a test of United\u2019s ability to overcome the sort of challenge they find difficult: one they would ultimately fail.", "One move featured Van de Beek passing to Luke Shaw, whose cross-goal drive was just missed by Marcus Rashford. What followed was amateurish. Every United player was ahead of the halfway line when the ball was taken by Berkay Ozcan after a short corner and hit to Ba, who lurked in the middle and was marked by nobody.", "This allowed the centre-forward a clear run at Henderson and after Matic, the nearest man, failed to catch him, Ba slid the ball home. More disarray followed when Axel Tuanzebe, who disappointed throughout, fouled Ba as the 35-year-old tried to go through again. Ba was unhappy the centre-back received only a booking and United were relieved the free-kick hit the wall.", "United lacked spark and execution. Fernandes beat a man then found a cul-de-sac. Matic hit a ball from the left that was easy to clear. These forays were from static starting positions so it was instructive that potency was evident only when a Basaksehir move broke down and United could counter via a Wan-Bissaka-Rashford one-two involving Anthony Martial. His effort was goal-bound before Rafael da Silva\u2019s dive blocked it.", "Less positive was the Basaksehir attack that moved swiftly through United and had Boli Bolingoli-Mbombo\u2019s cross being met by Danijel Aleksic\u2019s head, Henderson saving sharply low down.", "As the interval neared United returned to farcical mode. Mata allowed Irfan Kahveci to pilfer the ball and race down the left. His delivery was cutely dummied by Ba and Visca was there to power a shot beyond Henderson. Solskj\u00e6r was livid.", "Edin Visca fires the ball past Dean Henderson to put the hosts 2-0 ahead. Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters", "United had to respond, which they did two minutes before half-time. It was simple, too: Shaw stood a ball up and an unmarked Martial headed impressively past Mert Gunok.", "For the second half Tuanzebe was replaced by Scott McTominay, Matic dropping back to partner Maguire. Disjointedness still remained: Matic passed directly to an orange shirt; Rashford, Martial and Shaw wandered up blind alleys.", "Composure and fluidity eluded Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men. When Da Silva was wrongly penalised for a tackle on Fernandes there was a rare chance to threaten Gunok. Fernandes\u2019s free-kick did test the No 1 but it was too close to him and the ball was parried away.", "McTominay had brought a snap to United. His harrying inspired Van de Beek and with United winning possession higher up the field, their tempo of play quickened. On the hour Edinson Cavani and Paul Pogba replaced Mata and Van de Beek, later Mason Greenwood and Timothy Fosu-Mensah came on.", "Sending for the cavalry failed, though. Basaksehir were more incisive and Alexandru Epureanu\u2019s late goal-line clearance secured a famous win. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side still have six points in the group but on Saturday they are at Everton, where they must improve. Lose there and Solskj\u00e6r will face even greater scrutiny."], "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "keywords": ["beek", "united", "comedy", "ball", "henderson", "basaksehir", "solskj\u00e6rs", "victory", "errors", "basaksehirs", "van", "sets", "visca", "istanbul", "demba", "ba", "matic"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
