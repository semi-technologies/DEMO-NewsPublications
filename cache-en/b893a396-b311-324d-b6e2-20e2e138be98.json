Milan\u2019s mayor has worn one of my white shirts with the slogan Milano!Milano!Milano! printed on it. It made me so proud. Reading has always been my passion, and replacing logos with quotes from my favorite novels or poems was a very instinctive choice. One of my favorite quotes is \u201clightness isn\u2019t superficiality,\u201d which comes from Italo Calvino, who is one of my favorite authors. It encapsulates perfectly MSGM\u2019s spirit, and also it\u2019s basically how I see life.", "You\u2019ve built a successful, independent brand from scratch in Italy, a country where fashion is understood by everyone but where it is actually quite difficult for young designers to establish themselves. Why do you think that is and what advice would you give to aspiring talents?", "You have to recognize what is your best asset. And also you need a bit of luck and a certain alertness in taking advantage of moments of crisis\u2014which seems a paradox but that is actually how it works. Surely 2021 will be one of those difficult moments, but there\u2019ll be gaps in the market that can become opportunities. The digital age with its constant surfing has brought about a less faithful attitude toward brands; options have increased exponentially, so there\u2019s definitely more space for exploring newness and for enjoying the unexpected. It\u2019s true that our system hasn\u2019t been very supportive to emerging talents, and the causes are many and it would be too long to analyze them here in detail.", "But seeing the matter from my perspective\u2026young designers here aren\u2019t helped mainly because our family-centered culture is overprotective and basically makes young people spoiled, a bit lazy perhaps, with an insufficient amount of curiosity, not gutsy enough to pursue their dreams with conviction and to accept setbacks with resilience and strength of character, and also with the flexibility of mind and of attitude that the fashion world requires in spades. This is what I sometimes notice in the many job interviews I\u2019m making when I need to hire someone new for my team. Talent alone doesn\u2019t lead you anywhere. You need to have a firm grip on modernity, be involved culturally, be eager to learn and to listen and to take risks and bounce back when you\u2019re unmercifully slapped in the face! That said, building a brand is always an uphill battle everywhere in the world, not only in Italy. Beyond a steely determination to succeed, the true secret to growing a brand is surrounding yourself with an intelligent team you respect and believe in, which you can trust and you listen to\u2014but not a bunch of sycophants ready to bend at your every whim and who will never tell you the truth. You have to surround yourself with people who tell you what you\u2019re doing wrong and why. If you don\u2019t accept criticism, if you\u2019re not humble, you\u2019ll never, ever be able to move forward.", "Success is a word that has come up many times in this interview. What does the word really mean to you today?", "Success is achieving your dream\u2014there\u2019s nothing more magical than that. But it\u2019s also an enormous responsibility that you have to manage very carefully. It\u2019s like having a megaphone that amplifies everything you say or do. Once the Italian actor Massimo Troisi was asked by a journalist how he could stay level-headed being a very successful artist, and he replied, \u201cSuccess doesn\u2019t change people, but it\u2019s like a magnifying lens of what you truly are and of what you\u2019ve always been. So if you were already stupid, you\u2019ll just become even more stupid, stupidissimo.\u201d It really is that simple!"], "authors": ["Tiziana Cardini", "Tiziana Cardin"], "keywords": ["youre", "inside", "gives", "giorgetti", "10designer", "brand", "book", "favorite", "need", "peek", "young", "world", "true", "massimo", "word", "youll", "msgm", "sneak", "tell"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
