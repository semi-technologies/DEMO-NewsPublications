It\u2019s a nagging concern that clouds how the 16-year-old sees her future.", "\u201cI have a sense of dread,\u201d says Gutierrez, who lives with her parents in Milwaukee. \u201cI dread that in my lifetime the clean water I have now or the parks I\u2019m lucky enough to be able to go to won\u2019t be there any more. It weighs on my mind.\u201d", "Like a growing number of young people in the US, Gutierrez sees climate change casting a long shadow over her adult years. She has been inspired by Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, and has contacted her local elected representatives to raise her concerns.", "The looming US presidential election has only sharpened her fears, as well as underlining a generational rift in her family. In a scenario playing out in many American families, a sense of despair and outrage among young people over global heating is being met with indifference and even dismissal among some of their older relatives.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gemma Gutierrez: \u2018I dread that in my lifetime the clean water I have now or the parks I\u2019m lucky enough to be able to go to won\u2019t be there any more.\u2019 Photograph: Gemma Gutierrez", "\u201cThe climate has always changed and what\u2019s the bad part of it getting a bit warmer?

(Scientists are unequivocal that the climate is changing with human activity the primary cause.) \u201cYoungsters are youngsters,\u201d Miller says. \u201cKids go with the crowd and everyone is talking about climate change. They have to get a bit older and learn a little more.\u201d", "Gutierrez plans to write a letter to her grandparents to explain her distress, although she is mindful that previous conversations about climate change have become fractious. \u201cI would try to speak to my grandmother but the conversation automatically gets very heated,\u201d she says. \u201cShe will get very defensive and say hurtful things. What the president says is very authoritative to her. I feel [older people] are voting against the better interests of our climate and I want them to see a different perspective. I think I would be doing the world a disservice by not trying.\u201d", "I want older people to see a different perspective. I would be doing the world a disservice by not trying", "While polling shows a clear majority of Americans accept that the climate is changing and want the federal government to respond to the myriad threats this poses, the issue has been polarized in the US to extremes not seen in other leading democracies.", "An ideological aversion among Republicans to accept climate science and act against fossil fuel interests has led to two starkly different visions laid out by the 2020 presidential candidates. While Trump has rolled back dozens of pollution regulations, dismissed and sidelined climate science and pulled the US from the Paris climate accords, Joe Biden is pushing a $2tn plan to create a 100% clean energy grid within 15 years, and has called the climate crisis \u201can existential threat\u201d to the US.", "But a generational divide is also opening up, with younger people \u2013 even young conservatives \u2013 increasingly alarmed over the impact of global heating. An overwhelming 80% of voters aged between 18 and 29 consider the climate crisis \u201ca major threat to life on Earth\u201d, according to a poll taken earlier this year.

However, he believes that \u201c\u201cAnisa, because she\u2019s young, wants to make drastic changes now that won\u2019t work in the long run.
