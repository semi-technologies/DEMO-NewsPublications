Far right: Harry Davids. Beeld Private colllection", "Every August until my great-grandmother died aged 97, we would travel to northern Friesland from all over the country to help her celebrate her birthday. \u201cThank you all for coming,\u201d she would say without fail. \u201cBut there\u2019s one person missing.\u201d", "Her name was Jeltje Bakker-Woudsma, and she was scarred by the war and the years of poverty that followed. We knew that every birthday might be her last. She brought up four healthy children, and was always grateful for her life, but never made peace with the events of the postwar period.", "She and her husband Berend Bekker took a Jewish boy, Harry Leo Davids, under their wing. She described him as \u201ca small and malnourished blond kid,\u201d and treated him as her own son. A few years after the war, Harry left their household and went to live in South Africa. For a variety of reasons, and much to my great-grandmother\u2019s sorrow, they lost touch, and she mourned his departure until her death in 2004.", "As a teenager, I didn\u2019t know much about Harry, except that my great-grandparents hid him in their home in the Frisian village of Engwierum, and then he disappeared. His story was a painful chapter in the family\u2019s history, and it was made clear to me that I should not ask questions about him.", "After my great-grandmother died, no one in my immediate family knew where Harry was. Some said he no longer wanted any contact with us, because we reminded him of the war and the fact that both his parents were murdered on the same day in Sobibor concentration camp.", "Dogged resistance fighter", "My grandmother told me she\u2019d seen Harry a couple of times when he was an adult. He had personally ensured that both my great-grandparents were given the Yad Vashem award for Gentiles who helped Jews during the war. My great-grandfather, in particular, was described as a dogged and heroic pioneer of the Frisian resistance.", "My grandmother Riek Kooyenga-Bakker died in September 2018, predeceased by her two sisters and one brother. This meant that no one in the family had any direct memories of the war years, or of Harry, and his story was almost forgotten.", "That was when I began searching for Harry Leo Davids. He was an important part of our family\u2019s history, and I wanted to find him and write down his stories before he grew too old and perhaps joined the many eyewitnesses to the second world war who pass away each year.", "Before the coronavirus broke out, a reunion was to have been held for Jews who had hidden in Friesland as children during the war. There were hundreds of them, though only about seventy are still alive. The rest have died for various reasons: some betrayed during the war, others falling prey to illness, accidents, or old age.", "Even today, when it\u2019s so easy to track people down online, I had difficulty finding Harry. No one in the family had his contact details, and while I found a Facebook page, he didn\u2019t reply to my message. Perhaps he was no longer alive, or simply didn\u2019t want any contact.", "I tried various other ways of contacting Harry, but in vain. One other family member was even more obsessed than me about tracking him down: Harry Kooyenga, my uncle on my mother\u2019s side, born in 1970 and named after him. Harry Davids had clearly made a big impression on my grandparents.", "I was close to my uncle: he was only fifteen years older than me, and we had a lot of interests in common. When I was a child, he was the only relative whose home I ever stayed at, the first to take me to the cinema, and the person who taught me to play football.", "Uncle Harry", "So while Harry is officially my uncle, he feels more like a friend or even a brother. He\u2019s the kind of uncle you look up to, hoping he\u2019ll show up at family events so they don\u2019t get too boring.", "The very first photo of me (right) and my uncle Harry Kooyenga, 1986. Beeld prive-archief", "And it was he who eventually managed to contact Harry Davids through a cousin in Amsterdam. Soon afterwards, towards the end of 2018, the two Harrys and I began exchanging emails and made plans to get together.", "Harry wanted to meet Harry, and vice versa. Harry Davids was delighted and honoured to discover that his \u201cwar sister\u201d had named her son after him, and I saw the encounter as the perfect chance to fill in some of the gaps in the family\u2019s history.", "Harry Davids invited us to Los Angeles, where he lived. He told us he\u2019d retired from his job as a tax consultant, and was now working in the Simon Wiesenthal Museum and the Holocaust Museum, sharing my great-grandparents \u2018story with visitors. Every one of his emails mentioned that Berend Bakker and Jeltje Bakker-Woudsma were his heroes.", "Over the months that followed, Uncle Harry and I pieced together more information about them, and we tried to agree a date to see Harry Davids in Los Angeles. This took us a whole year, and we eventually decided that we\u2019d visit from 4 to 10 February.", "Death sentence", "With hindsight that was far too long, and we\u2019d wasted precious time. In mid-December 2019, shortly after we\u2019d agreed dates, Uncle Harry became really ill. He lay in bed for weeks, his normally healthy body racked by headaches and vomiting, and on the day after Christmas they told him he had a large tumour on his brain. He was only 49, but it was a death sentence, and the doctors said there was nothing they could do. He couldn\u2019t even sit up in bed, let alone walk.", "In the weeks that followed, as he lay there, we discussed whether I should still go and see Harry Davids in Los Angeles. We\u2019d been looking forward like children to this very special trip, uncle and nephew going to America together, and we were sure it was going to be a journey to remember. Now I knew he had months left at most, I was at a loss what to do.", "\u201cYou must go to Los Angeles,\u201d Uncle Harry said, lying in the hospital bed that had now been placed in his living room. He\u2019d lost his appetite, and was looking increasingly gaunt, spending the whole time lying on his left side to reduce the headaches. \u201cI want you to go, and then come back as soon as you can and tell me all your stories.\u201d", "So I took my brother Ruben along. He\u2019s three years younger than me, and had always been a huge fan of Uncle Harry. I wanted to share the journey with someone I loved, and my mother was reluctant to leave her brother\u2019s bedside during the short time he had left.", "Before we left, we agreed we\u2019d spend three days with Harry Davids. He wanted to show us the work he does in the museums, and we hoped to share these experiences with Uncle Harry, since the two Harrys would probably never see each other.", "As we made our final preparations, I searched high and low for more information about my great-grandparents\u2019 time in the resistance and Harry Davids\u2019 wartime experiences. I filled in some of the gaps with the help of books, documentaries, discussions with experts, and Tresoar, the Frisian historical centre in Leeuwarden. But I knew I\u2019d never be able to write the whole story, because there were no immediate witnesses left and some of the stories were fragmentary.", "As I learned more about my great-grandfather\u2019s role in the war, I became increasingly proud of him. Marre Faber-Sloots, project manager at Tresoar and now curator of the Frisian Resistance Museum, researched his story. She told me: \u201cI don\u2019t know if your great-grandfather realised this, but he was up to his neck in the resistance. If he\u2019d been captured by the Germans, they\u2019d have killed him and his wife immediately.", "\u201cHe fought for freedom, resisted the occupiers wherever he could, hid fugitives, and was involved in all sorts of illegal activities. He was a brave and determined man.\u201d", "False names", "Parts of the story are officially documented. The main source of information about his involvement in the resistance is a letter he wrote shortly after the war to Stichting 1940-1945, an organisation that helps victims of the conflict. The letter sets out the reasons for his brave actions. As a reformed Christian, he decided in 1940 that he had no choice but to fight in the resistance. \u201cMy wife and I engaged in illegal activities and fought with the resistance out of principle, religious conviction, and duty to our people. Basically, we did it because it was the only thing we could do.\u201d", "My great-grandfather ran a post office in his own home, a job that enabled him to move illegal goods around without attracting attention. His mailbags were often full of illicit radios, bags of supplies for Jews and other fugitives and, later on, arms and ammunition. He used a variety of false names: one was Piet Slager, and he also had an identity card in the name of Roelof Bouwstra.", "He was also involved in other activities. He and his comrades hid the contents of a weapons drop in the church attic; he distributed underground newspapers in northeast Friesland, and also carried out reconnaissance, since his job handling and delivering mail enabled him to view German strategic defence infrastructure on an almost daily basis. In the evenings, he would covertly pass this information on by phone.", "While his wife and four children waited for him at home, my great-grandfather risked his life several times. One letter he wrote after the war describes how a German commandant shot at him. \u201cSome of the bullets lodged in the tree I was standing behind. We knew what we had to do: we ran and ran and ran across ditches and canals. I got home at eleven, soaked to the skin, with duckweed in my hair. The next morning, I delivered the post as usual to the commandant who had shot at me.\u201d", "Revolvers under the mattress", "Towards the end of the war, the Germans were on my great-grandfather\u2019s trail, and he went to ground for four months. He continued his work with the resistance, hiding revolvers, rifles, and Sten guns under his own wife\u2019s mattress. During liberation, at the age of 45, he fought with the allies and the Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten, a coalition of resistance groups. It was a bloody battle, and the letter describes how thirty Germans were killed or wounded and another hundred taken prisoner.", "Harry Davids as a boy, date unknown. Beeld Private collection", "But his greatest act of altruism was bringing up Harry Davids. For four years, he loved him as much as his own children, and sometimes even a little more.", "Once, the village\u2019s most feared informer, nicknamed Sije Swyn, Sije the Swine, taunted my great-grandfather about the child. \u201cHe\u2019s a Jew, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m going to report you.\u201d To which my great-grandfather retorted: \u201cIf you breathe one word of this, I\u2019ll put a bullet through your brain. Don\u2019t you dare.\u201d Sije the Swine appears to have been suitably intimidated, and never brought up the subject again.", "With stories like this in mind, my brother and I flew to Los Angeles on 4 February. Harry Davids had laid on a detailed three-day programme of visits to museums and other sights. He was the only living person who\u2019d experienced the war with members of my family, and our first handshake felt like an encounter with a figure from the history books. At first, it was hard to believe that this friendly, grey-haired man had been looked after by my great-grandparents seventy-five years ago.", "Harry is a lively man of 77, just under five feet seven inches tall. He lives in Los Angeles because, in his words, \u201cthis is where it\u2019s all at.\u201d While born in Amsterdam \u2013 he spent his first few months in Jekerstraat, in the Zuid district \u2013 he knows this city well, from the latest Hollywood movies to the doings of the Lakers basketball team. And he\u2019s the kind of driver who puts his foot down when the lights are orange at busy intersections, just to steal a march on the other cars.", "A stroke of luck", "During our three days together, and wherever we went, Harry was a fund of anecdotes. He said he\u2019d tried to forget his past, but when he retired in 2007 he decided to put his grief aside and embark on what he refers to as his life\u2019s work. \u201cI talk about the Holocaust in museums and schools, and I\u2019m doing it for your family, the Bakkers,\u201d he told us. \u201cI owe them everything, including my life, and I want everyone to know that. I was part of a historic event, and I just got lucky.\u201d", "Myself, Harry Davids, and my brother Ruben Sijtsma in Los Angeles. Beeld Linda Stulic", "We could see how indebted Harry felt. He chauffeured us around, picked us up every evening, insisted on paying for coffee, lunch, and dinner, and kept asking what we\u2019d like to do that day.", "He told us all about his personal life: he\u2019s unmarried, has no children, and never met the love of his life \u2013 though he did once meet a potential candidate as a teenager. She was playing tennis and had a beautiful laugh. He couldn\u2019t pluck up the courage to talk to her, looked out for her for years afterwards, and could have kicked himself for not approaching her. Harry has lived alone for most of his life, but emphasises that he never feels lonely.", "He carries a white folder of personal documents and memories of deceased family members. He never really knew any of them, but they\u2019re pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that is his life.", "\u201cI\u2019ve spent all my life looking for my roots. I didn\u2019t know anything about my parents, grandfathers and grandmothers, or most of my uncles and aunts. I\u2019ve used these documents to try and assemble the puzzle, because it gives me answers about who I am. When you do a jigsaw, you can use the picture on box as a guide. I don\u2019t have that box, just an incomplete pile of documents that I keep trying to fit together.\u201d", "Candy wrappers", "Harry showed us a sheet of white paper in the folder. It had two Haagse Hopjes candy wrappers stuck to it, and my brother and I looked at him quizzically. \u201cYour grandma sent me bags of them for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cShe thought I liked them, and she was right.\u201d We never knew that, and nor did any of our relatives. During our stay, Harry told us everything he\u2019d discovered over the years. Every day, the interaction was the same: we asked questions, he talked.", "Harry Davids, 77, February 2020. Beeld Linda Stulic", "Davids was one of the Jewish children smuggled by members of the resistance from the cr\u00e8che in the Hollandse Schouwburg theatre on Amsterdam\u2019s Plantage Middenlaan. This was where the Germans assembled local Jews for deportation to the Westerbork transit camp in the northeastern Netherlands, and from there to Poland. They did not know their destination, but Harry\u2019s parents, Alfred Israel Davids and Berta Lily Berg, were suspicious and tried to save their only son from the Nazis. In March 1943, when he was less than six months old, they gave permission to the resistance to take him away, and never saw him again. \u201cIt was a heart-rending decision, but they had no choice,\u201d he told us.", "Harry talked about his parents, whom he doesn\u2019t remember, at the Simon Wiesenthal Museum, shortly after he\u2019d given his weekly lecture about his life to an audience of thirty. I scribbled notes as he spoke, so I could tell Uncle Harry everything he said when I returned to the Netherlands.", "\u201cMy parents died a week later, on the same day, at the Sobibor extermination camp. It\u2019s possible they were on the same train. I hope so, because that makes me feel better. I hope that death in the gas chamber was quick and painless, preferable to starvation and torture. My parents were two of 71 family members who didn\u2019t survive the war. There were only five of us left in 1945.", "\u201cI\u2019ve since found out that they gave me an international first name so they could flee abroad with me and start a new life, but it was too late. I really wish I could just have one conversation with them. Why didn\u2019t they hide? Was it something to do with my mother being pregnant? But why did she get pregnant during the war?", "\u201cMy arrival undoubtedly caused them serious problems. If I hadn\u2019t come along they might have survived the war, but it was very hard to hide if you were pregnant or had a baby. I\u2019ll never get any answers, and I\u2019ll never know who they really were, but I\u2019m grateful that they gave me to the resistance. That changed the course of my life.\u201d", "According to Harry\u2019s documents, after he was smuggled out of the cr\u00e8che a student named Gisela S\u00f6hnlein took him to Utrecht. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea how I got from there to Noord-Friesland. All I know is that it was nearly nine months until I arrived at your great-grandparents\u2019 in Engwierum just before Christmas in 1943. I probably passed through the hands of lots of people in the resistance.\u201d", "Malnourished", "Harry Davids was barely a year old when he arrived at the home of my great-grandfather, who had been asked to find him somewhere to live in the Frisian countryside. All he knew about the malnourished child in his arms was his name. The baby had no clothes, and was covered in sores, bruises, and other injuries. It had been difficult to find a home for him because people were afraid he might be sick, and taking him in was very risky and could lead to severe punishment.", "My great-grandmother immediately fell for the little blond boy. \u201cIf no one wants him, we\u2019ll have to look after him ourselves,\u201d she said. She smothered him in love, and he ate and drank until he looked healthy again. Meanwhile, her husband tried in vain to find him a new home, and after a month they decided to keep him.", "There were four children in the family, but only the eldest daughter, a teenager, knew that Harry wasn\u2019t really her brother. There was some gossip in the village about the Jewish boy living with the Bakker family, and German soldiers once ordered that his trousers be pulled down to see whether he was circumcised, but my great-grandmother came up with some excuse and he managed to escape without scrutiny.", "Harry spent the rest of the war with the Bakker family, and was still safe when the Netherlands was liberated. In the ensuing chaos, no relatives stepped up to claim him, but my great-grandparents had long since stopped making any distinction between him and their four real children. He was one of them, and always would be.", "All this changed in 1946 when an uncle, Harry\u2019s father\u2019s brother, showed up, wanting to take Harry to his home in South Africa. Too many members of his family had died, and it was essential that he join them.", "Court case", "The result was a court case in Amsterdam. Much later, Harry spoke to one of the jurors. \u201cThe judge said my case was the most difficult of his life. On the one hand there was your family, who after three years saw me as their son. And on the other was my uncle, one of the few surviving members of the Davids family.", "\u201cBoth parties had the best of intentions. The jury was split, so the judge had the casting vote. He spent nearly a week thinking about it, and awarded custody to my uncle in May 1947. Your great-grandparents were devastated. I don\u2019t think your great-grandmother Jeltje ever got over the grief. If I\u2019d been in the judge\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d have seen both sides of the situation, and there was a lot of love from both parties.\u201d", "Harry\u2019s first memory of his move to South Africa is that his ears bled because of the cabin pressure on the flight. He grew up with his three young female cousins, whom he came to regard as sisters. In 1949, his uncle and aunt told him they were not his real parents, which he didn\u2019t understand; he had no memories of Engwierum, and assumed he was born in South Africa.", "What he didn\u2019t know was that my great-grandparents in the Netherlands were regularly sending him letters and cards, which his uncle and aunt hid or destroyed to avoid confusing him even further.", "\u201cThe Bakker family must have been in absolute despair\u201d, he told me. \u201cThey never got a reply to any of their many approaches, and it wasn\u2019t until I was older that I discovered one of their cards. I still carry it with me everywhere I go.\u201d He read out the card, which bore a stamp depicting Queen Wilhelmina.", "Engwierum, 17/8/47", "Dear Harry,", "Can you see our little house amid the trees, and Jensma\u2019s farmhouse? And the church with its stumpy tower? And Kerkepad, where you used to ride your bike all the time? Will we hear from you soon, and will you write us a letter?", "Best wishes", "A big kiss from Mum and Dad", "The postcard that Harry Davids always carries with him. Beeld Private collection", "Harry had a hard time at school in South Africa. He was bullied because of his Jewish origins, and the teachers had to break up fights when other kids called him a filthy Jew for the umpteenth time.", "Harry did not feel at home in this segregated country. \u201cIt was like Europe before the war,\u201d he says. \u201cApartheid. Separate black and white entrances for blacks and whites in restaurants, toilets, and public buildings. The atmosphere was hostile, and it was a fool\u2019s paradise. There was constant violence on the streets, you didn\u2019t feel safe as a white boy, and there were burglaries nearby every night.", "\u201cA race war was about to break out, and I did what I could during my time as a student. A group of us set up a political party to build bridges between black and white. We wanted to change people\u2019s thought patterns, but the idea didn\u2019t stand a chance. I moved to the States in the 1970s to start a new life, and my uncle, aunt, and cousins came along with me \u2013 they found South Africa dangerous as well.\u201d", "Harry saw my great-grandmother one more time. In 1968, more than twenty years after he left the Netherlands, he returned to thank her for her courage during the war. \u201cIt was extremely emotional for her. She cried endlessly, and we didn\u2019t say very much. All she did was hug me. It was also painful for her that I saw her as a stranger, and had no memory of her or the war. She was seeing her son returning, whereas it felt like I was seeing her for the first time.\u201d", "Farewell", "My great-grandfather had died suddenly in the previous year, aged 68, so the last time Harry saw his rescuer was in the 1940s. \u201c I owe my life to that man. He\u2019s my hero, and I\u2019ll never forget what he did for me. I hate that I never saw him again, and the work I\u2019m doing in the museums is for him.\u201d", "Harry still talks about the Bakker family, from a little Frisian village, on a weekly basis in museums and schools in Los Angeles.", "After our last meeting, he dropped us off at our rented apartment and shook our hands. As we left, he promised to carry on doing this job until he\u2019s no longer able to: he\u2019s doing it for his dead relatives, and for his namesake, my uncle Harry. He asks us to send his best wishes to all of Berend Bakker\u2019s and Jeltje Bakker-Woudsma\u2019s surviving descendants. \u201cEspecially your uncle Harry.

Time was running short, and he was eating less and sleeping more.
