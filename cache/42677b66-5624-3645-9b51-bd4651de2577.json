Back in 2016, when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced that its employees were no longer required to wear suits\u2014the implied alternative was a shirt and slacks\u2014the news made international headlines. It even prompted Vogue\u2019s resident menswear critic, Luke Leitch, to investigate further and ask tailoring icons such as Giorgio Armani for their thoughts. At the time, the Italian designer insisted the suit will never disappear: \u201cIn my opinion, the tailored suit can be the perfect garment even for today\u2019s fast, athletic, and on-the-go generations,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you have to do is skillfully interpret it according to the times.\u201d", "Armani\u2019s words feel especially prescient now. Because while midtown tailors are struggling to find business and American suitmakers are closing or declaring bankruptcy (see: Men\u2019s Warehouse, Brooks Brothers), tailoring has never been bigger on the streets. The difference is in that interpretation: In Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo, Taipei, and beyond, the suits we\u2019re seeing aren\u2019t formal in the least, and they probably weren\u2019t made to measure, either. They\u2019re oversized, mismatched, vintage, or maybe even a bit rumpled, and they\u2019re being worn with T-shirts and sneakers, not French cuffs and wingtips. In other words: They\u2019re hardly your 9-to-5 suits. As Armani predicted, it\u2019s tailoring interpreted for the times we\u2019re living in. A thrown-on suit checks all the boxes of how we want to look right now: cool, comfortable, and unfussy.", "Of course, there\u2019s much to be said about the care and artistry that goes into a bespoke suit. Those tailors and suitmakers (and the myriad other people involved in the supply chain\u2014the wool suppliers, patternmakers, textile mills, et al) need our support, because we will go back to the office and attend events again. Plenty of designers seem to believe we\u2019ll be back in \u201cformal suits\u201d as soon as spring 2021: Balmain\u2019s Olivier Rousteing showed neon blazers with major shoulders, and in his first collection for Givenchy, Matthew Williams liked the combination of boxy, hip-length jackets and skinny trousers.", "For now, we\u2019re looking to street style in Europe and Asia for our casual suit inspiration\u2014especially as we continue to do most of our socializing and dining outdoors and on the street.
