McConnell, a prosecutor at the Department of Justice and a former marine, left his phone in a box designed to block electronic transmissions, and passed through a metal detector and a key-card-protected air lock to enter the building. On the second floor, he punched in the code for his office door, then locked it behind him. On a computer approved for the handling of classified information, he loaded a series of screenshots he had taken, showing entries in a database called Helios, which federal law enforcement uses to track drug smugglers. McConnell e-mailed the images to a classified government hotline for whistle-blowers. Then he printed backup copies and, following government procedures for handling classified information, sealed them in an envelope that he placed in another envelope, marked \u201cSECRET.\u201d He hid the material behind a piece of furniture.", "McConnell had uncovered what he described as a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d perpetrated by the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. Every year, entries in the Helios database lead to hundreds of drug busts, which lead to prosecutions in American courts. The entries are typically submitted to Helios by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the F.B.I., and a division of the Department of Homeland Security. But McConnell had learned that more than a hundred entries in the database that were labelled as originating from F.B.I. investigations were actually from a secret C.I.A. surveillance program. He realized that C.I.A. officers and F.B.I. agents, in violation of federal law and Department of Justice guidelines, had concealed the information\u2019s origins from federal prosecutors, leaving judges and defense lawyers in the dark. Critics call such concealment \u201cintelligence laundering.\u201d In the nineteen-seventies, after C.I.A. agents were found to have performed experiments with LSD on unwitting Americans and investigated Vietnam War protesters, restrictions were imposed that bar the agency from being involved in domestic law-enforcement activities. Since the country\u2019s founding, judges, jurors, and defendants have generally had the right to know how evidence used in a trial was gathered. \u201cThis was undisclosed information, from an agency working internationally with different rules and standards,\u201d Nancy Gertner, a retired federal district judge and a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School, told me. \u201cThis should worry Trump voters who talk about a \u2018deep state.\u2019 This is the quintessential deep state. This is activities beyond your view, fundamentally affecting what happens in American courts.\u201d", "But the scheme benefitted the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.: the former received information obtained during operations, and the latter reported increased arrests and was able to secure additional federal funding as a result. The scope of the scheme was corroborated in hundreds of pages of e-mails, transcripts, and other documents obtained by The New Yorker.", "For weeks, C.I.A. officials had been trying to stop McConnell from revealing the agency\u2019s activities. They sent a lawyer to Key West with nondisclosure agreements, but McConnell refused to sign. A day before his early arrival at the office, McConnell had learned of an order to delete the screenshots on his computer. \u201cI knew that I had to get the electronic evidence to outside investigators,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere was no doubt about what I needed to do, and there was no doubt retaliation against me would follow.\u201d He worked quickly, not knowing when security officers would arrive. Later that day, they came to McConnell\u2019s office and deleted the images.", "A little more than a month later, after C.I.A. officials accused McConnell of \u201cspilling\u201d classified information, the director of the task force suspended him. Soon, the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, visited the task force and was briefed on the matter. According to a sworn affidavit that McConnell filed with the Senate Intelligence Committee, and to a source with knowledge of the meeting, Haspel said that there needed to be repercussions for McConnell. (A C.I.A. spokesperson, Timothy Barrett, called the allegation \u201cinaccurate and a gross mischaracterization.\u201d) The military leadership of the task force ignored McConnell\u2019s appeal of his suspension, and discussions about future assignments came to an abrupt halt. Six officials said that they believed the C.I.A. had retaliated against McConnell, leaving him nominally employed but unable to find a new post after decades of public service.", "\u201cThis was appalling and blatant,\u201d Tom Padden, one of McConnell\u2019s supervisors, who has filed his own whistle-blower complaint, told me. \u201cIt was a blatant attempt to silence a career public servant who identified a real issue.\u201d McConnell and other officials accused Patrick Hovakimian, the Associate Deputy Attorney General, of failing to protect McConnell. Hovakimian is President Trump\u2019s nominee to become the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and his handling of whistle-blower issues has been a central question in his confirmation process. (A Justice Department spokesperson said that Hovakimian enlisted a department lawyer and other officials \u201cto ensure that any whistle-blower was treated appropriately.\u201d)", "Last month, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, notified Attorney General William Barr and Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director, that the committee would be investigating McConnell\u2019s allegations and requested records related to his case. Senator Ron Wyden, of Oregon, said that he would be calling on the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate as well, and told me, \u201cSenior officials should never punish employees who raise concerns about abuse, especially when it concerns secret programs or activities.\u201d McConnell said, \u201cThe C.I.A. has corrupted F.B.I. agents to violate basic rules as to how the Department of Justice does criminal prosecutions.\u201d", "Mark McConnell, who is sixty-six, was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He was brought up by his grandparents, a paper-mill worker and a homemaker. When McConnell was seven, he took to wearing the garrison cap of his father, a former marine. McConnell was the first in his family to go beyond high school; he counted coins at the Federal Reserve Coin Vault to pay for junior college, which he attended at night. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a law degree from Florida State University before returning to Jacksonville to work as a public defender. Later, he spent six years on active duty in the U.S. Marines. After leaving active duty, in 1995, he worked as a state prosecutor and at the Department of Justice, where for sixteen years he has investigated fraud, corruption, national-security matters, and drug trafficking. McConnell has a salt-and-pepper mustache and speaks in a clipped Southern accent. \u201cHe\u2019s of a high moral character,\u201d a law-enforcement official who has worked with him told me. \u201cMatter of fact, he\u2019s so straight it sometimes annoys people.\u201d", "In July, 2017, McConnell was assigned to the Joint Interagency Task Force South, in Key West. It comprises people from various parts of the military, law-enforcement agencies including the D.E.A. and the F.B.I., and intelligence agencies including the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. McConnell kept his office sparse\u2014the only sign of his military service was a photograph of the decorated marine Chesty Puller, with the quote \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded. That simplifies things.\u201d", "Shortly after McConnell began working at the task force, a D.E.A. special agent named William Cambre stopped by his office. Cambre, a Louisiana native who had worked drug cases at the D.E.A. for more than fifteen years, told him that he had discovered troubling entries in the Helios database. They were labelled as having been submitted by the F.B.I., based on unclassified sources and methods, but they contained G.P.S. co\u00f6rdinates that were updated with unusual frequency. The entries were marked \u201cSECRET/NOFORN,\u201d a classification level that prevents disclosure to foreign nationals. Intelligence and law-enforcement officials later told me that the information came from a C.I.A. special-access program, one of the highest categories of classification in the government. The program, which one intelligence official described to me as \u201cinherently extra-sensitive,\u201d involved national-security surveillance. It also captured information that was unrelated to its mission but useful for finding drug traffickers. Cambre told McConnell that the F.B.I. had refused to answer questions about the source of the information, which he believed came from \u201cthe Christians\u201d\u2014slang for the C.I.A. \u201cThis is what they\u2019re writing in Helios,\u201d Cambre told him. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d (An F.B.I. spokesperson said that the Bureau reviewed the arrangement with the C.I.A. and considered it \u201cconsistent with our internal protocols and legal requirements.\u201d)", "Searching Helios, McConnell ultimately found more than a hundred entries that bore the deceptive labelling Cambre had described. An F.B.I. agent estimated that fifty-seven prosecutions had relied on these entries. I was able to identify nineteen resulting criminal convictions. In all of the cases, U.S. Coast Guard cutters, relying on information from Helios, had intercepted small vessels on the open waters of the Pacific. They confiscated bales of cocaine, and arrested men from Ecuador, Colombia, and Mexico, who were taken to the U.S. to face trial. All nineteen pleaded guilty to federal drug charges and are now serving sentences ranging from six to fourteen years. The men, who worked at the lowest level of the drug trade, were poor and uneducated. Antonio Jorge Narvaez Tubay, a fisherman and a construction worker from Guayaquil, Ecuador, was apprehended south of Mexico in February, 2018. A sixty-year-old with four children, he had been struggling to care for his infirm father. \u201cI was so desperate, and I was so poor,\u201d he told the judge in his case.", "\u201cI found the protagonist unsympathetic.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Kate Isenberg", "It was not disclosed in the court proceedings that classified C.I.A. information had led the Coast Guard to the locations of the smugglers. In most of the cases, including Narvaez\u2019s, F.B.I. agents submitted affidavits attributing the arrests to routine patrols. McConnell and other officials said that the affidavits were intentionally misleading, denying prosecutors the information they needed to properly meet discovery obligations, and undermining the resulting convictions. \u201cIf I had learned that a law-enforcement agent had not been forthcoming about reliance on classified information in a case that was prosecuted, I would have had a conniption,\u201d David Laufman, a former prosecutor and a senior Department of Justice official, said.", "\u201cWe always wondered how the fuck they figured out where these fishermen were,\u201d Ricardo Hermida, who represented Narvaez, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a discovery violation. We were operating under misconceptions.\u201d (The Justice Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe government believed at the time, and continues to believe after its careful review, that the information underlying this claim was simply not discoverable.\u201d)", "Under current law, federal prosecutors can disclose the presence of classified C.I.A. information to judges and request that it be shielded during trials for national-security reasons. Michael V. Hayden, who directed the C.I.A. under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, cautioned that law enforcement is not allowed to fabricate information, but he insisted that some programs are too sensitive for even limited court consultations, and defended the use of concealed intelligence in domestic trials. \u201cWe do that routinely,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe know something, but we can\u2019t say it, so we have to say it through someone else. Then we use it in court. It\u2019s not illegal, but it\u2019s complicated.\u201d Other experts questioned that view. Mary McCord, a law professor and a former acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said that, when a court refuses to protect sensitive intelligence, \u201cwe have to say we\u2019ll just dismiss the case. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work. And government officials aren\u2019t supposed to say, \u2018We don\u2019t want to deal with that, so we\u2019re just going to lie.\u2019 \u201d", "In August, 2017, McConnell called his supervisor Tom Padden, who was in Washington, D.C. \u201cWhen I get really pissed,\u201d McConnell told me, \u201cI get monotone, I don\u2019t blink.\u201d He related to Padden what he had found in the Helios database. Padden, sixty and heavyset, with a neatly cropped white beard, served in the Marines for twelve years before becoming a civilian prosecutor. He met McConnell when they were both stationed in Quantico, Virginia, and recruited him for the task force. Padden shared McConnell\u2019s respect for rules. \u201cWe are talking about the withholding and misrepresentation of information to prosecutors by agents who are supposedly part of the prosecutorial team. We\u2019ve got discovery problems, ethical problems there,\u201d Padden told me. \u201cYou gotta have at least a prosecutorial supervisor in the know.\u201d", "In the following months, other officials independently raised concerns about the concealed intelligence. In late February, 2018, Dick Getchell, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida, e-mailed McConnell, asking to talk about \u201ccases where targeting information does not appear to be LE-sourced\u201d (the abbreviation stands for \u201claw enforcement\u201d). The same day, Getchell e-mailed the F.B.I. about a case resulting from a deceptive database entry. \u201cPlease advise as to the nature and substance of the information which FBI Miami provided which resulted in this seizure,\u201d he wrote. Rhonda Squizzero, an F.B.I. special agent, replied that the targeting information had been gathered in an F.B.I. operation called Black Pearl, made up of investigations called World\u2019s End, Calypso, and Wicked Wench\u2014all references to the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d film series. She wrote that those investigations had generated \u201ccase debriefs and electronic evidence\u201d that pointed to a Mexican crime organization called La Victoria. McConnell and several other sources said that the investigations were a cover and could not be the source of the information. In a subsequent e-mail, Getchell expressed skepticism about La Victoria as well, writing that it was a group that \u201cour office has never heard of.\u201d In fact, there is no evidence that any such organization exists. The F.B.I. spokesperson said that the Bureau takes \u201ca host of precautions to protect both the intelligence we receive and the sources and methods used to gather it. This can include using code names.\u201d", "\u201cEveryone in the building knew this was crap,\u201d one law-enforcement official told me. \u201cWhat they were doing was bullshitting.\u201d", "McConnell and Padden also raised their concerns with C.I.A. and F.B.I. officials, who defended the concealment. In February, 2018, they met for three hours with the agency\u2019s senior operative on the task force. (The New Yorker is not publishing the C.I.A. operative\u2019s name, for safety reasons.) The operative argued against disclosing the C.I.A.\u2019s role, either in the database or to prosecutors, saying that the arrangement benefitted both the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. The F.B.I., the C.I.A. operative said, was \u201ca good partner.\u201d", "That spring and summer, the C.I.A. operative grew increasingly hostile to McConnell. During a meeting in March, according to McConnell, the operative warned, \u201cIf people keep talking about our program, someone is going to need to go to prison.\u201d A month later, a meeting devolved into a shouting match. \u201cIf that cocksucker Cambre wants to fuck me in the ass, the least he can do is use some lubricant,\u201d several people familiar with the conversation recalled the operative saying, referring to the D.E.A. agent who had initially raised the matter. \u201cHe\u2019s going all ballistic,\u201d McConnell told me, of the operative. \u201cHe was just lit.\u201d"], "authors": ["Ronan Farrow", "Ronan Farro"], "keywords": ["told", "fbi", "coverup", "department", "targeted", "whistleblower", "officials", "federal", "cia", "mcconnell", "intelligence", "task", "information"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
