The discipline, which holds racism as a pervasive condition rather than merely as hateful conduct, emerged in American academia in the 1980s, and crossed the Atlantic two decades later. It uses the concept of \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d to refer not just to hooded Klansmen, but to the everyday advantages afforded to white people. It has shaped the thinking of many in the Black Lives Matter ( BLM ) movement. Yet it had not much stirred the Conservative Party until Kemi Badenoch, a Treasury minister who also speaks for the government on equalities issues, declared the government to be \u201cunequivocally against critical race theory\u201d, calling it \u201can ideology that sees my blackness as a victimhood and their whiteness as an oppression\u201d.", "Mrs Badenoch\u2019s remarks in a debate on Black History Month, an annual observance marked in Britain since 1987, are evidence of a change in the Conservative Party that has accelerated since the last election. There were just two ethnic-minority Tory MP s when David Cameron became leader in 2005. He sought to fix that by parachuting high-flying ethnic-minority candidates into target seats. There are now 22 non-white Tory MP s out of 365, and 65 altogether in the Commons. (If Parliament reflected Britain\u2019s ethnic make-up, there would be 85.) Boris Johnson\u2019s successor may well be non-white. The family of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is from India; the parents of Priti Patel, the home secretary, were Ugandan Asians. Mrs Badenoch, first elected to the safe Tory seat of Saffron Walden in Essex in 2017, has risen swiftly. James Cleverly, a foreign-office minister, was the first black chairman of the Conservative Party.", "Superficially, the Conservative and Labour parties talk about race in similar terms. Both celebrate Britain\u2019s increased diversity, take pride in their non-white lawmakers and mark Black History Month. Britain\u2019s model of multiculturalism is no longer contested by any serious politician. Labour heavily outpolls the Tories among non-white voters overall, but this masks broad gaps between groups: black voters are likelier than Indians or Chinese to describe the Tory party as racist.", "Yet there are deep differences in the views of MP s from the two parties (see chart). That was evident in the debate on October 20th. Tory speakers emphasised meritocracy and the individual; Labour, what Marsha de Cordova, Mrs Badenoch\u2019s opposite number, called \u201ca systemic problem [which] requires systemic solutions\u201d. Tory speakers said Black History Month should be part of a diverse island story, celebrating the role of black soldiers in British victories. Labour speakers stressed black political struggles and Britain\u2019s complicity in slavery as much as its role in ending it. Labour MP s accused Conservative ones of naivety and evasiveness about inequality; Tories accused Labour of fostering division and grievance.", "During Mr Cameron\u2019s tenure, the Conservative Party would have hewed closer to Labour\u2019s line in such debates, reckon some black Tories. But the emergence of a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of non-white lawmakers has given it the confidence to develop a distinctively conservative line. \u201cWe are no longer willing to be pushed around on this by Labour,\u201d says one. Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a think-tank which specialises in integration, says there\u2019s a new \u201cpartisan spikiness\u201d to the debate. Munira Mirza, head of the Number 10 policy unit, is dubious of the concept of \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d, a mainstay of British policymaking since the 1990s. She accused Theresa May, Mr Johnson\u2019s predecessor, of appeasing a \u201cculture of grievance\u201d.", "A second factor is America\u2019s race debate, which has sharpened the parties\u2019 long-held views. Some Labour MP s embrace the global span of the BLM movement. Mrs Badenoch, by contrast, who spent much of her childhood in Nigeria, argues that \u201can imported, Americanised narrative of slavery, segregation and Jim Crow\u201d would displace Britain\u2019s distinct black history. BLM , she says, is a \u201cpolitical\u201d organisation whose protesters used racial slurs towards cops. Tom Hunt, a young Tory MP , accuses its leaders of promoting \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d and \u201cthe abolition of the nuclear family.\u201d"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["s", "tory", "partys", "politics", "black", "party", "mp", "conservative", "stance", "nonwhite", "labour", "britains", "changing", "race"], "pubDate": "2020-10-31T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
