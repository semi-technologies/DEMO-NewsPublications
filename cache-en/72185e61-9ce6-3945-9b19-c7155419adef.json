We've seen plenty of those last few weeks and these mayors and governors shutting places down and going out and doing exactly the opposite of what they say you should do for this virus. But there's no possible way you can do that. He's trying to make himself believe it. I guess he probably believes that. But he obviously hadn't read the Bible too much and hopefully that people see between the lines because it's true politician. That's all they're trying to do, trying to sell you something that's not it. And I think most people in Georgia can read through that. And around the country, it's so important that we we get rid of this abortion law that we're killing a million babies a year. It hurts my soul to believe that all over this world that we kill 50 to 60 million a year and we're all going to pay for it one day. Somebody is going to pay for it when your time's over. But we can let him sell what he wants to, but that's doesn't fly with Christians in the state of Georgia.", "\"Every day when this came out, you're wondering surely to goodness, somebody is going to bring up some kind of special counsel or they can bring Joe Biden to the Senate, put his hand on the Bible and tell what happened and get this out of the way. So we if he does possibly get elected, we don't have to drag the country through this mud again. And unfortunately there's all kind of smoke. You don't really know what's true out there. But just seeing the things that are going on right now, you're just wonder why the media did keep us out of this to a certain point.
