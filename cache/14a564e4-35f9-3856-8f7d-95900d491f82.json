She had gathered a small audience together, and one of the activists who accompanied her urged them to raise their arms in the air and wave \u201cbye-bye\u201d to Trump. \u201cThe celebration is righteous\u2014we should be celebrating,\u201d Bright told me. \u201cBut Trump is also saying he won. And he\u2019s also got fascist thugs in the streets.\u201d (At that moment, Trump was at one of his golf courses, where he\u2019d gone for a morning round.)", "Up the block, Michelle Healy, a longtime organizer for the Service Employees International Union, was part of a group of people wearing S.E.I.U. purple. She\u2019d been out on these streets a number of times in the past few years, she said. She pointed to the spot where she\u2019d stood during a protest against the Trump Administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant families at the border. \u201cTrump created this idea that there is, like, a violent left,\u201d she said. \u201cMy experience is that it has been moms, dads, grandparents, kids.\u201d She looked around. \u201cIt\u2019s all Americans here.\u201d", "Nearby, in the shade of a building, a young man named Rahim\u2014he declined to give his last name\u2014stood with his arms crossed. \u201cPeople just show up for a celebration, but they weren\u2019t here two weeks ago, when we was protesting for our rights,\u201d Rahim said. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird to hear a bunch of white folks yell, \u2018Whose streets? Our streets!\u2019 on Black Lives Matter Plaza because Biden won the election.\u201d Rahim, who is twenty, said he had been helping to organize protests since May, when George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. He\u2019d just voted in a Presidential election for the first time. \u201cIt was cool to vote, but it just sucks that I had to pick between two shitty candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hope people focus on the bigger picture that there\u2019s still work to be done.

Vaca, who was born in Bolivia and lives in Virginia, has two children in the DACA program, and has been involved in organizing for immigrant rights for years. \u201cI breathe, like, democracy today,\u201d she said. \u201cSince Tuesday, I couldn\u2019t sleep. My stomach was tight, thinking, and waiting. Three days ago, when they said that in Pennsylvania Trump was winning\u2014you know, I started to cry again to God because I\u2019m scared a lot. He wanted to deport everybody.\u201d She was holding a homemade sign that read \u201cHere to stay,\u201d and she had one mask layered on top of another. That Biden has pledged to protect the DACA program meant everything to her, because it would help her kids. \u201cI came to this country for a dream,\u201d she said. \u201cI think some of my dream, today, is going to be real.\u201d", "In McPherson Square, in the shadow of the Department of Veterans Affairs, a band was playing in the bed of a truck, and CNN was being projected onto a giant screen. Someone had blown up an inflatable Trump with rodent teeth. Deniz Houston, an American-flag fanny pack worn like a sash across her chest, was standing around with her friends, smiling. \u201cIt feels like we won the World Cup for the first time and defeated Fascism in the same day,\u201d Houston, who is twenty-six, said. \u201cI understand that this feeling might be limited to very select parts of America.
