Sensing that time was running out, he had asked his aides to draw up a list of his political options. He wasn\u2019t especially religious, but, as daylight faded outside the rapidly emptying White House, he fell to his knees and prayed out loud, sobbing as he smashed his fist into the carpet. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d When the President noted that the military could make it easy for him by leaving a pistol in a desk drawer, the chief of staff called the President\u2019s doctors and ordered that all sleeping pills and tranquillizers be taken away from him, to insure that he wouldn\u2019t have the means to kill himself.", "The downfall of Richard Nixon, in the summer of 1974, was, as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein relate in \u201cThe Final Days,\u201d one of the most dramatic in American history. That August, the Watergate scandal forced Nixon\u2014who had been cornered by self-incriminating White House tape recordings, and faced impeachment and removal from office\u2014to resign. Twenty-nine individuals closely tied to his Administration were subsequently indicted, and several of his top aides and advisers, including his Attorney General, John Mitchell, went to prison. Nixon himself, however, escaped prosecution because his successor, Gerald Ford, granted him a pardon, in September, 1974.", "No American President has ever been charged with a criminal offense. But, as Donald Trump fights to hold on to the White House, he and those around him surely know that if he loses\u2014an outcome that nobody should count on\u2014the presumption of immunity that attends the Presidency will vanish. Given that more than a dozen investigations and civil suits involving Trump are currently under way, he could be looking at an endgame even more perilous than the one confronted by Nixon. The Presidential historian Michael Beschloss said of Trump, \u201cIf he loses, you have a situation that\u2019s not dissimilar to that of Nixon when he resigned. Nixon spoke of the cell door clanging shut.\u201d Trump has famously survived one impeachment, two divorces, six bankruptcies, twenty-six accusations of sexual misconduct, and an estimated four thousand lawsuits. Few people have evaded consequences more cunningly. That run of good luck may well end, perhaps brutally, if he loses to Joe Biden. Even if Trump wins, grave legal and financial threats will loom over his second term.", "Two of the investigations into Trump are being led by powerful state and city law-enforcement officials in New York. Cyrus Vance, Jr., the Manhattan District Attorney, and Letitia James, New York\u2019s attorney general, are independently pursuing potential criminal charges related to Trump\u2019s business practices before he became President. Because their jurisdictions lie outside the federal realm, any indictments or convictions resulting from their actions would be beyond the reach of a Presidential pardon. Trump\u2019s legal expenses alone are likely to be daunting. (By the time Bill Clinton left the White House, he\u2019d racked up more than ten million dollars in legal fees.) And Trump\u2019s finances are already under growing strain. During the next four years, according to a stunning recent Times report, Trump\u2014whether re\u00eblected or not\u2014must meet payment deadlines for more than three hundred million dollars in loans that he has personally guaranteed; much of this debt is owed to such foreign creditors as Deutsche Bank. Unless he can refinance with the lenders, he will be on the hook. The Financial Times, meanwhile, estimates that, in all, about nine hundred million dollars\u2019 worth of Trump\u2019s real-estate debt will come due within the next four years. At the same time, he is locked in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over a deduction that he has claimed on his income-tax forms; an adverse ruling could cost him an additional hundred million dollars. To pay off such debts, the President, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be two and a half billion dollars, could sell some of his most valuable real-estate assets\u2014or, as he has in the past, find ways to stiff his creditors. But, according to an analysis by the Washington Post, Trump\u2019s properties\u2014especially his hotels and resorts\u2014have been hit hard by the pandemic and the fallout from his divisive political career. \u201cIt\u2019s the office of the Presidency that\u2019s keeping him from prison and the poorhouse,\u201d Timothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale who studies authoritarianism, told me.", "The White House declined to answer questions for this article, and if Trump has made plans for a post-Presidential life he hasn\u2019t shared them openly. A business friend of his from New York said, \u201cYou can\u2019t broach it with him. He\u2019d be furious at the suggestion that he could lose.\u201d In better times, Trump has revelled in being President. Last winter, a Cabinet secretary told me Trump had confided that he couldn\u2019t imagine returning to his former life as a real-estate developer. As the Cabinet secretary recalled, the two men were gliding along in a motorcade, surrounded by throngs of adoring supporters, when Trump remarked, \u201cIsn\u2019t this incredible? After this, I could never return to ordering windows. It would be so boring.\u201d", "Throughout the 2020 campaign, Trump\u2019s national poll numbers have lagged behind Biden\u2019s, and two sources who have spoken to the President in the past month described him as being in a foul mood. He has testily insisted that he won both Presidential debates, contrary to even his own family\u2019s assessment of the first one. And he has raged not just at the polls and the media but also at some people in charge of his re\u00eblection campaign, blaming them for squandering money and allowing Biden\u2019s team to have a significant financial advantage. Trump\u2019s bad temper was visible on October 20th, when he cut short a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Lesley Stahl. A longtime observer who spent time with him recently told me that he\u2019d never seen Trump so angry.", "The President\u2019s niece Mary Trump\u2014a psychologist and the author of the tell-all memoir \u201cToo Much and Never Enough\u201d\u2014told me that his fury \u201cspeaks to his desperation,\u201d adding, \u201cHe knows that if he doesn\u2019t manage to stay in office he\u2019s in serious trouble. I believe he\u2019ll be prosecuted, because it seems almost undeniable how extensive and long his criminality is. If it doesn\u2019t happen at the federal level, it has to happen at the state level.\u201d She described the \u201cnarcissistic injury\u201d that Trump will suffer if he is rejected at the polls. Within the Trump family, she said, \u201closing was a death sentence\u2014literally and figuratively.\u201d Her father, Fred Trump, Jr., the President\u2019s older brother, \u201cwas essentially destroyed\u201d by her grandfather\u2019s judgment that Fred was not \u201ca winner.\u201d (Fred died in 1981, of complications from alcoholism.) As the President ponders potential political defeat, she believes, he is \u201ca terrified little boy.\u201d", "Barbara Res, whose new book, \u201cTower of Lies,\u201d draws on the eighteen years that she spent, off and on, developing and managing construction projects for Trump, also thinks that the President is not just running for a second term\u2014he is running from the law. \u201cOne of the reasons he\u2019s so crazily intent on winning is all the speculation that prosecutors will go after him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a very scary spectre.\u201d She calculated that, if Trump loses, \u201che\u2019ll never, ever acknowledge it\u2014he\u2019ll leave the country.\u201d Res noted that, at a recent rally, Trump mused to the crowd about fleeing, ad-libbing, \u201cCould you imagine if I lose? I\u2019m not going to feel so good. Maybe I\u2019ll have to leave the country\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d It\u2019s questionable how realistic such talk is, but Res pointed out that Trump could go \u201clive in one of his buildings in another country,\u201d adding, \u201cHe can do business from anywhere.\u201d", "It turns out that, in 2016, Trump in fact made plans to leave the United States right after the vote. Anthony Scaramucci, the former Trump supporter who served briefly as the White House communications director, was with him in the hours before the polls closed. Scaramucci told me that Trump and virtually everyone in his circle had expected Hillary Clinton to win. According to Scaramucci, as he and Trump milled around Trump Tower, Trump asked him, \u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d When Scaramucci said that he had no plans, Trump confided that he had ordered his private plane to be readied for takeoff at John F. Kennedy International Airport, so that the next morning he could fly to Scotland, to play golf at his Turnberry resort. Trump\u2019s posture, Scaramucci told me, was to shrug off the expected defeat. \u201cIt was, like, O.K., he did it for the publicity. And it was over. He was fine. It was a waste of time and money, but move on.\u201d Scaramucci said that, if 2016 is any guide, Trump would treat a loss to Biden more matter-of-factly than many people expect: \u201cHe\u2019ll go down easier than most people think. Nothing crushes this guy.\u201d", "Mary Trump, like Res, suspects that her uncle is considering leaving the U.S. if he loses the election (a result that she regards as far from assured). If Biden wins, she suggested, Trump will \u201cdescribe himself as the best thing that ever happened to this country and say, \u2018It doesn\u2019t deserve me\u2014I\u2019m going to do something really important, like build the Trump Tower in Moscow.\u2019 \u201d", "The notion that a former American President would go into exile\u2014like a disgraced king or a deposed despot\u2014sounds almost absurd, even in this heightened moment, and many close observers of the President, including Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter of Trump\u2019s first best-seller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d dismiss the idea. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s terrified,\u201d Schwartz told me. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll leave the country. Where the hell would he go?\u201d However, Snyder, the Yale professor, whose specialty is antidemocratic regimes in Eastern Europe, believes that Trump might well abscond to a foreign country that has no extradition treaty with the U.S. \u201cUnless you\u2019re an idiot, you have that flight plan ready,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s telling me he\u2019ll have a show on Fox News. I think he\u2019ll have a show on RT\u201d\u2014the Russian state television network.", "\u201cWe decided to combine Halloween and Thanksgiving this year.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Carolita Johnson", "In Snyder\u2019s view, such desperate maneuverings would not have been necessary had Trump been a more adept autocrat. Although the President has recently made various authoritarian gestures\u2014in June, he threatened to deploy the military against protesters, and in July he talked about delaying the election\u2014Snyder contends that Trump\u2019s predicament \u201cis that he hasn\u2019t ruined our system enough.\u201d Snyder explained, \u201cGenerally, autocrats will distort the system as far as necessary to stay in power. Usually, it means warping democracy before they get to where Trump is now.\u201d For an entrenched autocrat, an election is mere theatre\u2014but the conclusion of the Trump-Biden race remains unpredictable, despite concerns about voter suppression, disputed ballot counts, and civil unrest.", "On Election Day, the margin of victory may be crucial in determining Trump\u2019s future. If the winner\u2019s advantage in the Electoral College is decisive, neither side will be able to easily dispute the result. But several of Trump\u2019s former associates told me that if there is any doubt at all\u2014no matter how questionable\u2014the President will insist that he has won. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former attorney, told me, \u201cHe will not concede. Never, ever, ever.\u201d He went on, \u201cI believe he\u2019s going to challenge the validity of the vote in each and every state he loses\u2014claiming ballot fraud, seeking to undermine the process and invalidate it.\u201d Cohen thinks that the recent rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court was motivated in part by Trump\u2019s hope that a majority of Justices would take his side in a disputed election.", "Cohen, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to lying to Congress and to various financial crimes, including making an illegal contribution to Trump\u2019s Presidential campaign, has faced questions about his credibility. But he affirmed, \u201cI have heard that Trump people have been speaking to lawyers all over the country, taking their temperatures on this topic.\u201d One of Trump\u2019s personal attorneys, the Supreme Court litigator William Consovoy, has initiated legal actions across the nation challenging mail-in voting, on behalf of the Republican Party, the Trump campaign, and a dark-money group that calls itself the Honest Elections Project. And a former Trump White House official, Mike Roman, who has made a career of whipping up fear about nonwhite voter fraud, has assumed the role of field general of a volunteer fleet of poll watchers who refer to themselves as the Army for Trump.", "Cohen is so certain that Trump will lose that he recently placed a ten-thousand-dollar bet on it. \u201cHe\u2019ll blame everyone except for himself,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cEvery day, he\u2019ll rant and rave and yell and scream about how they stole the Presidency from him. He\u2019ll say he won by millions and millions of ballots, and they cheated with votes from dead people and people who weren\u2019t born yet. He\u2019ll tell all sorts of lies and activate his militias. It\u2019s going to be a pathetic show. But, by stacking the Supreme Court, he\u2019ll think he can get an injunction. Trump repeats his lies over and over with the belief that the more he tells them the more people will believe them. We all wish he\u2019d just shut up, but the problem is he won\u2019t.\u201d", "Schwartz agreed that Trump \u201cwill do anything to make the case he didn\u2019t lose,\u201d and noted that one of Trump\u2019s strengths has been his refusal to admit failure, which means that \u201cwhen he wins he wins, and when he loses he also wins.\u201d But if Trump loses by a landslide, Schwartz said, \u201che\u2019ll have many fewer cards to play. He won\u2019t be able to play the election-was-stolen-from-me card\u2014and that\u2019s a big one.\u201d", "It\u2019s hard to imagine a former U.S. President behind bars or being forced to perform community service, as the former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was, after being convicted of tax fraud. Yet some of the legal threats aimed at Trump are serious. The case that Vance\u2019s office, in Manhattan, is pursuing appears to be particularly strong. According to court documents from the prosecution of Cohen, he didn\u2019t act alone. Cohen\u2019s case centered on his payment of hush money to the porn star Stormy Daniels, with whom the President allegedly had a sexual liaison. The government claimed that Cohen\u2019s scheme was assisted by an unindicted co-conspirator whom federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York referred to as \u201cIndividual-1,\u201d and who ran \u201can ultimately successful campaign for President of the United States.\u201d", "Clearly, this was a reference to Trump. But, because in recent decades the Justice Department has held that a sitting President can\u2019t be prosecuted, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office wrapped up its case after Cohen\u2019s conviction. Vance appears to have picked up where the U.S. Attorney left off.", "The direction of Vance\u2019s inquiry can be gleaned from Cohen\u2019s sentencing memo: it disclosed that, during the 2016 Presidential campaign, Cohen set up a shell company that paid a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to Daniels. The Trump Organization disguised the hush-money payment as \u201clegal expenses.\u201d But the government argued that the money, which bought her silence, was an illegal campaign contribution: it helped Trump\u2019s candidacy, by suppressing damaging facts, and far exceeded the federal donation limit of twenty-seven hundred dollars. Moreover, because the payment was falsely described as legal expenses, New York laws prohibiting the falsification of business records may have been violated. Such crimes are usually misdemeanors, but if they are committed in furtherance of other offenses, such as tax fraud, they can become felonies. Court documents stated that Cohen \u201cacted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1\u201d\u2014an allegation that Trump has vehemently denied.", "It has become clear that the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s investigation involves more than the Stormy Daniels case. Secrecy surrounds Vance\u2019s grand-jury probe, but a well-informed source told me that it now includes a hard-hitting exploration of potentially illegal self-dealing in Trump\u2019s financial practices. In an August court filing, the D.A.\u2019s office argued that it should be allowed to subpoena Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax records, explaining that it is now investigating \u201cpossibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization.\u201d The prosecutors didn\u2019t specify what the grand jury was looking into, but they cited news stories detailing possible tax fraud, insurance fraud, and \u201cschemes to defraud,\u201d which is how New York penal law addresses bank fraud. As the Times\u2019 recent reports on Trump\u2019s tax records show, he has long made aggressive, and potentially fraudulent, use of accounting gimmicks to all but eliminate his income-tax burden. One minor but revealing detail is that he deducted seventy thousand dollars for hair styling, which ordinarily is a personal expense. At the same time, according to congressional testimony that Cohen gave last year, Trump has provided insurance companies with inflated income statements, in effect keeping two sets of books: one stating losses, for the purpose of taxes, the other exaggerating profits, for business purposes. Trump\u2019s lawyers have consistently refused to disclose his tax records, fighting subpoenas in both the circuit courts and the Supreme Court. Trump has denied any financial wrongdoing, and has denounced efforts to scrutinize his tax returns as \u201ca continuation of the worst witch hunt in American history.\u201d But his legal team has lost every round in the courts, and may be running out of arguments. It\u2019s possible that New York\u2019s legal authorities will back off. Even a Trump critic such as Scaramucci believes that \u201cit\u2019s too much of a strain on the system to put an American President in jail.\u201d But a former top official in New York suggested to me that Vance and James are unlikely to abandon their investigations if Trump loses on November 3rd, if only because it would send an unwanted message: \u201cIf you\u2019re Tish James or Cy Vance and you drop the case the moment he\u2019s out of office, you\u2019re admitting it was political.\u201d"], "authors": ["Jane Mayer", "Jane Maye"], "keywords": ["president", "legal", "scaramucci", "tax", "afford", "dollars", "told", "hell", "trump", "trumps", "white", "lose", "cant"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
