They have included ragged, folksy home recordings; propulsive, glossy rock; children\u2019s music featuring singing frogs; covers of fifties R. & B. favorites; duets with Carl Perkins, Michael Jackson, and Stevie Wonder; collaborations with members of Led Zeppelin and the Royal Liverpool Symphony Orchestra; and excursions into disco, ambient techno, and cut-and-paste soundscapes. By comparison, the Beatles released only twelve full studio albums\u2014about nine hours of music. They made statements with their records, but McCartney seems to be perpetually sketching, pursuing a career of whims and compulsions. In 1971, he and his then wife, Linda, formed a new band, Wings, perhaps so that their family could spend more time together. \u201cIt was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong, big deal,\u201d he said. He characterized an album in the eighties as having started as \u201ca mess-around.\u201d Even when he compiled \u201cPure McCartney,\u201d a 2016 retrospective of his post-Beatles career, he shrugged off any grand purpose, saying that it was simply \u201csomething fun to listen to.\u201d No doubt McCartney takes his craft and his career seriously. But he\u2019s a living legend who seems less interested in tending to his legacy than in scratching a chronic itch.", "He recorded his solo d\u00e9but in secret, in 1969 and 1970. The Beatles were in the process of disbanding, and he was reportedly sullen; the album, called \u201cMcCartney,\u201d is a breakup record, though its heartache manifests less in the songs\u2019 lyrics than in their tattered edges. The record is filled with gorgeous half-finished melodies that eschew the perfectionism to which Beatles fans had grown accustomed, baffling listeners. \u201cThe Lovely Linda,\u201d for example, starts off as a pretty ode to his wife but then ends suddenly, as McCartney dissolves into giggles. In the eighties, as Wings was breaking up, McCartney recorded a sequel, \u201cMcCartney II,\u201d on which he ditched rock classicism for synthesizers and drum machines. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t a masterpiece, he told an interviewer, but it was \u201ctotal freedom.\u201d", "This year, as the pandemic swept across the world, McCartney and his family retreated to his farm in East Sussex. He turned his prodigious work ethic to home recording and started tinkering with a scrap of a song he\u2019d begun in the nineties. He ended up with an entire album, \u201cMcCartney III,\u201d which comes out on December 18th. The opener, \u201cLong Tailed Winter Bird,\u201d summarizes the one-man approach. He begins by casually strumming his guitar, almost as if he\u2019s tuning it, and then works out a raga-like pattern. He adds layers: a friendly bass line, background coos, electric guitar, pounding drums, strings and woodwinds. It goes on a bit longer than necessary, as if he were just noodling around. \u201cDeep Deep Feeling\u201d opens with McCartney riffing about the highs and lows of love, exhausting the rhyming possibilities of the word \u201cemotion\u201d with \u201cdevotion,\u201d \u201cocean,\u201d and \u201cmotion.\u201d He adds an ethereal synth line, a stretched-out blues guitar; together, the instruments convey a storminess that his words never quite capture.", "In the popular imagination of the Beatles, John Lennon was the anguished, hard-driving dreamer, the one plumbing his psychological depths or reaching for the impossible vision. McCartney was the simpler one: he was congenial and silly, pathological only about songwriting. He came up with melodies and left them unfinished because there were always more to write. There are a few moments of \u201cMcCartney III\u201d that recall this sense of delight. \u201cLavatory Lil,\u201d a trifling blues boogie, echoes the childish, character-driven songs of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cAbbey Road.\u201d", "Since the nineties, many of McCartney\u2019s albums have been produced in a way that seems conscious of his glory days, and his effect on British music. Sometimes it sounds as though he were singing over a simulacrum of a Beatles song, and at other times as though he were sharing in the fun of disciples like Oasis or Adele. The most affecting moments of \u201cMcCartney III\u201d are when his age and his limitations show. (He\u2019s seventy-eight.) He works his way through a lovely acoustic ballad called \u201cThe Kiss of Venus\u201d slowly and gingerly, his voice carefully tracing an ascending guitar line. On \u201cWomen and Wives,\u201d he sounds warbly, as though he were losing control of his instrument. \u201cWhen tomorrow comes around / You\u2019ll be looking at the future,\u201d he sings sternly. \u201cSo keep your feet upon the ground / And get ready to run.\u201d", "A few years ago, there was a trollish online debate about whether the Atlanta rap trio Migos was better than the Beatles. A version of it took place in my college dorm in the nineties; the challenger then was Boyz II Men. I\u2019ve since decided that there is no way for the upstart to win this argument. One gets the sense that it simply entrenches the Beatles as a cultural monolith. Invoking their name connects us to the possibility of some universally agreed-upon standard of greatness, a kind of consensus that no longer seems within reach.", "In this way, McCartney can sometimes seem like a symbol rather than a person. Currently, his most streamed song on Spotify is \u201cFourFiveSeconds,\u201d a 2015 track featuring Rihanna and Kanye West. (It has seven hundred million listens, nearly two hundred million more than \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201d) Kanye and Rihanna are the stars of the song; McCartney\u2019s presence seems gestural, a way for them to link themselves to the canon. But McCartney appears to relish these brushes with the Zeitgeist. In 2016, when Rae Sremmurd\u2019s \u201cBlack Beatles\u201d (streamed a hundred and thirty million more times than \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d) became the soundtrack for a viral \u201cmannequin\u201d challenge, McCartney took part, filming a video of himself frozen while playing a grand piano. \u201cLove those Black Beatles,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. In recent years, McCartney has sung on a track by the E.D.M. producer the Bloody Beetroots and performed with the surviving members of Nirvana. He is on this month\u2019s cover of Rolling Stone, alongside Taylor Swift. Such moments give younger artists a bridge to history; McCartney satisfies his curiosity about kids these days.", "But it may be impossible for a septuagenarian ex-Beatle to grasp the anxiety-filled world that his musical descendants have inherited. The pandemic has provided an occasion for younger artists, including Taylor Swift, Charli XCX, and BTS, to release work that touches on the isolation and loneliness of contemporary life. By contrast, there\u2019s something incredibly \u201cPaul\u201d about McCartney\u2019s approach to the pandemic album: cheery, resilient, forever looking forward. It\u2019s a reminder of one of the Beatles\u2019 most powerful messages to baby boomers: life gets better. It\u2019s getting better all the time.", "McCartney\u2019s optimism feels vintage. In \u201cSeize the Day,\u201d he reminds us, over warm electric keys, to stay in the moment: \u201cWhen the cold days come / When the old ways fade away / There\u2019ll be no more sun / And we\u2019ll wish that we had held on to the day.\u201d For the album\u2019s splendid closer, \u201cWinter Bird\u2014When Winter Comes,\u201d he returns to the album\u2019s opening guitar lick. The song then morphs into a folk tune that doubles as a to-do list of tasks around his farm: fix a fence, dig a drain, plant some trees. Time passes, he notes, and someday the trees will cast shade. The implication is that McCartney won\u2019t be around to see them, but, by doing his part, he has helped a future visitor. The sentiment is lovely, and it harks back to a different generation\u2019s sense of what\u2019s possible. We\u2019d all like to believe that love will prevail, that the earth will heal itself, and that we\u2019ll leave things better than we found them. He\u2019s written this song countless times. But it sounds a little different now. \u2666"], "authors": ["Hua Hsu", "Hua Hs"], "keywords": ["guitar", "pandemic", "albums", "comes", "better", "mccartney", "hes", "surprisingly", "album", "song", "paul", "beatles", "way", "playful", "mccartneys"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
