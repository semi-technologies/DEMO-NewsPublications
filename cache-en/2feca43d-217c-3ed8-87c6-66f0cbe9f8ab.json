This is the rocket that Elon Musk hopes will soon carry humans to the moon and, eventually, to Mars, but Wednesday\u2019s launch was an uncrewed test flight that lasted just a few minutes. The rocket flew to an altitude of 40,000 feet\u2014roughly the cruising altitude of a commercial airliner\u2014and performed what Musk has called a \u201cbelly flop\u201d maneuver on its way back to earth. The rocket executed a controlled descent to the surface and righted itself just a few hundred feet above the ground. But it wasn\u2019t able to slow its descent enough to safely touch down, and it exploded spectacularly near the landing pad. While the rocket made it only about a tenth of the way to space and didn\u2019t survive the landing attempt, it\u2019s still a major step toward a first orbital mission and a big win for Musk\u2019s interplanetary ambitions.", "SpaceX\u2019s Starship looks like it was ripped straight from the pages of a pulp science fiction novel. Its gleaming, bullet-shaped silver hull is a patchwork of stainless steel plates. Two triangular fins protrude from its lower half, with two smaller fins near its tip. Starship is huge\u201415 stories from engine to nose cone\u2014but it is only the upper stage of a still larger rocket called the Super Heavy. This booster is a scaled-up version of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket and will come equipped with three times as many engines. When SpaceX mates a Falcon Super Heavy booster and Starship, the entire ensemble will stand nearly 400 feet tall. It will be just a few feet taller than NASA\u2019s Saturn V rocket that carried humans to the moon, which remains the largest and most powerful rocket that has ever flown to space.", "Both the Super Heavy and Starship will use SpaceX\u2019s new Raptor rocket engines, which are far more powerful than the Merlin engines that the company currently uses on all of its Falcon rockets. SpaceX has flown a Raptor engine on just two occasions, both during test flights for Starhopper, a scaled-down version of Starship that looked more like a grain silo than a rocket. Each Starhopper flight carried only a single engine and boosted the vehicle a few hundred feet in the air. During Wednesday\u2019s test flight, the Starship prototype carried three Raptor engines and was the first time that a SpaceX rocket has flown more than one at the same time. One of the Raptor engines cut out about 2 minutes into the flight, and the second cut out shortly thereafter. It\u2019s unclear whether those engines were intentionally shut down or malfunctioned during the flight. When Starship is ready to head to space, it will carry six Raptors\u2014three optimized for flying through the atmosphere and three optimized for the vacuum of space\u2014and the Super Heavy booster will be powered by 28 Raptor engines."], "authors": ["Daniel Oberhaus", "Daniel Oberhau"], "keywords": ["starship", "rocket", "flight", "mars", "spacex", "raptor", "engines", "super", "heavy", "test", "launchesand", "crashesits", "feet"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
