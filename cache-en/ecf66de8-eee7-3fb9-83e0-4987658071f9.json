One of the few upsides to this stupid year is that people are cooking at home with more regularity, and the knock-on effect is that butter sales are soaring. In the US, butter production has returned to levels last seen in 1943. This is brilliant news, because it gives us all an excuse to cook massively butter-heavy dishes again. It\u2019s worth pointing out that none of these can even remotely be considered health food. But that\u2019s by the by, because they are all very delicious.", "Semolina gnocchi with butter, parmesan and sage", "Rachel Roddy has a gnocchi recipe that doubles as an opportunity to gorge yourself silly on butter. The gnocchi itself is made with semolina, rather than potatoes, that is first enriched with butter and cheese before being baked in \u2013 that\u2019s right \u2013 even more butter and cheese. \u201cThis is not a dish you see very often in trattorias,\u201d Roddy writes, \u201cbut it is one that lives on in homes and deserves to be better known\u201d.", "Butter chicken", "A buttery classic ... Gymkhana\u2019s chicken masala. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian", "Then, of course, there is murg makhani, or butter chicken. Discovered by accident by a Delhi restaurant after leftover chicken was mixed into a buttery tomato sauce, the dish has since become a classic. Gymkhana\u2019s recipe for chicken butter masala is the perfect example, rich with ginger and chilli and thickened with almond paste. If you want to add even more butter, do as the Australians do and put a great big buttery pastry lid on top.", "Extra-buttery mashed potatoes", "There is some debate about the maximum amount of butter you can add to mashed potatoes. My mum, for example, would scrimp and use the merest sliver, but there are sites that recommend a whopping, Escoffier style 1:1 ratio of butter to potato. A happy middle ground can be reached thanks to Bon Appetit\u2019s Dawn Perry, who uses 340g of butter for every 1.8kg of potatoes she cooks. With the addition of about 350ml (a cup and half) of whole milk, this is enough to make the spuds qualify as \u201cextra buttery\u201d.", "Buttery onion soup", "French onion soup ... some soups are richer than others. Photograph: Sergii Koval/Alamy Stock Photo", "French onion soup is another sterling outlet for your surplus butter. The trick is to find the right recipe. While some will call for a mere smattering of the stuff \u2013 I\u2019ve seen some recipes require just 50g per kilo of onions \u2013 the Epicurious recipe for buttery onion soup is another matter entirely. Scale it up and it would require close to 500g of butter per kilo of onions. As if you need to be told, this is quite rich.", "Brioche loaf", "If the prospect of baking your own bread doesn\u2019t fill you with terrifying flashbacks of the spring lockdown, then it might be a nice idea to try your hand at Dan Lepard\u2019s brioche recipe. It\u2019s extremely messy and nightmarishly difficult \u2013 he promises an exasperated \u201coh my goodness\u201d moment in the middle of the butter addition phase \u2013 but if you persevere, the rewards are rich and decadent.", "Shortbread", "If you\u2019d rather direct your butter mountain towards something more biscuity, Nigel Slater\u2019s shortbread recipe seems like a decent enough outlet. Not only does he use a tremendous amount, he also browns it first. Heat your butter for five minutes until the colour changes, then return it to the fridge to harden and you\u2019re left with something that, as Slater says, \u201cbrings all its sweetness to the fore\u201d.", "Sable cookies", "But perhaps the satisfying heft of shortbread is not for you. If you\u2019d prefer something a little more delicate, but no less buttery, Martha Stewart\u2019s sables should do the trick. Stewart says that the biscuits are \u201cdelicious plain, dipped in dark chocolate, or sandwiched with jam\u201d. Best of all, the quantities in her recipe makes more than 100 biscuits.", "Apple charlotte", "Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect apple charlotte recipe uses a comparatively small amount of butter, but it\u2019s important to note how the butter is used. Some of it, as you would expect, is used to cook the apples. The rest of it is melted, tipped into a baking tray and used to soak eight slices of bread to saturation point. Imagine.", "German butter cake", "It\u2019s German, and it\u2019s full of butter ... German butter cake. Photograph: Bjorn Wylezich/Alamy Stock Photo", "And then there\u2019s butterkuchen, perhaps my favourite recipe here. Served at weddings and funerals in north Germany, it is sometimes called Freud-und-Leid-Kuchen (joy and sorrow cake), and is made with a yeast dough. Once the dough is rolled out into a pan, you poke dozens of holes into it, then fill the holes with cubes of butter before cooking. Joy (butter!) and sorrow (probably a heart attack) await.", "Hot buttered rum", "Winter warmer ... a hot buttered rum cocktail. Photograph: JoanieSimon/Getty Images/iStockphoto", "Finally, if by some miracle you still have any butter left after all this \u2013 and you don\u2019t fancy giving Nigella\u2019s double-buttered toast a try \u2013 you should probably just tip it into some booze. Jamie Oliver\u2019s recipe for hot buttered rum is a textbook example of the form. Spiced, sweetened, melted butter and a hard hit of alcohol.
