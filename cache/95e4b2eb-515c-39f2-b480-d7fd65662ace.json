Cities and countries across the world may simply cease to exist in a 3C world [which is where current climate commitments would lead]. So we must redouble our efforts before we pass the point of no return.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ban Ki-moon, the former UN secretary general, says the world must redouble its efforts or we will pass the point of no return.

That has been postponed to next November, while governments grapple with the coronavirus.", "The first stage of the pandemic crisis focused on staving off economic collapse, as lockdowns were imposed by governments, starting in China and moving swiftly around the world in the spring. These unprecedented shutdowns sent greenhouse gas emissions plunging, but created economic chaos which countries have been scrambling to repair.", "Within the next few months, leaders must shift to a more sustainable model, promoting low-carbon economies to provide jobs and clean growth, instead of cementing high-carbon infrastructure into the recovery \u2013 which would mean losing hope of meeting the Paris goals, Ban warned.", "\u201cI have been urging world leaders \u2013 it is absolutely OK, it\u2019s only necessary that they spend money to resuscitate their economy [but] at the same time, they should never put climate ambition back,\u201d said Ban. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that most of the important priorities have been focused only on Covid-19.\u201d", "Economists argue that building a green recovery will provide jobs quickly, to counter the sharp rise in unemployment resulting from the lockdowns. Insulating homes, installing solar panels and other renewable energy, extending broadband, remodelling cities to make them easier to walk and cycle, planting trees and building flood defences: all are needed to reset national economies on to a low-carbon footing, and all are labour-intensive. While governments are spending trillions to resolve the crisis, this would be spending that also helps to secure a low-carbon and prosperous future.", "Countries could still turn themselves around, Ban said, pointing to the announcement by China\u2019s president Xi Jinping that the world\u2019s biggest emitter would for the first time adopt a net zero target, for 2060, and ensure its emissions peaked before 2030. This was followed by a commitment to net zero by 2050 by Japan\u2019s new prime minister and by South Korea\u2019s government.", "\u201cThis is an extraordinary, remarkable decision by the Chinese government,\u201d said Ban. \u201cSo many countries are now joining with the strong political will to realise net zero by 2050. We might have lost some time but this is the time to really resuscitate and regain the political will. I think we can do it.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, says what is needed is a \u2018clean energy and economic recovery plan\u2019.

They can do this by putting forward an ambitious climate target for 2030 and encouraging all other nations to make similar commitments.\u201d", "For governments facing economic disaster in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, the prospect of making bold spending commitments for a green recovery might seem daunting. But the alternative would be to see a long period of recession with all the discontent and hardship that would entail, warned Lord Nicholas Stern, the climate economist and chair of the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics.", "\u201cMy worry is that there would be a really long period of recession, where nothing much happens, and political and social tensions would rise,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is so important to try to get out of this in a good way. It would be a terrible step backwards if we went back to austerity.\u201d"], "authors": ["Fiona Harvey"], "keywords": ["target", "climate", "global", "recovery", "world", "zero", "running", "net", "warn", "governments", "green", "energy", "experts"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
