Kristi Noem urged the country to \u201cafford the 70.6 million Americans that voted for President Trump the same consideration\" provided to former vice president Al Gore in the 2000 legal battle that resulted in a Supreme Court decision and a George W. Bush victory.", "In a Sunday interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\", the Republican governor argued that President Trump should be allowed \"his day in court,\" pointing to Gore's 37-day legal effort to challenge the results of an election too close to call on Election Night.", "CRUZ INSISTS TRUMP STILL HAS PATH TO VICTORY, CLAIMS VOTE COUNT LAWSUITS COULD 'EASILY' REACH SUPREME COURT", "\"What I think is going on here, George, is that this is all premature. This is a premature conversation because we have not finished counting votes,\" Noem said. \"There are states that have not been called, and back in 2000, Al Gore was given his day in court.
