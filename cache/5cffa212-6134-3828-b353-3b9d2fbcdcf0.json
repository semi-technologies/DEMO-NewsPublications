However, they\u2019ve all fallen short of the core game\u2019s appeal in different ways \u2013 whether it was Duels\u2019 lack of staying power or Magic: The Gathering Online\u2019s exclusive focus on hardcore players and a 1:1 pricing with physical model. With Magic: The Gathering Arena, there\u2019s finally a Magic product that truly embraces the digital age, offering both casual fun and competitive card-slinging.", "If you know the current standard landscape of the game (i.e. the last few years of sets), it\u2019s all here. While the presentation and layout are full of bells and whistles \u2013 talking cards, streamlined land-tapping, flashy enter-the-battlefield effects for mythic cards \u2013 it\u2019s still the tabletop game you know and love. Games play faster, in part due to taking the human element out of rote tasks like shuffling decks, placing and removing counters on cards, and cleaning up tokens. The digital nature of the game also allows for some special formats that wouldn\u2019t be possible in physical space. For instance, Momir format allows you to summon random creatures \u2013 a fun (and not necessarily competitive) way to enjoy the digital-only format.", "As with all things Magic, it\u2019s about what you can play and when. If you\u2019re feeling like you want to do a draft, you can anytime, assuming you have the currency. If you just want to get in and play, Arena does a great job at providing a multitude of free decks and cards. The model isn\u2019t overbearing, but if you want to have a suite of competitive decks, you'll need to shell out money. Card acquisition is fairly accommodating, but drafts and tournaments are locked behind large sums of earned currency or paid entries. This means if you get into the game and take it seriously, you will almost certainly be paying, but the costs feel reasonable.", "Sealed deck events, limited-time events like singleton (only allowing one copy of any card), or special tournaments with varying rules are constantly available and cycling, ensuring you have multiple offerings to engage with every time you log on. Card packs also offer something not present in the physical game: wild cards. You can pull and trade these for any card you like of the associated rarity \u2013 a major boon when you\u2019re trying to get a playset of a critical mythic rare for your competitive deck.", "However, you\u2019re not able to play or obtain cards from most of Magic's long history. If you want to play with your favorite fungi from Fallen Empires or mass a kobold army from Legends, you\u2019re out of luck. The social features are noticeably lacking \u2013 you can duel with friends, but it\u2019s far easier to play against random opponents in ladder play. Arena also currently lacks some of the favorite social formats, such as Commander/Elder Dragon Highlander or Cube draft, but these are mostly forgivable omissions.", "If you\u2019re looking to play Magic, there\u2019s probably no better way than Magic: The Gathering Arena, and that says a lot. Wizards of the Coast seemed hesitant to move all-in on a digital product in the last decade, perhaps out of fear that it could cannibalize the gigantic paper audience, but Magic is finally where it needs to be in the digital space.", ""]}
