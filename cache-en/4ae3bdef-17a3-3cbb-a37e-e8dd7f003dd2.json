But dogs never do. They don\u2019t understand that every sound in a word is important.", "How do we even know this about dogs? Presumably we can\u2019t ask them. Researchers at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest attached electrodes to the heads of dogs of different ages, and then played them some recorded words.", "And what did they find? That while dogs are capable of distinguishing between understood commands and nonsense words that sound different, they are not so good at distinguishing between similar-sounding words.", "You mean they can\u2019t actually hear the difference? It is more to do with processing power. \u201cSimilarly to the case of human infants, we speculate that the similarity of dogs\u2019 brain activity for instruction words they know and for similar nonsense words reflects not perceptual constraints but attentional and processing biases,\u201d said the study\u2019s author Attila Andics.", "Sorry?

It might be a stretch to infer that from this particular study.", "And when he\u2019s looking at me like that, it\u2019s just because he\u2019s hardwired to recognise human faces? No. Another recent study indicated that dogs also don\u2019t share our particular ability to recognise faces. They tend to go by your general outline and your smell.", "In short, all dogs are morons.
