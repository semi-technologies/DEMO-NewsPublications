(The importance of family, though, they get spot-on.) Vin Diesel\u2019s Plymouth GTX shouldn\u2019t be able to yank two cars into each other so hard that they flatten into pancakes\u2014but it does. Spinning out a competitor by knocking into them is just as likely to give you a flat tire as it is to land you in first place. What you might not know\u2014and what Wyatt Knox is happy to explain to you\u2014is what elements of reality, precisely, are being ignored.", "Knox is a former rally racing champion, but also an instructor at the Team O\u2019Neil driving school in New Hampshire. And so when he watches some of cinema\u2019s wildest driving scenes, he does more than break down what\u2019s realistic (the footwork in Baby Driver, James Bond\u2019s corkscrew jump in The Man With the Golden Gun) and what\u2019s not (the footwork in The Transporter, James Bond\u2019s Aston Martin punching through another car in Spectre).", "In the latest edition of WIRED\u2019s Technique Critique, Knox tells you how to pull off such moves better than the actors (and stunt drivers). If you\u2019re going to launch your Dodge Charger into the air, keep both hands on the wheel, unlike Bo Duke. Yes, the Mini Cooper is a great car for going down stairs, but slow down on the approach, lest you flip over. If you insist on using wheel spikes to gnash your competitors\u2019 tires, make them out of high-strength steel\u2014aluminum\u2019s not up to the task. As the family in Vacation learned the terrifying way, handbrake turns don\u2019t work well in minivans. If you want to learn how to properly spin your ride around, it\u2019s best to tap Knox for a real-life lesson.
