The easiest way for trainers to harness watts is by locating the different Max Raid pads in the Wild Area. Even if there\u2019s not a Pok\u00e9mon to battle, players can retrieve a varied number of watts from each pad.

However, not every Galarian monster holds that sweet, sweet wattage. Throughout the Wild Area and varied routes, players will stumble upon Pok\u00e9mon emanating a yellow glow of energy that signifies that they\u2019re coursing with watts.
