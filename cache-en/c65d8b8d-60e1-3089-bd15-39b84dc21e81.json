On Monday eight people were reportedly arrested by the national security police over a small and peaceful student rally at the Chinese University of Hong Kong last month, including three accused of breaching the national security law.", "Hui left Hong Kong for Denmark last week, before announcing that he and his family would not return.

Hui called on HSBC to clarify its comments about misrepresentation, saying his family had made complaints and kept records of dealings with the bank. \u201cUnder the National Security Law, how much are the banks and the business sector willing to sacrifice for the service of the regime?\u201d he said.", "Hui earlier said the alleged asset freezings reflected what banks could do \u201cas a result of political pressure\u201d, and this affected the credibility of Hong Kong as an international banking and finance hub.

The Hang Sen Index dropped more than 2% on open on Monday.", "Johnny Patterson, policy director at UK-based Hong Kong Watch, said the alleged freezing of Hui\u2019s accounts was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d and he accused HSBC of bowing to Beijing\u2019s strategy of economic coercion.", "", "\u201cIt forms part of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s alarming strategy to eradicate dissent in Hong Kong using every lever available from asset freezes to trumped up lawsuits.
