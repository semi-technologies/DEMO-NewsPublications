How bad will Trumpism after Trump be? \u201cSeventy-two million people is a lot of people,\u201d President-elect Joe Biden noted this week, in an interview with the Times\u2019 Thomas L. Friedman, referring to Trump\u2019s electorate in 2020. But, when Trump departs, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that ugliness stays,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere may be twenty percent of it. Twenty-five percent of it, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "We can be confident, as Biden is, that the great majority of Trump voters in 2020 are not irrevocably committed to Trumpism; many of them, for example, would just prefer to have Republicans running the economy. And asking how the forms of populist politics that Trump has exploited and stoked will evolve after his Presidency is different from asking what will become of Trump himself. The President may imagine that he can remain the sole and powerful master of his following after January\u2014and, perhaps, to strengthen his grip, he will even announce a pre\u00ebmptive campaign for the White House in 2024, as he has mused privately about doing. Yet he cannot deny a reality: generally, ex-Presidents lose power very quickly. (Think of Bill Clinton in 2000, even before he left the White House, unable to persuade Al Gore, his own Vice-President, to give him a meaningful role in Gore\u2019s campaign against George W. Bush.) Trump had no inkling what it was like to be President before he won the office, in 2016. Come February, he may be stunned again, this time by the speed at which former loyalists distance themselves.", "Of course, Trump may again prove to be a mold-breaker. It\u2019s not as if the Republican Party is likely to stand up to him. The complicity of the Party\u2019s national leadership since Election Day, as Trump has recklessly promoted baseless allegations of voting fraud, is both a measure of his residual ability to intimidate and a shocking snapshot of a debased G.O.P. establishment, which seems to have lost much of its muscle memory from the time before Trump. Even so, electoral politics is a ruthless zero-sum game. Trump failed decisively to be re\u00eblected, becoming the first sitting President to meet that fate in nearly three decades. As Trump himself might put it: when you\u2019re a loser, people can treat you like a dog.", "Editor\u2019s Picks", "Trump\u2019s charisma, such as it is, synthesizes the rudeness and the faux \u201cauthenticity\u201d of recent reality television with the racialized and nativist rhetoric that dates from way back in our history. He has drawn inspiration from such disparate populist figures as Joseph McCarthy, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jesse (the Body) Ventura, the professional wrestler who, in 1999, was elected governor of Minnesota. Trump\u2019s most important predecessor, however, was probably George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, who ran four times for the White House and became \u201cthe first serious presidential candidate in the twentieth century who identified himself as a working man,\u201d as the historian Michael Kazin writes in \u201cThe Populist Persuasion,\u201d an essential history of American populist rhetoric and personalities on both the right and the left.", "Wallace\u2019s unapologetic racism and his summoning of the economic and cultural grievances of \u201cthe common man\u201d accelerated the Republican Party\u2019s embrace of the Deep South as an electoral base after the sixties, and such populist resentment is the foundation on which Trump constructed his rise to the White House. At the apex of Wallace\u2019s appeal, during the Presidential campaign of 1968, when he competed as an independent against Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, he championed factory workers, barbers, and policemen while denouncing \u201cpointy-headed college professors,\u201d Communists, and Wall Street money men. He exhorted his followers, \u201cYes, they\u2019ve looked down their nose at you and me for a long time\u2014the Republicans and Democrats. Well, we\u2019re going to show them there are a lot of rednecks in this country!\u201d", "Wallace won five states that November and captured fourteen per cent of the national popular vote; Nixon won a narrow plurality over Humphrey, attracting just over forty-three per cent nationwide. Wallace lost to Nixon by slight margins in Tennessee and North Carolina. Because of the vagaries of the Electoral College, if Wallace had won either of those states, and if Humphrey had overcome a narrow margin of defeat in Ohio, Nixon would have failed to win the Electoral College, throwing the contest to the House of Representatives. (Wallace was polling even higher over the summer, but then he selected as his running mate the retired Air Force general and strategic-bombing enthusiast Curtis LeMay, who, at his d\u00e9but press conference, lamented the public\u2019s \u201cphobia about nuclear weapons\u201d and argued that there were times \u201cwhen it would be most efficient\u201d to use nukes on the battlefield.)", "After his defeat, Wallace joked, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll sit under the Confederate statue\u201d in his home town of Clayton \u201cand play checkers.\u201d His aides knew that he would run again. He was eventually re\u00eblected governor of Alabama, but in later Presidential bids, in 1972 and 1976, he had much less success. A deranged gunman shot and partially paralyzed Wallace during the 1972 campaign, and he spent the last years of his life in physical pain and in search of spiritual redemption. In 1979, Wallace met with John Lewis, who, fourteen years earlier\u2014when Wallace was governor and Lewis was the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee\u2014had had his skull cracked by Alabama troopers as they broke up a civil-rights march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in Selma. \u201cI\u2019ve come to ask for your forgiveness,\u201d Wallace told Lewis. The latter listened compassionately but asked, \u201cWhy did you order the troopers to stop us, to beat us, on Bloody Sunday, in 1965?\u201d", "By the time of Wallace\u2019s death, in 1998, his influence over the electorate and the two major parties had dissipated to the vanishing point. Yet, as Dan T. Carter, Wallace\u2019s authoritative biographer, writes, this was partly because, as Nixon and successive Republicans co-opted and mainstreamed aspects of Wallace\u2019s strategy, \u201cThe politics of rage that George Wallace made his own had moved from the fringes of our society to center stage.\u201d Carter concluded that Wallace \u201cwas the most influential loser in twentieth-century American politics.\u201d", "Wallace was who he seemed to be\u2014a self-made, ambitious bitter-ender with a knack for the campaign trail and a capacity for personal reflection, at least toward the end. Trump, a Wharton graduate who also rails against the Ivy League, has transcended Wallace\u2019s political achievements by delivering transparently cynical performances that nevertheless, with his gift for stagecraft, come across to many as authentic. In Wallace\u2019s time, it was common to dismiss his candidacy for the Presidency as a last gasp from the dying Jim Crow South. We can now see it as a warning flare\u2014and as a reminder that it was not only Donald Trump who conceived of Trumpism.", "Over the next four years, the post-Trump Republican Party will seek to consolidate the President\u2019s voters in its electoral campaigns, even if his influence is diminished. Some will try it Trump\u2019s way. In a brilliant survey of Republican officeholders and thinkers contemplating the G.O.P. after Trump, my colleague Nick Lemann cites the example of Trump adapters such as Josh Hawley, the ambitious young senator from Missouri\u2014a banker\u2019s son with degrees from Stanford and Yale\u2014who warns against \u201ca powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities.\u201d The internationalist, business-driven Bush-Romney wing of the Party faces a reckoning for which it may not be prepared, even if Trump\u2019s personal post-Presidency turns out to be an inconsequential theatre of rallies, tweets, and far-right talk-show appearances, staged in between legal and financial battles.", "The most worrying part of Trump\u2019s legacy is his no-longer-ambiguous disdain for elections and the Constitution. Out of an instinct for self-preservation, an attraction to authoritarianism, and a wounded ego, Trump has launched an absurdly inept but still frightening attempt to overturn the 2020 results by sheer force of will. He is bequeathing the country a toxic legacy that now goes far beyond the contours of Wallace-ism\u2014a mashup of conspiratorial rhetoric about Dominion voting-machine plots and urban corruption that will echo on talk radio and social-media platforms for years, and provide many rationalizations for antidemocratic action, including violence.", "Anne Applebaum, in her recent book, \u201cTwilight of Democracy,\u201d traces the drift of sections of Poland\u2019s post-Cold War center-right, which was, until quite recently, internationalist and ardently pro-European, but whose \u201csupporters and promoters\u201d have lately come \u201cto embrace a different set of ideas, not just xenophobic and paranoid but openly authoritarian.\u201d The Polish narrative is a reminder that Trump\u2019s election in 2016, although it was shocking at the time to America\u2019s coastal \u00e9lites, trailed the rise of similar politics in Europe\u2014which have only advanced since then. The theme, Applebaum writes with depressing clarity, is that \u201cgiven the right conditions, any society can turn against democracy. Indeed, if history is anything to go by, all of our societies eventually will.\u201d", "Read More About the Presidential Transition"], "authors": ["Steve Coll", "Steve Col", "Susan B.
