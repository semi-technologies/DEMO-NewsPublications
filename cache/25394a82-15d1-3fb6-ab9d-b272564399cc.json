To get that job, Booker challenged an entrenched establishment. \u201cMy political training comes from the roughest of rough campaigns,\u201d he tells David Remnick. \u201cYou just won\u2019t think it\u2019s America, the kind of stuff we had to go up against. And it [was] such a great way to learn [that campaigning] has to be retail\u2014grassroots. And so much of this, in those early primary states, is about that.\u201d", "Booker spoke with Remnick about growing up black in a largely white area of New Jersey, where his parents had to fight to be able to buy a home; about his long relationship with the Kushner family, which started back when Jared Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, was a leading Democratic donor; and why he\u2019s proud to collaborate with even his direst political opponents on issues such as criminal-justice reform. \u201cDonald Trump signed my bill,\u201d Booker states. \u201cI worked with him and his White House to pass a bill that liberated thousands of black people from prison\u201d by retroactively reducing unjustly high sentences related to crack cocaine. \u201cTell that liberated person that Cory Booker should not deal with somebody that he fundamentally disagrees with.\u201d", "Note: In this interview, Senator Booker asserts, \u201cWe now have more African-Americans in this country under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.\u201d The historical accuracy of this comparison has been challenged. More accurately, the number of African-American men under criminal supervision today has been compared to the number of African-American men enslaved in 1850."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/cory-booker-on-how-to-defeat-donald-trump", "keywords": ["donald", "cory", "senator", "number", "supervision", "trump", "remnick", "states", "men", "defeat", "political", "liberated", "white", "booker"], "summary": "Senator Cory Booker burst onto the national scene about a decade ago, after serving as the mayor of the notoriously impoverished and dangerous city of Newark, New Jersey.\nTo get that job, Booker challenged an entrenched establishment.\n\u201cMy political training comes from the roughest of rough campaigns,\u201d he tells David Remnick.\n\u201cDonald Trump signed my bill,\u201d Booker states.\nMore accurately, the number of African-American men under criminal supervision today has been compared to the number of African-American men enslaved in 1850.", "authors": ["Dorothy Wickenden", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Adam Entous", "Richard Brody", "Jeffrey Toobin"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "id": "25394a82-15d1-3fb6-ab9d-b272564399cc"}
