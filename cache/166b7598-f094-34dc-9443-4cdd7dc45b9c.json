But at the beginning of March, right before the lockdown started in France, they knew they were going to have to pivot on their plans. Instead, they planned a civil ceremony for immediate family in June with the intention of celebrating in a bigger way next July.", "The two met by chance at a friend\u2019s restaurant in Paris. \u201cWhen we saw each other for the first time, it was love at first sight, even if we didn\u2019t believe in it before,\u201d Alexandra says. \u201cAfter five minutes, he asked me if I was married with children. [I was] surprised by these questions, to which I answered, \u2018No!\u2019 He replied confidently, \u2018We can work on it!\u2019 Three years later, we\u2019re working on it!\u201d", "The couple planned their entire civil ceremony with help from Colleen Kennedy Cohen, who advised them remotely from London.

Not to mention there\u2019s also the Coco Chanel suite, where Madame Chanel herself lived for 34 years. It was a perfect match!\u201d", "For this portion of the celebration, Alexandra fell in love with a dress from Chanel\u2019s Metiers d\u2019Art collection. \u201cIt was a last-minute choice and perfectly embodied the 1930s era that I love,\u201d she says. \u201cElegant, with the collar tied at the back, cascading as if it were a train, \u00e0 la Grace Kelly. Olivia Douchez, a friend and one of the first ladies of the Chanel Haute Couture, and my mother helped me dress.\u201d The look was completed with Repossi\u2019s Antifer bracelet, diamond leaf and pearl earrings, and a ring lent to the bride by the house of Chanel.", "\u201c\u2018At Last,\u2019 the song we did our first dance to, perfectly describes how we felt [that night],\u201d Alexandra says. \u201c\u2018At last, my love has come along\u2026and life is like a song\u2026\u2019 We felt so blessed to be with those we love and to finally be able to celebrate our union. It was as if we were hovering above the clouds. We\u2019d been ready to get married since our engagement, so we were present and remember every minute.
