The message in question showed the President\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., calling upon \u201can army\u201d of Trump supporters to show up at polls across the country, to \u201cprotect\u201d the election. The Black community, Robinson would later say, saw the post as a \u201cthreat to our ability to express our will for a better future.\u201d But the company, which has become a de-facto arbiter of political speech, interpreted the takedown request as a matter of semantics; Robinson said that it quibbled over the meaning of \u201carmy.\u201d", "Robinson recounted the experience at the launch, over Zoom, of the Real Facebook Oversight Board, an international, ad-hoc cadre of activists and academics convened by the British investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Cadwalladr was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize last year, for exposing the malpractices of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, both in the U.S. and abroad. That reporting led her to the realization that \u201cjournalism alone is not enough.\u201d Earlier this year, she started a nonprofit called All the Citizens, which is organizing the Real Facebook Oversight Board. \u201cThis is an emergency intervention, focussed on the American election,\u201d she told me, a few hours before the launch. Other members include Maria Ressa, a Filipino journalist and leading critic of Facebook\u2019s role in supporting President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s murderous regime; Derrick Johnson, the president of the N.A.A.C.P.; Shireen Mitchell, the founder of Stop Online Violence Against Women; and Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor.", "\u201cOur group has come together for one purpose,\u201d Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard Business School professor emerita and the author of \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d said on the Zoom call. \u201cWe demand comprehensive action to insure that Facebook cannot be weaponized to undermine the vote.\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the director of the Anti-Defamation League, which has been tracking hate groups for decades, observed that Facebook \u201cactively and knowingly has facilitated the flow of poison into the population, and enabled waves of anti-Semitism and racism, Holocaust denialism and Islamophobic conspiracies, disinformation and extremism.\u201d The Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe called his participation in the Real Facebook Oversight Board \u201cprobably the most important effort in my fifty-year career in the law.\u201d", "The Real Facebook Oversight Board is a self-appointed proxy for the official Facebook Oversight Board, which was designed to function as a kind of independent appeals court, adjudicating various challenges to the company\u2019s decisions on whether to remove content. As Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a blog post announcing the official board two years ago, \u201cThe purpose of this body would be to uphold the principle of giving people a voice while also recognizing the reality of keeping people safe.\u201d It was a widely lauded and unprecedented move\u2014what publicly traded company had ever ceded a degree of control to an independent body? But it was also a necessary one. Most companies are regulated by statutes and laws, whereas Facebook, with its unparalleled reach\u2014McNamee described it to me as having \u201cmore active monthly users than there are notional Christians in the world, and twice as many as there are people living in China\u201d\u2014operates in a regulation-free zone. The Facebook Oversight Board\u2019s first twenty members, who were named in May, include Cadwalladr\u2019s former boss at the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger. The body has yet to convene a meeting.", "Cadwalladr\u2019s board has embraced a broader definition of oversight than the one championed by Zuckerberg. From now until the election, its members will use their various platforms to expose the many ways in which Facebook\u2019s algorithms promote divisive, inflammatory, and extreme content; amplify disinformation and misinformation; and promote deceitful political advertising. These methods were crucial to Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, and have not abated in the years since. They\u2019ve contributed to a proliferation of QAnon, white-supremacist militias, anti-vaccine propaganda, and coronavirus falsehoods. They have allowed doctored videos of political figures to circulate. Now, as Trump continues to question, without evidence, the legitimacy of the upcoming election, there is a real danger that his campaign and its followers will use Facebook to sow chaos after the polls close, by challenging the results, posting false information, or inciting Trump\u2019s base to violence. \u201cThe most valuable thing this board can do is to inoculate voters, by giving them the facts,\u201d McNamee told me. \u201cFacebook\u2019s model is that everything is content and it\u2019s all equally valid. They call that free speech. But there is no definition of free speech that has any intellectual value that suggests the systemic destruction of truth, of fact, and of democracy is something that was guaranteed by the First Amendment.\u201d", "Two days before the Real Facebook Oversight Board went public, Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News broadcast a segment showing how the Trump campaign had used racial groupings to suppress the vote in battleground states during the 2016 election. According to a leaked cache of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s voter files, which were seeded with data illegally obtained from millions of unwitting Facebook users, individual voters were not only identified by geography, voting history, behavioral proclivities, and personality traits\u2014they were also segmented by race. And next to a disproportionate number of the names of African-Americans was the word \u201cdeterrence.\u201d According to Channel 4, this was code for the campaign\u2019s voter-suppression efforts, much of it delivered through Facebook ads. This dovetailed with efforts by Russian trolls, as documented in the Mueller report, to dissuade Black Americans from voting at the top of the ticket. \u201cWe tracked the ninety thousand Black people in Michigan alone who cast a down-ticket ballot but left the top of the ticket blank,\u201d Mitchell, whose organization runs the Stop Digital Voter Suppression project, said. Trump won Michigan by less than eleven thousand votes. \u201cIt was the weaponization of Black identity to suppress the vote.\u201d", "In 2018, Facebook established a searchable \u201cad library.\u201d Anyone can now see who is paying for which ads, and the platform allows individual users to find out if a campaign has assigned them to a particular advertising cohort. But the ad library doesn\u2019t reveal if a particular ad is targeting a particular group, so there is still no way to know if a campaign or a political-action committee is using race in an effort to depress the vote. \u201cFacebook allows the advertiser to compose the list by its own criteria,\u201d David Carroll, a professor of media design at the Parsons School of Design and a member of the Real Facebook Oversight Board, told me. \u201cOnce it goes to Facebook, it\u2019s just a list of Facebook user I.D.s.\u201d (Carroll, who spent four years embroiled in a lawsuit to obtain his Cambridge Analytica voter file, was finally able to see it in the leaked cache shared by Channel 4. It contained information about him gathered by the Republican National Committee\u2019s Data Trust. Commercial data brokers, such as Experian and Aristotle, listed the ages of his children, linked to his wife\u2019s profile, and scored his tendency to neuroticism, extroversion, and other personality traits. The file did not explicitly identify Carroll by race or ethnicity, however, and it didn\u2019t indicate his preferred candidate. Carroll ventured that this might be because his Brooklyn Zip Code signalled a likely Clinton supporter, on whom the campaign should not waste its advertising dollars.)", "McNamee, who first met Zuckerberg nearly fourteen years ago, is hopeful that it\u2019s not too late for his old friend to become \u201cthe hero of his own story and do the bare minimum\u201d to preserve democracy. \u201cWhen November 3rd comes, and you\u2019ve continued to do what you\u2019re doing now, you will have had a key role in destroying the American experiment,\u201d McNamee said, of Zuckerberg. \u201cSo we are saying, \u2018Hey, on behalf of everybody pleading with you, do the right thing.\u2019 \u201d The Real Facebook Oversight Board\u2019s inaugural demands are fairly modest: first, Facebook must remove posts that incite violence, even those from public figures, including the President; second, Facebook must ban all advertising that mentions Presidential-election results until one person is definitively declared the winner, and his opponent concedes; and, third, Facebook must label as untrue any post that declares a winner, until the victory is certified and the losing candidate has conceded. A few hours after the group enumerated these demands, it scored its first win: Facebook announced that it would not allow any ads that delegitimized the election\u2019s outcome.", "The members of the Real Facebook Oversight Board know, as well as anyone, that Facebook, in the interest of appearing to be a good global citizen, will sometimes respond to public pressure. That is why the platform created its ad library; added more content moderators; agreed to label some controversial posts with warnings about their veracity; finally banned QAnon; and deployed its own oversight board. But the company seems to be resisting the efforts of Cadwalladr\u2019s watchdog group. Last Monday, the Real Facebook Oversight Board\u2019s Internet-service providers took down the group\u2019s Web sites, because of alleged trademark infringement and phishing. Cadwalladr showed me e-mails which suggested that Facebook lodged the complaint. (A spokesperson for Facebook said that the Web sites had been automatically flagged by a vender.) \u201cIt fits a pattern of behavior, where Facebook is prepared to use blunt force against its critics and no longer cares how that appears,\u201d Cadwalladr told me. \u201cAnd it exposes its words as a sham. I literally have an e-mail from a week ago, from the head of communications at the Oversight Board\u2014Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s former speechwriter\u2014saying, \u2018We very much welcome your new effort\u2019 and \u2018if you can shine a greater spotlight on these issues, that is a good thing.\u2019 \u201d", "Read More About the 2020 Election"], "authors": ["Sue Halpern", "Sue Halper"], "keywords": ["president", "election", "adhoc", "activists", "board", "told", "group", "convene", "campaign", "oversight", "trump", "academics", "real", "facebook", "zuckerberg"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
