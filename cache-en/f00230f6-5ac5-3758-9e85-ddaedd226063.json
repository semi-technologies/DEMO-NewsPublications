The relief package is reported to have a price tag of around 900 billion and is said to include a second round of direct payments to Americans. The agreement would leave out state and local funding and a liability shield for businesses.", "Wyoming Senator John Barrasso (R-Wy) gave an update on the negotiations to Fox News Radio's Guy Benson. Senator Barrasso said,", "\"We're much more optimistic that we're going to get a solution that the people of America are looking for. And that leaves out the areas where we disagree in terms of the money that that Schumer has been asking for, for state and local governments, for things that are completely unrelated to coronavirus, we need to stay focused and targeted right on where the need is.\"", "Barrasso outlined the details of the ongoing negotiations, confirming that lawmakers are looking at a price tag of around 900 billion. Saying,", "\"In terms of the total overall price tag, your numbers are correct. There are a significant amount of that money is going to be though. Money that is already passed with the CARES Act and is now going to be repurposed to be used. So in terms of adding to the debt, it would be a lot less than that because there's already money available that had been through the Department of Treasury.\"", "With negotiations on Capitol Hill ongoing, Barrasso reiterated that lawmakers are committed to passing a relief package before the end of the year. Saying,", "\"The question is when. But clearly before Christmas. And Mitch McConnell has been very clear, we are not heading home for the holidays until after we have this done passed and sent to the president of the United States.\"", "Barrasso also said that there will only be a \"single package\" that deals with coronavirus relief and funding of the government, passed between now and the end of the year. Saying,", "\"There's only going to be one bill between now and the end of the year, and that's going to be a single package that deals with the coronavirus as well as the funding of government for the next year through the appropriations process. Everything else is going to be moved on to to next year.\"", "Listen To The Full Interview Below:"], "authors": ["Wyatt Dobrovichfago"], "keywords": ["barrasso", "john", "package", "coronavirus", "terms", "details", "price", "negotiations", "covid", "final", "tag", "rwy", "going", "money", "relief", "passed", "sen", "reveals"], "pubDate": "2020-12-16T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
