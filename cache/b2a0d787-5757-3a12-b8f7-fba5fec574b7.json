Early in the morning of October 29th a general in Ethiopia\u2019s federal army had flown to the northern region of Tigray to take up his new position as deputy commander of forces in the region. He was refused entry. In Mekelle, the regional capital, rumours swirled of troop movements across the state border in the Amhara region, as well as in Eritrea, a country to its north. Throughout Tigray young men had been armed and trained. On November 2nd its president said the region was preparing for war.", "War may have begun. On November 4th Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered his forces to hit back in response to what he claimed was an \u201cattack\u201d by Tigray\u2019s ruling party on a base housing federal troops. \u201cThe red line has been crossed,\u201d he said. Early reports suggest there had been a heavy exchange of artillery fire around Mekelle and on the border with Amhara. The internet and phone networks in Tigray were cut off. Abiy has declared a state of emergency in the region. In a television address he said the fighting had resulted in casualties, though he did not say how many. As The Economist went to press it was unclear whether the conflict would be limited to a brief skirmish or might blow up into a full-scale war.", "The latest escalation comes after months of bitter feuding between Abiy and leaders of the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), an armed group that turned into a political party after leading the rebellion that ousted the Derg, a Marxist junta, in 1991. Since then, for almost three decades, the TPLF called the shots in the federal government before massive protests in 2018 among the Oromos, who make up roughly a third of Ethiopia\u2019s population, forced it to make way for Abiy.", "His administration views the TPLF as spoilers who are sabotaging Ethiopia\u2019s fragile transition to democracy. The TPLF, by contrast, sees Abiy as a usurper determined to tear up the constitution, which guarantees self-rule for each of Ethiopia\u2019s nine ethnically based states\u2014and even the right to secede. When the central government postponed elections earlier this year, citing covid-19, the TPLF accused Abiy of scheming to extend his time in office.", "The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the federal government and went ahead to hold its own regional election. Instead of quietly accepting the result, the central government said it was illegal. The federal parliament voted to isolate Tigray\u2019s leaders. The finance ministry in Addis Ababa stopped giving money to the regional government and set in motion plans to send funds directly to local authorities. It is also said to have blocked welfare payments to poor farmers and to have tried to prevent investors and even some tourists from travelling to Mekelle.", "The TPLF said that slashing federal funding amounted to a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d. It called for Abiy to step down and for a caretaker government to replace him. Although the prime minister had repeatedly ruled out armed intervention, parliament recently authorised it. Both sides had flexed their muscles with military shows of force. \u201cIf Abiy wishes to fight this out, we will pay him in his coin,\u201d Getachew Reda, a senior TPLF official, told The Economist in late October.", "It is not the only conflict tugging hard at the seams of the Ethiopian state. Abiy is also waging a war against armed separatists in his own region of Oromia, the country\u2019s largest. He is struggling to quell popular protests against his rule there and elsewhere. In the past few weeks there have been several massacres, mostly of Amharas. On November 1st armed men killed dozens of women and children in a school yard in western Oromia, according to Amnesty International.", "The federal government claims that the TPLF fuels these various conflicts by arming and training opposition groups, though hard evidence has yet to be shown. This, it says, justifies action. On November 2nd Abiy\u2019s allies in Amhara called on him to finish off the TPLF \u201conce and for all\u201d. Parliament suggested it would declare the TPLF a \u201cterrorist\u201d organisation.", "Abiy may be hoping to reassert control over Tigray with a quick strike. But three factors make the conflict with the TPLF especially dangerous. First, the TPLF is by far the best equipped and most powerful of Ethiopia\u2019s opposition forces. Though Tigrayans are less than 10% of Ethiopia\u2019s population, the region\u2019s paramilitaries are led by veterans of both the long struggle against the Derg and of a devastating war with Eritrea fought mostly between 1998 and 2000. Tigrayan officers purged by Abiy from the federal army are said to have returned to Tigray to train and organise new recruits. Though the constitution allows each region to have its own security forces, the prime minister\u2019s office has accused the TPLF of unconstitutionally \u201carming and organising irregular militias\u201d.", "Moreover, Tigray is also the home-base for the Ethiopian army\u2019s most powerful units, amounting to more than half its soldiers. Organised into its Northern Command, they bore the brunt of the fighting against Eritrea. The TPLF reckons that many of the Northern Command\u2019s officers and soldiers would switch sides or mutiny if Abiy ordered them into battle against Tigray. On November 4th Tigray\u2019s state broadcaster claimed that many officers and other ranks had already defected. The federal government denies it.", "The third factor is Eritrea. In 2018 Abiy ended the cold war between the countries by signing a peace deal with Eritrea\u2019s ageing dictator, Isaias Afeworki, for which Abiy was awarded the Nobel prize the year after. But Isaias, whose enmity with the TPLF stretches back decades, has shown little appetite for peace. Instead, he has stepped up his efforts to topple his old foes by cosying up to Abiy. On October 31st Eritrea\u2019s government declared that the TPLF was \u201con its deathbed\u201d. Eritrean troops are said to have been conducting provocative manoeuvres along the border. \u201cTigray is preparing for war on two fronts,\u201d says Fetsum Berhane, a Tigrayan activist.", "Both sides claim to have done all they can to prevent escalation. \u201cWhat we want is to avoid bloodshed,\u201d said Seyoum Mesfin, a Tigrayan who was a former foreign minister of Ethiopia, recently in Mekelle. He stressed that the TPLF wanted dialogue, but with all parties on an equal footing. Abiy\u2019s office, for its part, claims the government has \u201cretained a policy of extreme patience\u201d but that war cannot be prevented by the \u201cgoodwill\u201d of only one side. It insisted the army was acting to \u201csave the country and the region from spiralling into instability\u201d. As both sides edge closer to war, some hear echoes of 1998. That was when Ethiopia and Eritrea sleepwalked into a catastrophic conflict. There is still just enough time for both sides to wake up."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["arms", "ethiopia", "tplf", "tigray", "region", "lurches", "eritrea", "ethiopias", "civil", "federal", "sides", "war", "abiys", "abiy", "armed"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
