As have folk singers and story tellers. Now science is taking a turn, in the hope that research on how dogs grow and age will help us understand how humans age. And, like the poets before them, scientists are finding parallels between the two species.", "Their research so far shows that dogs are similar to us in important ways, like how they act during adolescence and old age, and what happens in their DNA as they get older.

They seem to mellow in the same way that most humans do. The most intriguing part of this study is that like people, some dogs are just born old, which is to say, relatively steady and mature, the kind of pup that just seems ready for a Mr. Rogers cardigan. \u201cThat\u2019s professor Spot, to you, thank you, and could we be a little neater when we pour kibble into my dish?\u201d"], "authors": ["James Gorman"], "keywords": ["study", "scientists", "ways", "secrets", "whitemuzzled", "humans", "research", "age", "old", "way", "aging", "dogs"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
