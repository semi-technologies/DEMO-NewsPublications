The physical release of Ori and the Will of the Wisps hit retail shelves today, and can also be purchased from Nintendo's eShop or as a collector's edition from iam8bit.", "Developer Moon Studios, iam8bit, and distributor Skybound Games are also pledging $25,000 to Rainforest Trust. In a press release, iam8bit's Jon M. Gibson and Amanda White said \"As we\u2019ve worked with Moon Studios to publish the Ori series on Nintendo Switch, we\u2019ve been struck by their dedication to expressing nature as a living, breathing entity worthy of protection. Following their lead, we wanted to do our part to preserve nature, and are excited to work with the wonderful and dedicated people at Rainforest Trust to do just that.\u201d", "If you don't want to purchase the game (which you may already have downloaded on Xbox Game Pass), but want to donate, you can do that at Rainforest Trust's website. That said, I can't say enough great things about Ori and the Will of the Wisps. It's making my personal top 10 list this year. If you love platformers with exploratory freedom and brain-bending puzzles, the Ori series is worth a look.", "Both Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps are remarkable (and challenging) games. I gave both games review scores of 9.5 out of 10. In my Will of the Wisps review I said \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with Will of the Wisps, delivering an experience that doesn\u2019t have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\""], "authors": ["Weekly Trips To Arcades To Owning Every System That Hit The Market Since The Atari", "Andrew Has Dedicated His Life To Video Games."], "keywords": ["saving", "games", "world", "weve", "rainforest", "game", "percentage", "studios", "moon", "wisps", "ori", "sales", "trust"], "pubDate": "2020-12-08T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
