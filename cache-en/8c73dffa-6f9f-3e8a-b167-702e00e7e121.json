That night hundreds of gunmen riding on motorbikes stormed a boarding school in Kankara, also in Katsina state. Some schoolboys jumped over a fence and ran away when they heard gunshots. But more than 300 were rounded up and herded into the surrounding forest. One who later escaped told the BBC they were beaten, threatened and forced to walk through the night.", "It was not immediately clear who the culprits were. Nigeria\u2019s government says that the children were taken by bandits who have demanded a ransom for their release. But Boko Haram, a jihadist group, said it was behind the kidnapping. Both explanations are plausible.", "Criminal gangs in Nigeria have long been experts at \u201cexpress kidnaps\u201d, in which wealthy locals and foreigners are grabbed at gunpoint and held until cash is handed over or their bank accounts are emptied through ATM S . In the past few years such gangs have become less discriminating, grabbing thousands of poor folk, including travellers on buses or people living in villages (see map). In some places they have demanded levies from farmers before they allow them to harvest their crops."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["told", "villages", "gangs", "schoolchildren", "state", "nigerias", "boys", "katsina", "walk", "travellers", "kankara", "lost", "nigeria", "wealthy", "abducted", "demanded", "300"], "pubDate": "2020-12-19T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
