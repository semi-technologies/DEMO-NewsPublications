What is this?\u2019\u201d says the director of Winford Bilingual Primary School, which the 45-year-old American helped set up in 2012 on a quiet inlet off Beethovenstraat. The Dutch children, who comprise almost half the student body, were ready with a reply: \u201cbecause when you go to the park and you get lost, they can just call my mom and dad.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cThat would never happen in America!\u201d Otto continues. \u201cThat\u2019s so great that children and parents have that freedom here, where they can just be children and not worry about being kidnapped or stranger-danger or gun violence.\u201d", "When she was recruited to help design the program, the school had not formally been established. It was just budding from the Little Universe School, a bilingual daycare business, which last year declared bankruptcy and closed, but that, back when Otto was visiting, had a unique appeal.", "\u201cIt was so cute to go into the daycare setting and see a little three-year-old in a Dutch accent say: \u2018Would you like water?\u2019\u201d she warmly recollects. Then at lunchtime \u201cthese little English kids would be like: \u2018Eet smakelijk allemaal!\u2019 And there isn\u2019t really an English translation for it.\u201d", "Charmed, Otto accepted the offer to be the school\u2019s first Anglophone teacher. It helped, too, that she had a sense of the place she would be moving for work.", "Dutch culture and tolerance", "\u201cAmsterdam was my first big city that I lived in, and I loved it,\u201d she shares, referring to her first round of Dutch residency, to attend the University of Amsterdam for a writing program. Two years later, when she left the Dutch capital for the US capital, it was for her \u201cdream job\u201d as a lead educator at the Smithsonian Institute. Eventually, though, she realized how \u201cI missed the Dutch culture and the tolerance,\u201d she recalls. Before long, she was back.", "At Winford Bilingual each class has one native Dutch-speaking teacher and one native English-speaking teacher. The classrooms themselves are divided into halves, with each side designated for learning in each language.", "\u201cHere everything in red is in Dutch,\u201d Otto explains, pointing towards placards the shade of a ripe tomato on which vowel sounds, such as aa and ij, are mounted. \u201cWhen the students get ready to do their reading group 3 lesson, if they\u2019re over here they know: \u2018Oh that\u2019s going to be with the Dutch teacher, Willem, so we\u2019re going to get out my Dutch books.\u2019 Their mind can make that switch, but they\u2019re also physically making that switch.\u201d", "Directing attention to the classroom\u2019s other half, liberally accented in blue, she continues: \u201cThen when it\u2019s time to go to the English lesson, they get up and walk over.\u201d", "Otto\u2019s sensitization to bilingualism began early on. She was born in Thailand, to a Thai mother and an American father in the military.", "\u201cWhen my father left the Air Force, we moved back to a really tiny town in South Carolina. So the first three years of my life I only spoke Thai and some English, but when I moved back to the US, they only wanted me to speak English,\u201d she says. \u201cSwitching languages was fun, and I saw it as an adventure.\u201d", "16,900 euros", "As a private school that wants control over its curriculum, Winford Bilingual receives no government subsidies, and annual tuition costs 16,900 euros. In March, it was acquired by Dutch school group Winford and given its current name (it was previously also called Little Universe School), and in September it reopens in a new location, near Museumplein.", "\u201cOur school is really aimed to be a reflection of the Amsterdam community: multilingual, bilingual and very diverse,\u201d Otto emphasizes.", "This past year, of the 39 students, about 40% were Dutch and 42% had a parent who is English-speaking or has lived in somewhere in the EU but \u201cchosen Amsterdam as their home base,\u201d she says. Those \u201cwho are not Dutch natives consider themselves international.\u201d", "Regular \u201cexcursies,\u201d Otto notes, provide \u201ca good way for Dutch and international children to get to know the city on a personal basis because that is our goal\u2014to get children integrated into Dutch society, but more so to understand how Amsterdam works.\u201d Recent trips involved a visit to a refugee shelter, a tour of stained-glass windows, and a ferry to Noord.", "\u201cSome of our children had never ridden the ferry, and it was super exciting,\u201d she says. \u201cFunnily enough, some of our Dutch children had never taken the tram because they always bike.\u201d", "Flexible vacation days", "Inasmuch as Winford Bilingual promotes appreciation for the city in which it is located, the school also well accommodates the need to leave town, notably for families who must travel far to reach their origin countries and Dutch families, whom Otto describes as more jet-setting than their non-Dutch counterparts. Besides a two-week Christmas holiday and four weeks off in the summer, there are 40 flexible vacation days, which cannot all be taken at once because the Netherlands is \u201creally quite strict on attendance,\u201d says Otto.", "\u201cMaybe a week or two after May vacation\u2014they call it \u2018Meivakantie\u2019 here\u2014I\u2019ll have parents that go a week or two before, and I\u2019ll get a little letter from the leerplicht, saying: \u2018Is this child registered at your school?\u2019 Because they check passports here,\u201d she says, referring to a truancy officer. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s very different. We don\u2019t have that in America.\u201d", "As for her own to-and-froing, \u201cwe\u2019ve made that commitment,\u201d Otto laughs. She refers to having bought a home in Zandvoort with her husband, an American from Minnesota with whom she compares job perks\u2014\u201cI joke that he only gets 30 vacation days and I get 50 (but in the US he would have 10).\u201d A charm of the small coastal town is that \u201call my neighbors know me,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cWhen a package comes they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh your package\u2019s over at Brahim and Marjiam\u2019s house.\u2019\u201d", "But best of all, \u201cI can my practice my Dutch much more,\u201d she says in her friendly southern drawl, distinct in both English and Dutch."], "authors": ["Karina Hof", "Floris Vermeulen"], "keywords": ["really", "netherlands", "amsterdam", "otto", "strict", "english", "dutch", "quite", "school", "bilingual", "children", "teacher", "little", "winford", "attendance"], "pubDate": "2019-08-02T09:00:00Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
