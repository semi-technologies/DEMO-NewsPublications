That\u2019s when Olson, then 44, his body pumping with adrenaline and his hip throbbing with new pain from a metastasized tumor, uttered these words: \u201cI want to get my cancer sequenced.\u201d", "Wearing a slickly designed black T-shirt with the words \u201cSequence Me\u201d in block heavy-metal-style lettering, Olson preaches to audiences at health care conferences that they should take back control of their health from paternalistic providers and demand better cancer care. On his website, he offers patients a \u201cbattle card\u201d with scripted comebacks to doctors\u2019 resistance.", "And if your doctor refuses to order genetic testing? \u201cWell, then you need a new doctor!\u201d he exclaims to often enthusiastic applause.", "But in 2014, his own doctor at the Oregon Health & Science University medical center in Portland, after hearing Olson\u2019s request, had merely asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense, the doctor had said, especially if it turned out there were no drugs available for the DNA mutations the sequencing technology would find.", "Despite the handful of so-called targeted cancer therapies that were matched to patients\u2019 genetic makeup, there wasn\u2019t one for prostate cancer that had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.", "Olson was already aware of that fact. The conversation was life-changing, because it marked the moment he was done with the American medical system\u2014or at least what\u2019s known as \u201cstandard of care\u201d for cancer patients.", "By that time, Olson had already undergone surgery to remove his prostate gland and seminal vesicles. Soon after, he learned the cancer had spread to his bones\u2014creating lesions the size of quarters\u2014and was incurable. That was the news that made him sob hysterically inside his car in the hospital parking garage while blaring the radio and repeatedly screaming \u201cFuck!\u201d He\u2019d researched the statistic that the median five-year survival rate for Stage 4 prostate cancer patients was 28 percent.", "Olson also had just finished six months of chemotherapy. Despite hearing about a \u201cgolden age\u201d of cancer treatment, he was prescribed the drug docetaxel, which had been patented in 1986 and was routinely given to patients with breast, lung, prostate, stomach, and head and neck cancers. The treatment, sold under the brand name Taxotere, was so toxic it had earned the name \u201cTaxo-Terrible,\u201d because of its dreaded side effects. Olson got them all: zero energy, hair loss, bone pain, mouth sores, constipation, and a numb sensation in his feet that felt like needles were poking him and made it hard to keep his balance.", "The mother of his 6-year-old daughter\u2019s best friend had been so worried about him she asked the school district to move up the annual father-daughter dance from spring to fall to make sure he could attend. During those months, he\u2019d tried to spend as much time with his kid as possible.", "At home, he\u2019d play guitar while she drew, or he streamed his favorite \u201980s movies, such as Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. Even though she was too young to understand the references, he wanted to make sure she didn\u2019t miss out on what he considered an important part of his childhood. He also gave her pep talks about avoiding drugs and only dating boys who treated her right\u2014in case he didn\u2019t get another chance later.", "Olson was grateful she didn\u2019t grasp how sick he really was, so he wrote and recorded songs for her to listen to when she was older. His favorite lyric from his song \u201cMy Girl\u201d: You won\u2019t see me on the outside. But I\u2019ll be there on the inside.", "Sign Up Today Sign up for our Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.", "Some days he was angry at the world, and other days he was overwhelmed with sadness as he sat on the couch in front of the window and watched people walking by, knowing they were planning their weekends and summer vacations. He wondered about mundane details: Should he buy new winter clothes if he would only end up wearing them for a season? Brushing his teeth felt like a ridiculous waste of time."], "authors": ["Sarah Elizabeth Richards", "Sarah Elizabeth Richard"], "keywords": ["data", "dna", "olson", "didnt", "care", "doctor", "health", "patients", "words", "prostate", "save", "hed", "search", "cancer", "mans", "life"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
