The nature of television\u2014produced months in advance, enjoyed from the safety of one\u2019s couch, and, thanks to streaming services, infinitely bingeable\u2014separated it from the other popular art forms whose production had been utterly halted. Here was the last form of entertainment standing. At least there would always be something to watch. (No guarantee that it would always be that good.) Lists and recommendations were compiled to help quarantiners sort through the muck, many with half-joking invocations of escapism: \u201cThese Travel TV Shows Will Help You Escape From Your Couch\u201d; \u201c30 Reality TV Shows That Will Help You Escape Reality.\u201d", "Escape, as it turned out, was impossible. Watching television this year was often a fraught activity, the passiveness of the auto-play highlighting the collapse of time outside the frame. I found myself watching all species of television this year, including what I typically neglect (Taiwanese baseball, for instance), because what else was there to do? I loved and resented it; I relied on it and was exhausted by it. It made me feel alive and sometimes a little bit dead.", "2020 in Review New Yorker writers reflect on the year\u2019s highs and lows.", "Unscripted programs, canonically the wallpaper of the television landscape, kept me rapt. Daytime talk shows were one of the first to adapt to the constraints of the pandemic, replacing the in-person jamboree with a virtual Brady Bunch formation\u2014a remodelling that felt like a neat commentary on the country\u2019s idealization of resilience. I also watched people watch television, which felt sort of quaint. I am thinking of the return of the group watch: documentary series such as \u201cTiger King\u201d and \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d; the political peacocking of the Cuomo brothers; an N.B.A. season with no fans, at Walt Disney World; the interview gauntlet \u201cBaited with Ziwe,\u201d on Instagram Live; and, most recently, the silliness of \u201cThe Undoing.\u201d", "Shows now awkwardly seek to wrangle the pandemic, to produce a culture around the crisis. We\u2019ve gotten hamfisted commentary like \u201cSocial Distance,\u201d on Netflix, and \u201cCoastal Elites,\u201d on HBO, as well as pandemic camp on ABC\u2019s \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cLaw and Order: S.V.U.\u201d But Hollywood is learning that not every event can be narrativized or managed. Some shows have been cancelled, and we\u2019ve been hearing increasingly more often about seasons that have been postponed; it\u2019s likely that, in 2021, we\u2019ll finally start to feel the pickings grow slim. But, for now, here is a list\u2014in no particular order\u2014of the shows that did something both small and miraculous this year: demanded our full attention.", "\u201cThe American Barbecue Showdown\u201d (Netflix)", "For the past few years, reality-TV producers have been tripping over themselves to create an American equivalent of \u201cThe Great British Bake Off\u201d: a competition of arrestingly kind eccentrics who display a devotion toward a stress-inducing hobby that verges on the religious. Only \u201cThe American Barbecue Showdown\u201d has come close. Officially, it is a grilling contest. Spiritually, it is a gloss of Americana, an atonement for colonial sins, and a platform encouraging obsession with figures such as Grubbs, a \u201cbackwood grill-billy\u201d; Shotgun, a mohawked giant; and Boatright, a man who sings love songs to his meats. The show is so charming that you can excuse one dystopian detail: the contestants wear the same clothes throughout its eight episodes.", "\u201cRamy\u201d (Hulu)", "Photograph by Craig Blankenhorn / Hulu", "\u201cRamy\u201d had the best sum of performances of any show I watched this year. The second season pulled back from the exploits of its charming fuckboy protagonist (also its co-creator, Ramy Youssef) and became more of an anthology, with some episodes diverging from the main story line to produce vignettes of secondary characters. Graceful performances by Mahershala Ali, Hiam Abbass, and Amr Waked invigorated \u201cRamy\u201d before it had a chance to become stale. A stunning episode about the closeted life of Uncle Naseem, the churlish owner of a Diamond District jewelry shop, should raise the profile of the underrated actor Laith Nakli.", "\u201cI May Destroy You\u201d (BBC/HBO)", "What else is there to say about Michaela Coel\u2019s masterpiece?", "\u201cHarley Quinn\u201d (Originally DC Universe; now HBO Max)", "This pick is really about Kaley Cuoco. Movie stars have colonized the small screen, overwhelming prestige dramas with their meta-recognizability. I miss the blunt, workman magnetism of the career television star, who lives by the ethic of disappearing, body and soul, into the world of the character. Bless network television for giving us Cuoco. Not even the formulaic rhythm of the weekly sitcom (\u201c8 Simple Rules\u201d; \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d) has dulled the actor\u2019s natural warmth and wildness, which are on roaring display in her voice acting as a post-breakup Harley Quinn, in the namesake animated series, now in its second season. Check out \u201cThe Flight Attendant,\u201d on HBO, which stars Cuoco, too.", "\u201cCity So Real\u201d (Hulu/National Geographic)", "Photograph courtesy Chicago Story Film, LLC", "Everyone has something to say about Chicago. In this five-part documentary series covering the 2019 mayoral election, the documentarian Steve James lets the people of Chicago speak for themselves. Its fifth episode, about Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the city\u2019s residents grappling with the pandemic and civil unrest, is a brilliant coda\u2014one that further brings into focus the documentary\u2019s exploration of a complicated city.", "\u201cTeenage Bounty Hunters\u201d (Netflix)", "Photograph courtesy Netflix", "Its cancellation is an injustice. Kathleen Jordan\u2019s d\u00e9but series, about wealthy twin sisters living double lives as bounty hunters, took so many surprising and rewarding detours in its ten episodes; the wackiness of the show\u2019s rude premise allowed for sweet explorations of race, Southernness, queerness, and the struggle to be good. Maddie Phillips and Anjelica Bette Fellini form a mesmerizing odd couple. As a friend described it over text message: it\u2019s \u201ca messy bitch\u201d of an adventure.", "\u201cNormal People\u201d (BBC/Hulu)", "The achievement of this drama\u2014an adaptation of a Sally Rooney novel\u2014is in its depiction of intimacy. Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones twine around each other so believably that the later episodes are almost painful. It was a fitting romance for the quarantined viewer: Irish horniness laced with dread."], "authors": ["Doreen St. F\u00e9lix", "Doreen St. F\u00e9li"], "keywords": ["episodes", "watch", "hbo", "2020", "television", "pandemic", "tv", "series", "cuoco", "shows", "season", "best", "help"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
