I can tell, from her brown eyes, that she\u2019s smiling beneath her face mask. As we roam rooms painted moody blue for her new exhibition, in which her paintings, bronzes and neons are juxtaposed with the oils and watercolours of Edvard Munch, Emin adjusts her stoma bag occasionally and laughs a lot. \u201cI\u2019m in love with Munch,\u201d she says. \u201cNot with the art, but with the man. I have been since I was 18.\u201d", "This is not what I expected. Minutes earlier, walking through this London gallery\u2019s courtyard, I felt darkness descending everywhere. England was re-entering lockdown, Biden hadn\u2019t yet won Michigan and the last visitors to the Royal Academy for a month were heading out into the night. I expected the 57-year-old artist to be at death\u2019s door, defeated by disease and circumstance. She is, after all, putting on an exhibition hardly anyone will see: \u201cThey sold 16,000 advance tickets but when Boris announced the second lockdown, we knew we couldn\u2019t open.\u201d All she can hope is that the gallery will open in December, but that is uncertain.", "Moreover, 2020 seemed set to be Emin\u2019s last year on Earth. \u201cTo get past Christmas would be good,\u201d ran the headline earlier this month in the Sunday Times. In June, she was sunning herself naked on the roof of her studio when she noticed her catheter was blood-stained (she\u2019s used a catheter since being treated for appendicitis five years ago, when her bladder stopped functioning and she suffered kidney reflux, pushing urine back into her body). In July, she was admitted to hospital where 12 surgeons worked for six hours to remove a large tumour from her bladder. They cut out her uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, lymph nodes, part of her colon, urethra and some of her vagina. She kept her clitoris, but reflects sadly that it doesn\u2019t work.", "\u2018A sense of fear\u2019 \u2026 the artist kept an Instagram diary of her changing moods in lockdown. Photograph: Instagram/White Cube", "She blames years of smoking: \u201cCarbon monoxide travels into the bladder. It\u2019s one of the biggest cancer killers, but hardly anybody knows about it.\u201d She has now quit the elite coterie of committed Brit art smokers that includes Maggi Hambling, who never appears in photographs without fag in hand, and David Hockney, who sent Emin a get well card. \u201cWhen I said I\u2019d given up smoking, he called me a coward. And Maggi\u2019s a hardcore anarchist. I\u2019m not as hardcore as that.\u201d Personally, I doubt that last point.", "When Emin says she\u2019s lucky, she means two things. Firstly, she\u2019s luckier than those who died of Covid. \u201cEven when I thought I had six months to live, I was luckier than them. I wasn\u2019t going to die alone \u2013 and if it was going to be six months, I at least had time to plan my last days.\u201d", "Secondly, for the longest time, she has felt cursed. \u201cI had a friend who said, \u2018Terrible things are always happening to you.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Yeah, they really are. It\u2019s like it\u2019s never-ending.\u2019\u201d She was raped twice as a teenager, suffered a miscarriage, had a botched termination, attempted suicide, and lost two of her most renowned works in a fire: her appliqu\u00e9 tent, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995, and her beach hut self-portrait, The Last Thing I Said to You Is Don\u2019t Leave Me Here.", "I always thought I\u2019d need a partner. I don\u2019t. To be happy, I just need myself, nobody else", "She remembers, at the age of 23, falling out of a boat at night into dark waters. \u201cIt was a nice feeling,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes you drown. It\u2019s just like going to sleep so you don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d Minutes later, she was on the beach having seawater pumped out of her lungs. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that\u2019s quite an experience but not like what happened to me in the summer with the cancer. I did feel cursed most of my life and then after this one, when they took my bladder out, I thought, \u2018Fucking brilliant! This manky old thing that\u2019s caused me problems all my life has gone.\u2019 And the curse that was like thrown on me has gone with it. It\u2019s in the incinerator. I\u2019m free of that now.\u201d She throws open her arms expansively. \u201cI will find love! I will have exhibitions like this one. I will enjoy my life! I will!\u201d", "You look well, I say. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a drink for four months,\u201d she replies, by way of explanation. But there\u2019s more to it than that. \u201cI didn\u2019t have chemotherapy so when people see me, they think I\u2019m completely normal. But I\u2019m still having to recover. I can\u2019t walk that far really. I can\u2019t run. I can\u2019t do a lot of things. It\u2019ll take about six months before I\u2019m better. I am getting better. I have a check-up every two months and a scan because this kind of cancer is so nasty. But yeah, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d", "Juxtaposed \u2026 Edvard Munch\u2019s Crouching Nude, left, and Tracey Emin\u2019s You Kept It Coming. Composite: Munchmuseet/Tracey Emin, courtesy the artist and Xavier Hufkens, Brussels", "Emin is wearing walking boots beneath a tweed jacket and dress: they look like a hopeful investment in a future that, at one point this year, she didn\u2019t expect to experience. Earlier today, prospective buyers visited her long-time home in Spitalfields, just across the street from Gilbert and George\u2019s house. She\u2019s moving into a Georgian property with huge windows across town in Fitzroy Square. So you\u2019re going posh? \u201cI am! I thought I\u2019d never leave the East End. But this house \u2013 the light is amazing. I can imagine painting in my pyjamas and, because it\u2019s pedestrianised, I\u2019ll be able to hear the birdsong.\u201d", "It feels like a new beginning. \u201cI always thought I\u2019d need a partner. I don\u2019t. I just need myself to be happy. I need myself to do this, nobody else.\u201d Men, she admits, including former lovers Billy Childish, Carl Freedman and Mat Collishaw, helped her artistic development. \u201cBilly made me use oil paints but he also pushed me into realising how to be an artist \u2013 in being creative in everything you do and very disciplined.\u201d White Cube gallerist Jay Jopling, discovering Emin was an obsessive letter-writer, encouraged her to do her first text-based works.", "But now? She yearns for love, but also wants solitude to paint. There was a time after she graduated from art school when she couldn\u2019t paint. \u201cI was pregnant and the smell made me sick.\u201d And anyway, there was a feeling that painting was ostensibly obsolete. \u201cI never believed that,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved painting and the love has got deeper as I\u2019ve got older. It\u2019s where I\u2019m happiest.\u201d Fitzroy Square has another advantage. \u201cIt\u2019s in hobbling distance of my urologist in Harley Street.\u201d Her new home is also handy for St Pancras station, from where she can get trains to her studio in her beloved hometown of Margate, and to her place in the south of France.", "Echoes of Munch \u2026 I Am the Last of My Kind, 2019. Photograph: Tracey Emin, DACS 2020/Galleria Lorcan O'Neill", "We sit beneath two paintings, Munch\u2019s 1897 Women in Hospital which is dominated by a naked patient, and Emin\u2019s extraordinary picture from 2019, You Kept It Coming, itself dominated by a female figure crawling over a ground of red and a sky of darkling blue. Her assistant, Harry Weller, watched her as she made this picture. \u201cShe was crying and screaming,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then she would spin around like a whirling dervish.\u201d", "\u201cI do paint like that,\u201d she concedes. \u201cI\u2019m lost in a world of love.\u201d", "Emin spent a lot of time going through the archives at the Munch Museum in Oslo to select works for the show. One day, she pulled out a drawer of watercolours. As a Norwegian curator translated the poem that inspired these works, she found herself crying, her tears very nearly dropping onto the work. \u201cI could have destroyed it! Or made it into the ultimate collaboration.\u201d", "Why does she love Munch? \u201cBecause he loved women. I used to think he was gay, because his pictures of men are quite sexy and because he lived alone. But the truth is he just treated women well. His housemaids said he was always proper with his models. He didn\u2019t fuck them, unlike lots of artists. Also, he painted great breasts \u2013 but vaginas? Hopeless.\u201d Munch often concealed his nude women\u2019s genitals, though whether out of prudishness or because he couldn\u2019t paint them well is uncertain. His painting Puberty is typical: a naked girl, knees together, conceals herself with her arms. Throughout this show, Munch\u2019s nudes are coyly draped below the waist. Emin notes that when Munch does attempt to paint a vagina, he is unconvincing. \u201cThey\u2019re in the wrong place!\u201d", "Emin has no such problems. From room to room, blood flows across her canvases, often from between the legs of nudes. \u201cMy cunt is wet with fear,\u201d says one neon. In I Am the Last of My Kind, a pink nude is wrapped in text. \u201cI am getting old now,\u201d part of it reads, \u201cbut not as old as my broken fucked up vagina that\u2019s so connected to my soul.\u201d", "\u2018I want to live and love and scream\u2019 \u2026 another extract from Emin\u2019s diary. Photograph: Instagram/White Cube", "When Emin studied at the Royal College of Art in the 1980s, she was out of temper with the times. Her unfashionable love for Munch and conviction that art should be about expressing often intolerable emotions was symptomatic of a greater disconnection: art was too cold, too intellectual, too rapacious in its gaze for her sensibility. \u201cPicasso was about \u2018art\u2019,\u201d she says in a catalogue interview. \u201cMunch wasn\u2019t.\u201d The Norwegian was, rather, about expression. Some of her peers \u2013 she cites Peter Doig \u2013 dug Munch, but not quite in the way the young Emin did. In 1998, she made a film about Munch, letting out a great long howl at the end while standing on the pier near Oslo where he painted The Scream.", "Munch has long been her soulmate, there to take her outside the postmodern art business of filling the world with beguiling commodities to titillate otherwise bored collectors. \u201cOur job as artists is not to make something beautiful,\u201d she says and refuses vehemently the idea that she was ever a Young British Artist. \u201cIt was a media tag and meant my work got misunderstood.\u201d", "That tag and the perception of her as a YBA ladette contrived to make her seem what she was not: a mere exhibitionist making what Donald Trump lackey Rudy Giuliani dismissed as \u201csick stuff\u201d. My Bed, her 1998 sculpture, featured used condoms, an apple core, Rizlas, lube, vodka bottles and other detritus, on a crumpled and clearly well used bed. \u201cIt was a conceptual work,\u201d she says, \u201cnot flaunting my dirty laundry.\u201d Although it did literally include her dirty laundry.", "But there\u2019s more going on in Emin\u2019s oeuvre than self-disclosure or uncomfortably honest realism. Art helps Emin submit the mess of life to artistic order. Consider Insomnia, the suite of photographs she took over four years when she was going through the menopause. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep so I started taking pictures in my room. Eventually I took one of myself and thought, \u2018I look terrible.\u2019 So I tried to take better ones. After a while, I got loads that I thought were really interesting. I wasn\u2019t a victim of something any more, I was doing something.\u201d The world has got less misogynistic in the past 20 years, she reckons. \u201cEarlier in my career, I could have done a piece about periods maybe, but the menopause? Forget it.\u201d", "\u2018Munch never had a mother so I\u2019m giving him one\u2019 \u2026 a model for The Mother, Emin\u2019s giant statue to be installed in Oslo harbour by the Munch Museum. Photograph: Tracey Emin, copyright the artist", "Neither My Bed nor Insomnia will be exhibited in London but both will be shown when the exhibition transfers to Oslo. Missing, too, from the RA show is a bronze sculpture I\u2019d really been looking forward to seeing, just because of its title. There Was So Much More of Me was due to be installed outside the RA\u2019s Burlington Gardens entrance, but roadworks have made that impossible. Shame: I\u2019d love to have seen the crouching Emin\u2019s bronze buttocks enlivening Mayfair. Emin knows that works in the show will be seen in the context of her cancer, but anyone thinking that the title of that sculpture is a reference to her body now would be mistaken. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable,\u201d she says, \u201c but I did all these works before I got sick.\u201d", "Oslo rather than London will also get Emin\u2019s biggest artwork ever: a seven-metre tall bronze called The Mother, depicting her mum Pam who died in 2016. It\u2019s currently being forged in Stoke on Trent and will be installed on Oslo\u2019s Museum Island opposite the Munch Museum. \u201cMunch never had a mother,\u201d she says, \u201cso I\u2019m giving him one.\u201d", "Before Emin joins friends and academicians who\u2019ve arrived for a private view, she talks politics. She defends voting for David Cameron. \u201cHe legalised gay marriages. His mistake was to think that the British people are kind. He underestimated their stupidity and greed over the EU. But when I voted for him, I got called a Tory cunt. People are horrible.\u201d Leaving the EU was folly, she says. \u201cWe need to come together now. You know this,\u201d she says, pointing to her mask, \u201cand this,\u201d she adds, pointing to her stoma bag, \u201cwere made in Germany. We won\u2019t get them so quickly now we\u2019re out.\u201d", "She thinks Theresa May would have been better at dealing with Covid than Boris Johnson. And she\u2019s exasperated with anyone who thinks the electoral fiasco in the US is democracy in action. \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t a democracy. It may have been once, but now it\u2019s not even a joke. It\u2019s pitiful.\u201d", "\u2018Men tend to tail off as they get older. Women often keep going and do their best work after 50\u2019 \u2026 Emin in 2018. Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images", "She heads off to make a speech to her guests. People have been commiserating with her, she says, about the show not opening to the public. \u201cI say, \u2018Guess what? I\u2019m going to see it.\u2019\u201d The remark captures Emin\u2019s artistic iconoclasm: showing her work to the public is incidental to what\u2019s really important to her \u2013 making art and taking pleasure in the results.", "Before we finish the interview, Emin eyes me cheekily and says: \u201cMen only ejaculate once, but women have multiple orgasms.\u201d Excellent, I reply. What are you on about? \u201cMen tend to tail off as they get older. They do their best work between 40 and 50, then they\u2019re done. Women often keep going and do their best work after 50.\u201d", "She wants to emulate those women. She sees her life as a trilogy. \u201cWhen I was 18, I was more honest and had more clarity than I did when I was 35, when I was confused and lost my way. I was a silly twat in some of the things I did \u2013 and a lot of the criticism of me was fair. Now I\u2019m in part three. I\u2019m more mature. I\u2019m softer but tougher. I want to project myself into the future and not think about the past. Regret doesn\u2019t help anyone. I\u2019ve got time now, perhaps 30 years. I want to use them to make my best art.\u201d", "A couple of days after the interview, Emin rings me. She has been sleeping for a good deal of the time since that private view and our interview. \u201cThat\u2019s how remission works,\u201d she says. \u201cGood days and bad days.\u201d She has some good news: that bronze nude There Was So Much More of Me has found a home. It will now be shown from December (lockdown permitting) in a gallery a stone\u2019s throw away from the RA, at White Cube Mason\u2019s Yard. Perhaps she should use the occasion to change the tense of the title: there is so much more to Tracey Emin.
