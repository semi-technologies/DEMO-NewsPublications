Pre-COVID-19, I\u2019d do a daily five-and-a-half-mile run from my Brooklyn apartment to Vogue\u2019s office building in the financial district. I\u2019ve run through all sorts of depressing climes, from freezing rain and sleet to snow. In my early days of running in the cold, without any sort of knowledge of what to wear, I\u2019d pile on whatever I could find in my closet. The mashed-up outfit usually consisted of a T-shirt, three long-sleeve shirts, two hoodies, and if it was particularly frigid, I\u2019d wear my old puffer coat from high school. Thanks to my piled-on gear, for a while, I was the butt of many jokes made by my run club teammates.", "Fast-forward a year later and I\u2019m still running every morning through the same elements, albeit more protected and looking less like the Pillsbury Doughboy. I\u2019ve learned how to streamline my running uniform so it is simple, and well, not as bulky. So where to start? Support! While I don\u2019t wear a bra in my everyday life\u2014something I once documented for Vogue, I do indeed wear a sports bra to run. I rotate between standard bras, like a stretch piece of cotton support from Fruit of the Loom, and a more high-tech version from Nike or Lululemon.", "Next comes the start to my epic layering routine. I like to look like Lara Croft from Tomb Raider, and prefer pieces that are mostly black. First, I wear a base layer. My fellow runner and professional run coach, Jes Woods, who casually runs 100-mile races (yes, 100) says this is the most important step. \u201cYou want this to be tight and wicking material, so avoid cotton. Cotton is going to get wet and damp quickly and stay wet and damp,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the temperature is in the 30s or colder, you can start to layer on top of the base layer with an insulating top and/or a jacket.\u201d I swear by Uniqlo\u2019s Heattech long-sleeve shirt, which allegedly does the things that Woods says. My colleague, beauty and living editor Ella Riley-Adams, prefers a hood-embedded version from Patagonia.", "After the all-important base layer, I typically wear a thin zip-up. I like Nike\u2019s iteration of this item because it has thumb holes that allow the sleeves of my shirt to act like a half-glove. After that, I put on a fleece zip-up, which I\u2019ve dubbed my \u201cinsulating layer.\u201d If I am truly bracing for the cold, I wear a Hanes hoodie\u2014black, of course\u2014on top of that. To keep my body heat radiating, I top it all off with an insulating black puffer jacket, far from my bubble silhouette that I was wearing years ago."], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei", "Alexis Bennet"], "keywords": ["layering", "running", "wear", "cotton", "run", "layer", "ive", "insulating", "cold", "13step", "start", "id", "routine"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
