Yesterday, Jennifer Lopez hit the streets of Manhattan to do a little bit of pre-Christmas shopping, presumably buying some gifts for the loved ones in her life. To do so, she rocked a casual-cool outfit\u2014her signature aesthetic\u2014that was all about wearing comfortable but elevated pieces. Her oversized camel coat by Max Mara, for instance, kept her warm and polished, as did her black turtleneck and leather leggings.", "Her accessories were also the perfect blend of high and low, proving the best ensembles are the ones that marry both worlds. In this case, she paired a classic uptown bag with a cooler downtown shoe. In her hand, she lugged around a huge Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag in black, the ultimate designer status item. Juxtaposed against this ladies-who-lunch bag, however, was a hefty pair of platform hiker boots\u2014something you\u2019d more likely see in the Lower East Side than on the Upper. The edgier shoe grounded the look and made it seem less precious, and more laissez-faire. Equally as cool? Her large, \u201970s-style tinted shades, which finished off the fit with a groovy twist. She sure loves a sleazy sunglasses moment."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["bag", "ones", "yesterday", "downtown", "warm", "shopping", "jennifer", "worlds", "youd", "wearing", "uptown", "black", "pairs", "shoe", "lopez"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
