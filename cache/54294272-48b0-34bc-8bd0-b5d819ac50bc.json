Che even went so far as to sip from a drink as he delivered jokes on the subject.", "STARS WHO HAVE ENDORSED BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT", "They began the segment by playing videos of people throughout New York City taking to the streets to celebrate the news that Trump was defeated.", "\u201cAnd this is Trump\u2019s home town,\u201d Jost said. \u201cCan you imagine, you get fired from your job, you go back home and everyone in your own house is like \u2018boo, you suck!\u2019\u201d", "He went on to show footage of other countries celebrating.", "\u201cThat\u2019s real, do you know how bad you have to be for Paris to ring church bells when you lose? They didn\u2019t even do that for the real hunchback\u2019s funeral,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole world is celebrating like World War II just ended.\u201d", "Jost continued by showing a picture of Trump golfing, which is what the president was doing when major networks called the race in Biden\u2019s favor.", "\"And I know this isn\u2019t really the same as defeating the Nazis, but it did end with a fascist leader hiding in a bunker,\u201d he said.", "Che compared the feeling in America to the scene in the movie \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d in which the prisoners, despite still being incarcerated, take a break from work and drink beer like everything is OK.", "WHAT HOLLYWOOD HAS SAID ABOUT BIDEN AND TRUMP", "Jost took control of the segment again to make a point about the voter numbers Trump got in 2020 compared to what he did in his 2016.", "\u201cI just want to point something out real quick, remember in 2016 when he lost the popular vote to Hillary by 3 million, he blamed in on illegal immigrants sneaking in and voting? Well, this time he\u2019s going to lose by 5 million votes, which, by his own logic, means Trump let in 2 million more illegal immigrants and they all voted for Biden,\u201d Jost said.", "The hosts concluded by noting how excited they are to no longer have to listen to Trump once he\u2019s out of office.", "\u201cThe most important thing about Donald Trump losing this election is that pretty soon we\u2019ll never have to listen to Donald Trump again,\u201d Jost concluded. \u201cWe may want to listen sometimes for entertainment, just like we might want to slow down to get a better look at a burning car, but we don\u2019t have to. Before Trump was president, no one ever cared what he said. No one was ever like \u2018oh, I wonder what the least successful real-estate developer in New York thinks about this.\u2019 In three months, Trump will just be another guy yelling conspiracy theories in the background.\u201d", "With that, the duo kicked things over to Kate McKinnon, who appeared as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. In an outlandish speech, McKinnon outlined the campaign\u2019s plans to challenge the results, joking that part of the strategy will be to determine which mail-in ballots were real and which were tortillas by eating them.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER", "As for what happens to him after the administration is finished, McKinnon's Giuliani seemed optimistic.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "\u201cI will be fine.
