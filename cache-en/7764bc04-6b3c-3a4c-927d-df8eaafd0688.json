Outside, his mother cooks breakfast over an open fire.", "A few miles across New Delhi, the world\u2019s most polluted capital, 11-year-old Aamya finally gives in to her mom\u2019s coaxing. She climbs out of bed and treads down the hall, past an air purifier that shows the pollution levels in glowing numbers.", "The air is relatively clean in Aamya\u2019s apartment in Greater Kailash II, one of Delhi\u2019s upper-middle-class neighborhoods. Well-fitted doors and windows make the home more airtight, and its rooms purr with the sound of three purifiers that scrub dangerous particles from the air.", "Monu\u2019s neighborhood Aamya\u2019s neighborhood", "Monu breathes fouler air. He lives in a hut in a slum near the Yamuna River, which itself is seriously polluted. This morning, he sits in the open entryway to his house, drinking milky tea. He is the seventh of nine children and watches as one of his brothers coughs and huddles for warmth near the family\u2019s wood-burning clay stove.", "Yamuna River Monu\u2019s house NEW DELHI Aamya\u2019s house Yamuna River Monu\u2019s house NEW DELHI Aamya\u2019s house", "Air pollution killed more Indians last year than any other risk factor, and Delhi is among the most polluted cities in the country. But the burden is unequally shared.", "Children from poor families in Delhi spend more of their lives outdoors. Their families are more likely to use wood-burning stoves, which create soot. They can\u2019t afford the air filters that have become ubiquitous in middle-class homes. And often, they don\u2019t even think much about air pollution, because they face more pressing threats, like running out of food.", "Money can buy a family less exposure to Delhi\u2019s deadly pollution \u2014 but only to a point. Air purifiers and well-sealed rooms can do only so much. Though precise estimates are impossible, even well-off kids like Aamya could lose roughly a year of life because of the amount of toxic air they breathe. And Aamya has asthma, so her parents are especially concerned.", "Still, over the course of one day, Monu was exposed to about four times as much pollution as Aamya. A long-term, consistent disparity like that could steal around five years more life from someone in Monu\u2019s position, compared with an upper-middle-class child like Aamya.", "We know Monu was exposed to more pollution, because we measured it.", "Working with researchers from ILK Labs, on Dec. 3 of last year, journalists with The New York Times tracked how much air pollution the two children were exposed to over the course of a single day.", "As Monu and Aamya went about an otherwise ordinary school day, we followed them with cameras and air-quality monitors that measured how much fine particulate matter was in the air they breathed at any given moment. Known as PM2.5, these are tiny toxic particles, especially dangerous because they can infiltrate the bloodstream.", "Monu and Aamya have never met, but their families know about each other. Their parents agreed to participate in this report after we explained what we could learn by measuring the pollution exposure of children from different backgrounds. Aamya\u2019s mother said she hoped it would help raise awareness about the greater health risks faced by families with fewer resources.", "We could see the difference in the quality of the air they breathed, just from the filters in their pollution monitors.", "Aamya\u2019s air filter Monu\u2019s air filter Aamya\u2019s air filter Monu\u2019s air filter Photos of the small filters that were inside the children\u2019s pollution monitors.", "The pollution in Delhi has an almost physical presence.", "You can see it, a haze just up the street. You can smell it, like an acrid campfire, and you can taste it on your tongue. It can make your eyes burn, your throat itch and your head pound. The tiny particles floating in the air increase the risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks. They can damage your liver and brain.", "Some of the particles are composed of very poisonous materials like arsenic and lead. Other components may be less toxic in and of themselves, but their cumulative effect is another matter. With alarming regularity, researchers release new findings on the many ways air pollution harms the human body.", "Soon after our reporting, the coronavirus pandemic struck.", "Pollution levels plummeted this spring during India\u2019s strict lockdown, producing a rare sight in the city: pure blue skies. Sadly, this was short lived. Once the lockdown lifted in summer, the pollution came back. And now, as winter bears down, the air pollution across India is once again hitting hazardous levels.", "Doctors worry that the toxic air is making the virus even deadlier. Exposure to high levels of pollution causes inflammation of the airways, which makes people more prone to all kinds of infections.", "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing it happen in front of us,\u201d said Dr. Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon and founder of the Lung Care Foundation in New Delhi. \u201cA lot of people are coming to hospitals from the periphery areas where population density and pollution levels are very high.\u201d", "It is a reminder, if one were needed, that not everyone breathes the same air.", "\u201cThe rich can have the best quality air purifiers,\u201d Dr. Kumar said. \u201cThe poor can\u2019t.\u201d", "The pollution hung gray in the air the morning we drove to Monu and Aamya\u2019s homes. Government measurements put fine particulate matter at 130 micrograms per cubic meter \u2014 five times worse than the World Health Organization says is safe. But locals said it was a good day for air quality. Understandable, since the most polluted day there last year measured four times worse.", "", "", "This chart shows each child\u2019s day of pollution exposure. Aamya is represented by the yellow line. There were abrupt transitions as she moved in and out of rooms with purified air throughout the day. Monu\u2019s is shown in orange. His day consistently exposed him to more pollution. The differences were most pronounced early in the morning, as the children got ready for school.", "Aamya and Monu started their morning commute through the smog.", "Monu rode his bike to a free open-air school under a bridge, about five minutes from his house down a dusty road. He likes physical activity, and he wants to be an officer in the Indian Army when he grows up.", "Aamya likes sports, too, but she wants to be a musician.

Very few wore one while we were there, because it was not considered a bad day.", "A large air filter in the basement of Aamya\u2019s school", "Monu\u2019s school is free \u2014 but it has neither walls nor doors. For these students, the outside air was the inside air. Volunteer teachers struggled to be heard as metro trains thundered overhead every five minutes.", "", "", "Aamya\u2019s pollution exposure spiked the moment she stepped foot outdoors that morning. But it dropped again once she slipped through the doors of her school. Monu, too, enjoyed cleaner air when he left behind the wood fires of his neighborhood. But at school, his levels still stayed higher than Aamya\u2019s.", "All morning, while Monu was in class, cars and motorbikes whizzed past on the street next to his school, kicking up dust and clogging the air with exhaust fumes. Aamya\u2019s school had air purifiers in every room, linked together through a phone app that administrators monitored constantly.", "Both Monu and Aamya sound fatalistic.", "\u201cIt will keep increasing,\u201d Monu says. \u201cIf we have 10 sick kids today, it\u2019ll be 20 tomorrow. Lots of people will get sick, and their parents and doctors will say that it\u2019s because of the pollution.\u201d", "Aamya thinks that the government is to blame, and that one person can\u2019t make much of a dent in the problem.", "\u201cThere are a lot of trees, which are not helping that much,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat my teacher says is that we can make a difference. But I don\u2019t believe in that, because we have tried a lot.\u201d", "In the afternoon, after lunch at home, Monu went to another school, which he does every weekday. The outdoor pollution levels began to fall, as they do on most days when the morning traffic clears up and the winds shift.", "There is no single cause of India\u2019s pollution problem \u2014 and no single solution.", "But Indians have learned to count on one thing: Fall and winter are pollution seasons. As air temperatures dip and wind speeds drop, pollutants concentrate over India\u2019s cities, especially in the north, which lies in the shadow of the Himalayas. The mountain range forms a barrier that cuts down air movement even further.", "New Delhi Jaipur Kanpur Patna Kolkata INDIA Mumbai Hyderabad Pollution levels across India 0 75 150 Bangalore Micrograms of fine particulate matter per cubic meter in 2016 | Source: NASA New Delhi Jaipur Kanpur Patna Kolkata INDIA Mumbai Hyderabad Pollution levels across India 0 75 150 Bangalore Micrograms of fine particulate matter per cubic meter in 2016 | Source: NASA New Delhi Jaipur Kanpur Kolkata INDIA Mumbai Pollution levels in India 0 75 150 Bangalore Micrograms of fine particulate matter per cubic meter in 2016 | Source: NASA", "The pollutants themselves come from multiple sources.", "By some estimates, vehicle exhaust accounts for around 20 to 40 percent of the PM2.5 in New Delhi, which is notorious for its traffic. Household fires and industrial emissions also play a role. And as the weather cools in the fall, farmers in rural areas burn remains from their crops, sending up huge clouds of black smoke that drift for miles and settle over the city.", "The end result is that the city\u2019s smog is some of the thickest in the world.", "India\u2019s government has not made battling pollution a priority. Many officials see it as a price they are willing to pay for rapid economic growth, which has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.", "Outrage is not always easy to find on the street, either, no matter how smog-shrouded. Environmental activists say most people have no idea about how bad it really is.", "\u201cWe are talking about people who grew up in rural areas and they come to the city with no preparation,\u201d said Ravina Kohli, a member of My Right to Breathe, a nationwide clean air group. \u201cWhen they see polluted air, they don\u2019t even think it is polluted.\u201d", "There is also little data on how socioeconomic disparities may worsen pollution exposure in New Delhi, according to Pallavi Pant, a staff scientist at the Health Effects Institute. \u201cWe aren\u2019t putting a careful enough lens on people\u2019s occupation, or where they live, or what their socioeconomic status is,\u201d she said.", "Clearly, money helps.", "Aamya\u2019s parents, for example, have managed to shield her from some of the pollution. But it isn\u2019t nearly enough.", "In fact, researchers say, there is no amount of personal spending that can fix the problem.

But Aamya\u2019s exposure rises in the evening, too. As Aamya settles into bed, the level of fine particles in her house approaches 100 micrograms per cubic meter, her highest reading of the day. Still, Monu\u2019s exposure that evening is far higher, spiking dramatically as families all around him light open fires to cook their meals and stay warm.", "Monu\u2019s mother, Ranju, never thinks about air pollution, she says. When asked about it, she laughs, waving her hand dismissively and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the least of my worries.\u201d Her day, after all, is long and hard, beginning at 4 a.m. and going until 10 at night.", "Monu\u2019s family has no running water, so it\u2019s up to Ranju to fetch the water every day from a hand pump.
