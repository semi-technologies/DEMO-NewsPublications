That assumption is not correct. Yes, the game is a great showpiece for the PS5\u2019s DualSense controller, applying its haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and motion-sensing technology to a variety of inventive situations. But Astro\u2019s Playroom is much more than a tutorial; it\u2019s a joyful and polished platformer that ushers in a new generation of PlayStation hardware with a big smile.", "Astro is a cute little robot that runs, hops, and flies across colorful worlds \u2013 each based on different components of the PS5. You splash around in the cooling unit, soar through the SSD, and explore the GPU forest. Like other mascot platformers, you also need to collect things along the way, some of which are floating in plain sight while others require some minor effort to obtain. In terms of basic structure and mechanics, Astro\u2019s Playroom is not surprising; it adheres closely to a comfortable formula. But that familiarity doesn\u2019t drag the experience down, because the DualSense controller adds novelty in fun and surprising ways.", "Every function and feature of the controller gets a little time in the spotlight. Pervasive and distinct rumble effects steal the show, from the tiny sensation of Astro\u2019s footsteps to thundering moments like an Indiana Jones-style boulder chase. The triggers offer resistance as you charge your jumps in a frog suit or operate the levers on a toy machine. Sliding your finger across the touchpad lets you direct your movement as you roll around in a ball. The list goes on, and while some mechanics feel like gimmicks (steering with motion controls will never be fun), the majority of them are cool. Even more than that, they make a substantial difference in your connection to the action, conveying an amazing tactile sense of the world.", "But as I said, Astro\u2019s Playroom isn\u2019t just a shallow excuse to show off the DualSense. Even without the tech behind it, it\u2019s an enjoyable platformer with a satisfying mix of variety and charm, and all the levels set themselves apart in unique ways. Some have an open-world playground feel, where you search every corner for hidden areas and collectibles. Light combat against a small selection of enemies keeps you from having totally free rein, but these levels are more about exploration than aggression. I had fun hunting down the treasures and interacting with the environment, though everything is attainable and obvious enough that I hesitate to call them \u201cpuzzles.\u201d", "Other stages are linear platforming challenges that use Astro\u2019s laser-powered hover-jump. These portions are also pretty forgiving, with generous checkpoints and obstacles that provide just enough resistance to make you pause a moment, but not so much that you get stuck. You also find various suits and vehicles in sections that have you scaling walls or navigating deep space; these are the parts that feel the most gimmicky and unreliable, but even so, they are rarely long enough to cause any real frustration. Plus, it\u2019s hard to get too mad with the game\u2019s infectiously upbeat soundtrack going in the background.", "Even though Astro\u2019s Playroom is relatively simple, it kept me entertained for about five hours with its array of challenges and entertaining Easter eggs. During Astro\u2019s jaunt through the guts of the PS5, you run across all sorts of PlayStation references and memorabilia. From seeing bot versions of iconic characters (like Kratos and Solid Snake) to gathering old peripherals and consoles, the journey is full of \u201cI recognize that!\u201d flashes that punctuate the lighthearted and approachable gameplay.", "At its best, Astro\u2019s Playroom recaptures the magic of my favorite Lego video games \u2013 except the license on display is the PlayStation brand instead of something like Star Wars or Marvel. The cameos are plentiful and amusing, with franchises that go beyond the first-party catalogue, along with some surprisingly deep cuts that made me feel very old. But in the midst of all that history, Astro feels like an adorably fresh face; I\u2019m glad to see the character break out of the confines of VR and reach out to a broader audience. Astro\u2019s Playroom may not be the deepest or most ambitious game on PS5, but its humor and playfulness are just delightful."], "authors": ["Online Content Director", "Joe Joined The Game Informer Staff In He Loves Final Fantasy", "Mass Effect", "The Elder Scrolls", "Assassin'S Creed", "Metal Gear.
