Miller advocates awe, proclaiming God\u2019s presence in all nature. But he doesn\u2019t see God within himself. He aims to reason to happiness.", "Comparing Arthur\u2019s last journal entry to the following quote from Miller\u2019s final treatise reveals the significance of what Arthur learns.", "\u201cOh, the lot of the fool, who aspires to be more. Ours is the most humiliating of burdens\u201d", "Unlike Arthur, Miller cannot connect with the love found in feeling. He is obsessed with man\u2019s rational limitations.
