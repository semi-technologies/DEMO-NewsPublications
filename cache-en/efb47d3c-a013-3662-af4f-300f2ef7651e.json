Forget the runways; what did people actually buy and wear? More often than not, the must-haves can be explained by major headlines or moments in pop culture. But in 2020, a year marked by a global health crisis, staggering unemployment, and a contentious election, what we liked and bought arguably meant even more.

A surprise restock in July reportedly sold out in seconds, and the resulting frenzy became almost as newsworthy as the bags themselves. The tote got another boost when Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wore it on Capitol Hill; according to Lyst, searches for Telfar spiked 163% the following week. GQ called it \u201cfashion diplomacy done right\u201d and pointed out how Telfar\u2019s slogan, \u201cnot for you\u2014for everyone,\u201d jibes nicely with AOC\u2019s own beliefs.", "Telfar handbag $269 VESTIAIRE COLLECTIVE Shop Now", "Photo: DNCC", "ByChari\u2019s Vote necklace", "We\u2019ve learned to expect great fashion choices from former first lady Michelle Obama, and this year was no different.

It was designed by Chari Cuthbert, a Jamaican designer based in Los Angeles, and it retails on her site for $295. The election is (finally!) over, but women are still ordering it.

Created by Alex Posen, formerly the creative director of her brother Zac\u2019s ready-to-wear label, and her friend Dahna Goldstein, the Vote masks have been worn by influential women including Hillary Clinton, Jill Biden, and Stacey Abrams. They made a blunt statement IRL and on Instagram at a time when many of us couldn\u2019t gather to discuss the issues.

Lyst put the chunky two-strap sandal at number two on its list of the top 10 most-wanted items of the year, with a nod to Proenza Schouler, Valentino, and Rick Owens, who have all collaborated with the German shoemaker.

When he wore a JW Anderson color-block cardigan during a Today Show rehearsal, the $1,479 sweater sparked an interesting TikTok trend: Crochet enthusiasts made their own versions of it, with some videos amassing hundreds of thousands of views. Anderson encouraged the fun by sharing the original pattern on his website, telling Vogue Business: \u201cI quite like that we designed something that has taken on a new type of meaning, a new life.

It may just be the thing that defines 2020 fashion the most.
