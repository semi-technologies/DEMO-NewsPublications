Survey the British media landscape and you\u2019ll find some answers. Two years ago Nick Ferrari, presenter of LBC\u2019s flagship show, was on a Sky News panel with my colleague Afua Hirsch. She had eloquently questioned the glorification of British historical figures guilty of racist crimes. \u201cWhy do you stay in this country?\u201d Ferrari responded. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that I see you each Thursday \u2026 but if it offends you so much, how do you manage to stay here?\u201d", "Phrases such as \u201cGo back to where you came from\u201d have long been a staple cry of the street-level racist. For a national radio presenter to evoke this line of questioning because someone dared to critique the nation\u2019s chequered history should have been a moment of scandal, but it wasn\u2019t. Some spoke out, but most did not. Ferrari remains a respectable broadcaster, who continues to collect awards for his work. His example isn\u2019t isolated. Last year, Tom Newton Dunn, then the Sun\u2019s political editor, published a far-right conspiracy theory partly sourced from neo-Nazi websites featuring links between leftwing figures (including me) and \u201cillegal terror organisations\u201d. The article was simply deleted after publication, no explanation given. Newton Dunn\u2019s career flourishes, and his colleagues and peers remain silent.", "This brings us to an episode this week involving Keir Starmer. All Labour leaders must confront a dilemma unless, like Tony Blair, they strike a Faustian pact with Murdoch\u2019s media empire in exchange for abandoning policies that would profoundly redistribute wealth and power. According to the former Barack Obama and Conservative party adviser Jim Messina, the average voter spends four minutes a week thinking about politics. If you are seeking to reach broad swaths of the electorate, engaging with the mass media \u2013 which is likely to set the terms of debate for those precious four minutes \u2013 is an unavoidable necessity, which led Jeremy Corbyn himself to once write a column for the Telegraph.", "These are the considerations Starmer\u2019s team undoubtedly weighed up when they decided to accept an invitation to appear on Ferrari\u2019s LBC show on a monthly basis. But this week something happened that should perhaps make them reconsider. A caller named as \u201cGemma\u201d phoned in to supposedly defend her husband booing Millwall players after they took a knee. She proceeded to deliver talking points of white supremacist propaganda, claiming \u201cracial inequality is now against the indigenous people of Britain, because we are set to become a minority by 2066\u201d, and asking why, as a \u201cwhite British female\u201d, she did not have the same rights as those enshrined by Israel\u2019s 2018 \u201cnation-state law\u201d \u2013 which stated that \u201cthe right to exercise national self-determination\u201d in Israel is \u201cunique to the Jewish people\u201d, and which was met with cries of \u201capartheid\u201d by Israeli Arab parliamentary representatives when it was passed.", "Neither Ferrari nor Starmer rebutted what was effectively the white supremacist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory on national radio, with the Labour leader merely responding \u201cwe all have those rights\u201d and defending taking a knee as \u201crecognising some injustices have been going on for a very long time\u201d.", "This failure angered several black and minority ethnic Labour MPs, both privately and publicly: Norwich South\u2019s Clive Lewis called it \u201cfrankly appalling\u201d, while Luton North\u2019s Sarah Owen declared that the \u201cidea of \u2018indigenous people\u2019 of Britain and use of this term, especially by far right, needs to be challenged at every point\u201d. In a statement, Starmer rejected the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d the caller espoused.", "There are multiple explanations for Starmer\u2019s failure, some more generous than others: that he was caught off guard (unfortunate for a forensic lawyer); that he believed engaging such a person in a prolonged discussion was counterproductive; or that he believed passionately rebutting her would somehow alienate the socially conservative voters Labour needs to attract. Whatever the reason, a failure to confront far-right extremism when broadcast to a mass audience leaves it emboldened and legitimised. An effective, robust response \u2013 such as when John McCain confronted a Republican voter who called Obama an \u201cArab\u201d \u2013 could have become an educational moment in how to confront white supremacy. Some claim Starmer sidestepped a \u201cculture war\u201d trap, but he did address the lesser \u201cculture war\u201d point about taking a knee. It was just the far-right extremism that went without rebuttal.", "But another significant argument is why Starmer should appear on Ferrari\u2019s show at all. We can readily accept that callers such as \u201cGemma\u201d represent an extreme element in Ferrari\u2019s audience while doubting his audience offers a rich crop of floating voters. It is a truism \u2013 accepted by commentators on left and right \u2013 that the voters who have abandoned Labour are socially conservative but economically rooted on the left. But unless Labour wishes to alienate younger progressive voters who lack the natural partisan loyalties of previous generations, conceding to the right on social issues is a no-go. Instead, an economic prospectus that is convincing and compelling enough to override socially conservative objections must be offered.", "A platform such as Ferrari\u2019s LBC show can never do that: it will always offer up a platter of \u201cculture war\u201d traps. Starmer has so far had an infinitely easier ride in the media than his predecessor; yet the next election remains distant, and the Tories retain a polling lead. Ferrari is not Starmer\u2019s friend, and nor should he be. But above all else, this approach holds little promise in winning back Labour\u2019s lost tribes, while conferring legitimacy on prejudices that deserve unequivocal challenging and nothing else.", "\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"], "authors": ["Owen Jones"], "keywords": ["white", "rightwing", "ferrari", "labour", "media", "starmer", "wary", "wants", "right", "ferraris", "week", "war", "conservative", "culture", "voters"], "pubDate": "2020-12-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
