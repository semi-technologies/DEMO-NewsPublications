Day-one software may not be the most robust, but early adopters can still tear into games like Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Demon\u2019s Souls, and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla. Not so fast, though. Before we dive into dessert, we still have some tasty looking entrees left on the plate in the form of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One games that still haven\u2019t released.", "These games not only have yet to launch but have also been floating in development purgatory. I\u2019m talking about projects we either haven\u2019t heard from in years or have simply been delayed repeatedly with no clear end goal. Before we kick off next-gen in earnest, here\u2019s a reminder of some easy-to-forget projects still waiting in the wings for your current consoles.", "Lost Soul Aside \u2013 PlayStation 4", "This slick-looking action game blends Devil May Cry-esque stylish combat with the visual trappings of a Final Fantasy title (Noctis look-alike protagonist included). It turned heads in 2016, not only for how sharp it looked but primarily because it was developed, at the time, by a single person: Bing Yang. The game impressed Sony enough that it scooped up the game as a timed PS4-exclusive. Lost Soul Aside continued to look promising in subsequent trailers and playable demos (read our PSX impressions) but the game blew past projected release windows and updates have been scarce for some time.", "The most recent tweet from the game\u2019s Twitter account is from March \u2013 the beginning of the pandemic in the west. It simply states that Yang and his team, who are based in China, are healthy and safe. A pinned Tweet from October 2019 shows off \u201cnew\u201d concept art. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Lost Soul Aside simply transitioned over to PlayStation 5 at this point. Regardless of where it ends up, we can\u2019t wait to play the finished product.", "Wild \u2013 PlayStation 4", "Also known as \u201cthat neat animal game with the giant snake lady,\u201d it\u2019s been a good while since we\u2019ve seen Wild Sheep Studios\u2019 mysterious debut title. This open-world game is the brainchild of Rayman creator Michel Ancel, and it puts players in control of a shaman who can transfer his mind into various wildlife. Take control of birds to soar above enemies! Inhabit a rabbit to sneak around them! You can even summon and ride a bear! Wild first surfaced at Gamescom 2014 but had its bigger and more memorable gameplay showing during Sony\u2019s 2015 Paris Games Week. Since then, it\u2019s been largely quiet. The most recent update of sorts came when Ancel announced his controversial departure from the game industry in September. He assured fans that Wild would continue and described its development as going \u201csuper well\u201d. Hopefully that\u2019s true, as Wild looks like it could be a delightfully weird and fun time.", "Dead Island 2 \u2013 PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "What even is this game anymore? It was announced at E3 2014 and helmed by Yager before publisher Deep Silver pulled the team off the project in 2015. Crackdown 3 developer Sumo Digital picked up the reins in 2016 only to tag out to Dambuster Studios in 2019. Beyond early demos we hardly saw much of the game during most of these tumultuous years, making many speculate if it still existed at all. A playable, 5-year old build of Dead Island 2 leaked online back in June, giving fans a first-hand sample of what\u2019s unlikely to be the final product at this point. Signs of life appeared in the form of a recent job posting, but it\u2019s wild to think that Dead Island 2 was supposed to be released in 2015; the same year Dying Light arrived and kind of ate its lunch.", "The Last Night \u2013 Xbox One", "Not much is known about this stylish side-scrolling title. It debuted during Microsoft\u2019s 2017 E3 conference with a 2018 release window and is described as a cinematic platformer in a post-cyberpunk world. It looks awesome, but developer Odd Tales hit major snags along the way. Shortly after The Last Night\u2019s reveal, old tweets from founder Tim Soret resurfaced that garnered backlash for expressing anti-feminist views and sympathy for GamerGate. He later apologized and explained he\u2019d since changed his stance. After staffing up and relocating to a new London studio, the team was later slapped with unknown funding and legal issues, jeopardizing the game\u2019s development. As a result, they had to cancel a 2018 Game Awards trailer. The last real update came in January 2019 when Odd Tales announced they were seeking additional funding. It\u2019s unknown if the financial part is worked out or not; the project hasn\u2019t been officially canned, so that\u2019s something. We still don\u2019t know if The Last Night is as fun to play as it is to gawk at, but if Odd Tales can right the ship, we\u2019ll hopefully know sooner than later.", "Skull & Bones \u2013 PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "Speaking of righting ships, Ubisoft\u2019s pirate game has been lost at sea for years. The multiplayer-focused title pits factions of sea dogs against each other in chaotic high-seas skirmishes. That sounds fun enough, but Ubisoft has struggled to nail down Skull & Bones\u2019 vision. It\u2019s been delayed time and again, and that\u2019s happened between long stretches of silence. The beleaguered title most recently skipped September\u2019s Ubisoft Forward event. A blog post stated Skull & Bones needs more time in order to bring a \u201cnew vision\u201d to life. At this point, it\u2019s a race to see if the pirate fantasy releases before its TV adaptation does.", "Dying Light 2 \u2013 PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "\u201cAmbitious\u201d almost undersells everything Dying Light 2 is trying to accomplish. The deep choice/consequence system and sheer world-size has kept Techland plenty busy getting this sequel off the ground. So much so that the studio delayed the game indefinitely at the start of the year. It\u2019s tough to know what\u2019s going on with Dying Light 2, but a great analysis on the topic by our own Liana Ruppert may help shed some light on the matter.", "Biomutant \u2013 PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "Biomutant might hold the title for \u201cCoolest Game You Regularly Forget Is Happening.\u201d Since its 2017 reveal, Biomutant\u2019s gene-splicing customization, vibrant open world, and martial arts combat consistently impresses despite only getting to see it now and again. Every preview basically reads \u201cthis seems rad, no clue when we\u2019ll play it for reals though!\u201d Biomutant seems ambitious as hell, which I imagine has everything to do with how long things are taking. As it stands, the game\u2019s launch is planned for current-gen consoles and PC. A project of that scope seems primed to milk the extra horsepower granted by next-gen hardware too.", "Red Ash: The Indelible Legend \u2013 PlayStation 4, Xbox One", "After Keiji Inafune and his team at Comcept crowdfunded the infamously snake-bitten Mighty No. 9, Red Ash was meant to be its next big follow-up. Despite being billed as a spiritual successor to the beloved Mega Man Legends series, Red Ash fell well short of its Kickstarter goal (roughly $500,000 of its $800,000 asking price). That seemed to be all she wrote, but then Chinese entertainment company Fuze swooped in out of nowhere to fund the rest of the title\u2019s development. While the Red Ash anime managed to see the light of day, little of the game has surfaced beyond some prototype videos and a rough playable demo.", "In 2017 Level-5 acquired Comcept (rebranding the studio to Level-5 Comcept), but Red Ash has been radio silent since. Somehow, the game still hasn\u2019t been officially canceled; it\u2019s strange to think someone, somewhere might be working on this game as we speak. Personally, I\u2019d rather Inafune take a crack at that cute penguin game again.", "Payday 3", "Payday 2 was a huge success for Overkill Studios, so Payday 3\u2019s anticipation was through the roof. Unfortunately, the game\u2019s been in development hell since its existence became known in 2017. The years haven\u2019t been kind to Overkill or its parent company Starbreeze. Highly publicized financial woes have plagued both companies, in part due to the massive failure of Overkill\u2019s The Walking Dead game in 2018. Starbreeze is reported to be on the brink of closure, putting many of its projects up in the air. Thankfully, Overkill recently confirmed the game is still in development and has switched over to the Unreal Engine. With luck, fans can get the gang back together to pull off one more big job.", "So what do you think are the chances some or all of these games appear on next-gen consoles.
