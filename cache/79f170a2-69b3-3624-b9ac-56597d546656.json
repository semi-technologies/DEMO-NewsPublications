Her latest collection, \u201cLove and I,\u201d is further proof of this knowledge. Pragmatic but blessedly na\u00efve\u2014she calls herself \u201cgullible\u201d\u2014Howe\u2019s poetry takes a line-by-line approach to managing existential fear. Her work calls to mind a child\u2019s tactics of self-soothing, like whistling in the dark.", "Howe is an experimental writer nevertheless fascinated by her own belatedness. Her father worked for a time as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,\u2019s clerk. Her mother, an Irish actress and playwright, performed under Yeats\u2019s direction at the Abbey Theatre, in Dublin. (One of Howe\u2019s sisters is Susan Howe, another profoundly original American poet; they may be the most important sibling duo in American poetry.) Shortly after Howe was born, in 1940, her family moved from Buffalo to a railroad flat near Harvard Square, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They made regular Sunday visits to the baronial quarters of Fanny\u2019s grandfather Mark Antony DeWolfe Howe, an arbiter of everything old Boston, who lived in the heart of primordial, purple-paned Beacon Hill. There she was struck by \u201ctables and chairs and objects brought from China generations before,\u201d an ivory pagoda, crystal finger bowls, and Victorian storybooks full of illustrations of \u201ccurly-haired children in pinafores, stone walls, golliwogs, leaping figures with scissors following them to cut off their thumbs, and gardens containing pale but specific flowers.\u201d", "In another poet of Howe\u2019s background\u2014Robert Lowell comes to mind\u2014this aristocratic, late-Victorian milieu might have provoked claustrophobia, yet an aura of wonder pervades Howe\u2019s writing. It is evident in that description of her grandfather\u2019s Victorian children\u2019s books, as well as in her lovely evocation of his stutter, which \u201criveted\u201d her, because it sounded as though \u201chis voice wanted to turn into a musical instrument.\u201d", "Since new in Howe\u2019s work means late, \u201cLove and I\u201d is, in a double sense, Howe\u2019s latest volume. It hurries to join a long and illustrious career, which, besides poetry, includes novels, stories, memoir, and short films. Approaching eighty, Howe, in \u201cLove and I,\u201dis now revisiting the earliest formative impressions of preconscious childhood, when \u201ceverything seemed like something else.\u201d The opening of \u201c1941\u201d is a snapshot of her birthplace:", "On a cold day near Lake Erie", "I was in a double bind.", "The snow was like a lamb", "Shorn in the upper circle.", "The scene is part memory, part dream, assembled from the rudiments of identity just this side of nonexistence. \u201cZero and One sat on either side of me,\u201d she writes. Howe\u2019s poems assert that there is no meaning to be tracked back to an original cause: \u201cNo big bang, no beginning.\u201d They knock \u201cmeaning\u201d off its rational basis and into the realm of hunch and intuition. They must be read not \u201cwith a spyglass / But with a wild guess / And only three words: \u2018You never know.\u2019 \u201d", "Howe prefers the clarity of misunderstanding to the blur of certainty. Like stained glass, her poems await illumination, but it is important not to flood them with a klieg light. They dwell in puzzles and games: \u201cZero and One\u201d brings to mind computer code, and also, via tennis, unlocks her title, \u201cLove and I.\u201d But, although she delights in creating puzzles, she seems wary of solving them: \u201cA central contradiction, once discovered, / Leads to collapse or evolution.\u201d Metaphor is one method of resolving, even while exposing contradiction. Rhyme, which Howe scatters throughout the book, provides another. But there\u2019s nothing here like that line in Frost about a cellar hole \u201cclosing like a dent in dough.\u201d Metaphors sometimes clinch thinking; Howe\u2019s tend to scatter it."], "pubDate": null, "id": "79f170a2-69b3-3624-b9ac-56597d546656", "keywords": ["poetry", "love", "beginnings", "work", "sense", "american", "victorian", "zero", "makes", "fanny", "howes", "howe", "poet", "endings", "writing"], "title": "Fanny Howe Makes Sense of Beginnings and Endings", "summary": "Pragmatic but blessedly na\u00efve\u2014she calls herself \u201cgullible\u201d\u2014Howe\u2019s poetry takes a line-by-line approach to managing existential fear.\nHer work calls to mind a child\u2019s tactics of self-soothing, like whistling in the dark.\n(One of Howe\u2019s sisters is Susan Howe, another profoundly original American poet; they may be the most important sibling duo in American poetry.)\nShortly after Howe was born, in 1940, her family moved from Buffalo to a railroad flat near Harvard Square, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nIt hurries to join a long and illustrious career, which, besides poetry, includes novels, stories, memoir, and short films.", "authors": ["Dan Chiasson", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
