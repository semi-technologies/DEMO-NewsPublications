Four days after sentence was passed, Ruhollah Zam was hanged. The judge said he had spied, incited violence and \u201csown corruption on earth\u201d. Most Iranians took that to mean that he had simply disagreed with the right of the ayatollahs to rule.", "Mr Zam had been a remarkable dissident. In 2011 he went to Paris to escape the regime and, four years later, launched Amad, a news channel on Telegram, a messaging app. At its peak Amad had more subscribers than the BBC \u2019s Persian service, which many Iranians rely on. He exposed the sexual and financial peccadilloes of the regime\u2019s top turbans. The son of an influential cleric and an alumnus of a school in Tehran, the capital, favoured by the elite, he had a wide web of contacts.", "When nationwide protests erupted three years ago, he posted the place and time of rallies and was often first to get videos from the scene. He issued a manual for making petrol bombs. He called for regime change: \u201cRuhollah began the revolution, Ruhollah will end it,\u201d he said, referring first to Ruhollah Khomeini, father of the Islamic revolution, then to himself. The regime blocked Telegram but failed to silence him. Then last year its agents lured him to Iraq, apparently with a honey trap, kidnapped him and took him home.", "Mr Zam\u2019s treatment shows yet again that the regime will stop at nothing to crush civil society. Snipers shoot demonstrators. In September a prominent wrestler was hanged for joining a protest. The hardliners control parliament and the courts, so they can rig next year\u2019s presidential election.", "Human-rights outfits in Europe warn Iranian dissidents abroad against travelling home. \u201cZam is just the beginning,\u201d read a social-media message to an anchor at the BBC \u2019s Persian service in London. \u201cI always look over my shoulder when leaving the office,\u201d she says.", "\u201cHorrifying,\u201d tweeted Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden\u2019s choice for national security adviser. Yet the new administration\u2019s eagerness to curb Iran\u2019s enrichment of uranium may outweigh human rights. On December 16th the parties to the nuclear deal with Iran met on schedule. President Donald Trump pulled America out of the agreement. Mr Biden says he will rejoin it."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["zam", "persian", "irans", "firebrand", "service", "ruhollah", "s", "hanged", "revolution", "death", "telegram", "regime", "abducted", "took", "iran"], "pubDate": "2020-12-16T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
