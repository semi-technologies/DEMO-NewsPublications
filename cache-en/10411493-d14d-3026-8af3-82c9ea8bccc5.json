My 86-year-old mother said he wouldn\u2019t resign, and she was right.\u201d", "Cummings did eventually resign in November after a No 10 power struggle ostensibly unrelated to his lockdown trips. Evans says: \u201cIt would be nice to think he finally resigned because he realised he was wrong about something, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason.\u201d", "It was Cummings\u2019 explanation for the trip that made Barnard Castle synonymous with ludicrous excuses. He said his family \u201cended up\u201d on the outskirts of the town after a journey to test his eyesight.", "\u201cPeople were angry about it because it was a strange reason to give,\u201d admits Richard Bell, one of the town\u2019s four Tory councillors. The saga led to one ministerial resignation; dozens of Tory backbenchers calling for Cummings to quit; a huge drop in public support for the government; and a dip in confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, a sentiment later identified by academics as the \u201cCummings effect\u201d.", "Dominic Cummings\u2019 eyesight test excuse stretched credulity. Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/Shutterstock", "Police complained that lockdown rules became harder to enforce as the public cited Cummings\u2019 behaviour to justify their own rule-breaking. When Lukman Majeed was caught breaking lockdown by travelling with friends from West Yorkshire to Manchester, he told police: \u201cIf the aide to the prime minister can drive 700 miles, we can travel to Manchester to celebrate Eid.\u201d Unlike Cummings, Majeed was fined.", "Back in Barnard Castle, Bell prefers to dwell on the upside: \u201cIt certainly put the town on the map \u2013 local businesses have reported it being a lot busier.\u201d Ever since Cummings\u2019 trip, tourists have flocked to the town for selfies outside the local Specsavers and in front of the town\u2019s \u201cwelcome\u201d sign. The beer maker BrewDog even produced a special edition Barnard Castle Eye Test beer, which sold out twice over.", "\u201cEvery cloud has a silver lining,\u201d says Bell, \u201cand if Specsavers and BrewDog bring people to the town that\u2019s great. People now see the funny side of it.\u201d", "In July, the campaign group Led by Donkeys projected a film on to the walls of the town\u2019s 12th century castle, which lamented the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. In August, the performance artist Sam Edwards travelled to the town with a light box strapped to roof of his car spelling out the Cummings quote: \u201cI behaved reasonably.\u201d", "\u201cThose things were satirical,\u201d says Evans. \u201cWhat Cummings did was never funny. He travelled from somewhere that had a high incidence to somewhere that had a low incidence. Whether there was a transmission, nobody can ever know.\u201d", "It was Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher, who alerted the Guardian and the police to the fact that he had seen Cummings and his family getting into a car on a road on the southern side of the Tees. The sighting proved impossible for Cummings to deny because Lees took down the car registration and had a Google search history of when he\u2019d looked up the numberplate.", "In a statement in Downing Street\u2019s garden, Cummings admitted the trip but said he stayed by the Tees for 10 to 15 minutes and strayed no more than 15 metres from his car.", "This account is challenged by Evans who believes she saw Cummings in the town centre, and gave a statement to that effect to Durham police. It\u2019s also disputed by Alan Gowland, a retired GlaxoSmithKline employee, who says he saw someone he believed to be Cummings on a path by a weir on the other side of the Tees from Lees\u2019 sighting. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been there for just 15 minutes; his walk would have taken longer. He was walking very casually,\u201d says Gowland, who backed Brexit and voted Conservative for the first time in 2019.", "\u201cI think he came here thinking he wouldn\u2019t get noticed. But people follow politics. When I saw him, he looked like he was thinking: \u2018I wonder if he recognises me.\u2019\u201d", "Evans thinks Cummings\u2019 statement was carefully worded only to confirm the undeniable testimony of Lees. \u201cHis account, right from the start, had been incredibly crafted to give the absolute minimum that was already in the public domain,\u201d she says. The discrepancies between Cummings\u2019 account and those of witnesses are a central part of a claim made in October that Cummings perverted the course of justice in the garden statement.", "It is unclear if this will ever be tested in court, as Durham police have shown no appetite to investigate further. A three-day investigation in May found Cummings may have breached health protection regulations, but police took no action. Bell optimistically predicts it will have no impact on the Tory vote in next May\u2019s local election.", "But Evans is not so sure. \u201cIt was a very, very significant occurrence. People have spoken out and it\u2019s not in our nature to speak out, but it\u2019s important to try to get to the truth. People will not forget this.\u201d"], "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "keywords": ["learns", "dominic", "trip", "wont", "castle", "lees", "town", "towns", "visit", "bell", "forget", "lockdown", "cummings", "live", "evans", "notoriety", "barnard"], "pubDate": "2020-12-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
