In February of last year, it announced that Jonathan Stafford, a ballet master who\u2019d been appointed as the interim head, would assume artistic leadership, with Wendy Whelan, a former star ballerina, overseeing programming and commissions as the associate director. Whelan, the first woman to hold a permanent artistic leadership position at the ballet, went on a listening tour of the hundred company members, \u201ctrying to let them know that I see them as more than just a body,\u201d she told me. She was eager to bring in more contemporary choreographers, especially women and people of color. At the start of this year, she was busy commissioning future pieces by such choreographers as Miller, Jamar Roberts, Pam Tanowitz, and Sidra Bell, who was to be the first Black woman to choreograph for the company.", "Plans changed. In March, as the coronavirus spread and N.Y.C.B. projected that cancelling its spring season meant the loss of eight million dollars, it committed to paying its employees through May. The dancers retreated to their apartments or went home to live with their parents, keenly aware that ballet careers don\u2019t last forever. Whelan, whose husband has a heart condition, moved with him to their house upstate. She figured that the company would be back by winter, a lucrative time that includes the cash cow \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d \u201cWe felt a little lucky,\u201d she said.", "By June, it was clear that there would be no fall season, no \u201cNutcracker.\u201d Like the Met, the company made taped performances available for streaming, so that audiences could catch up on \u201cBallo della Regina\u201d from home. There were devastating human losses. Clem Mitcham, the theatre\u2019s longtime head of security, died of COVID complications, as did a member of the marketing staff. The company moved its training courses to Zoom, which opened up unanticipated hurdles. Flooring was an issue. \u201cIf you\u2019re on linoleum or a rug or a wood floor, you can\u2019t really work your footing the same way as if you had a Marley dance floor,\u201d Whelan said. The company sent six-by-six-foot strips of vinyl flooring to each dancer. Teaching online had its benefits, though. \u201cI can actually see everybody on a screen\u2014I don\u2019t have to walk around the room,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cI had a panic attack the first time I did it, but I\u2019ve found a way of kind of loving it.\u201d Her mission had been to help drag the company into the new decade. Now it was simply to keep everyone dancing. Was it possible to do both at the same time?", "During the summer, Lincoln Center asked the company to help \u201cenliven the plaza\u201d by creating a short film for Pride Month. The result was a ballet solo performed in front of the central fountain, which was lit up in rainbow colors. Whelan expanded the idea to the five socially distanced ballet films, corralling four of the choreographers she had already commissioned, as well as Justin Peck, the company\u2019s resident choreographer. Suddenly, bringing in outsiders who had worked on street corners and at other unconventional sites seemed prescient.", "Like Miller, Jamar Roberts was drawn to the reflecting pool as a location. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in tension,\u201d he told me. \u201cI like to imagine that the air is thick. It gives the body more resistance. Or the air is thin, and you slip through it.\u201d His piece, \u201cWater Rite,\u201d a staccato solo for the dancer Victor Abreu, was prompted by a quotation from the jazz saxophonist Archie Shepp. \u201cHe referred to jazz as being a lily that grows in spite of the swamp, meaning that it is a music that comes out of oppression,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI was inspired by that, just thinking of the time that we\u2019re in now. In the midst of such a shitty time, so many beautiful things are being made. Kids are being born. We\u2019re still able to make dance. So this water here represents the swamp, and Victor is the lily.\u201d", "Sidra Bell gravitated to the lawn that swoops up from the plaza to the top of a glass-walled restaurant, overlooking Sixty-fifth Street. Bell had been quarantining in White Plains with her father, the composer Dennis Bell, who wrote a string quartet for her piece. \u201cI was rehearsing in the living room, he was composing in the basement,\u201d she said. Bell has an architect\u2019s eye, and she told me that she wanted to play up \u201cthe rough edges and the angles\u201d of Lincoln Center, as well as the \u201cskewing and warping\u201d of its reflective surfaces. Her piece, \u201cpixelation in a wave (Within Wires),\u201d features four dancers in skintight monochromatic suits, sometimes dancing at different elevations; their rolling backs and sharp movements make them look like statues in a sculpture garden. As in Miller\u2019s piece, two of the dancers are a couple, and they start the piece with a duet. Romantic pairings within the company, a fraught topic in the past few years, are now an unexpected asset."], "authors": ["Michael Schulman", "Michael Schulma", "Michael Avedo"], "keywords": ["pandemic", "roberts", "told", "choreographers", "dancers", "woman", "ballet", "company", "whelan", "bell", "took", "piece", "city", "york"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
