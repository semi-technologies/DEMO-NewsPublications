As the standoff intensifies, he has found a familiar enemy to blame: the 90-year-old financier and philanthropist George Soros.", "Orb\u00e1n has reinvigorated his government\u2019s anti-Soros campaign, which has often been marked by conspiratorial and antisemitic rhetoric, as Hungary and Poland have tussled with other European leaders over the so-called \u201crule-of-law\u201d mechanism. The dispute is holding up final agreement on the EU\u2019s \u20ac1.7tn (\u00a31.5tn) seven-year budget and recovery package.", "On Friday, amid reports that the Polish government may be moving closer to accepting a compromise solution on the budget, Orb\u00e1n stood firm with his veto threat, claiming in a radio interview that the EU wants to accept \u201c35 million migrants\u201d and the rule-of-law mechanism would be a way of punishing him for disagreeing.", "Orb\u00e1n has consistently claimed that European critics are punishing Hungary because of its anti-migrant stance, rather than for well-documented concerns over corruption and rule-of-law.", "The guilty party behind this supposed plan: Soros, of course. \u201cEurope must not succumb to the Soros network,\u201d wrote Orb\u00e1n recently.", "Viktor Orban takes part on a press conference in Lublin, Poland, in September. Photograph: Omar Marques/Getty Images", "Soros was born to a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930, and survived the Holocaust by going into hiding. He later moved to Britain and then the US, where he became one of the world\u2019s richest men through trading and currency speculation. Starting in the late 1980s, he has given away huge portions of his fortune to liberal causes, and even funded Orb\u00e1n and a number of other current Hungarian officials in the late 80s and early 1990s.", "\u201cI supported Orb\u00e1n because at the time he was a very active supporter of open society. But he became an exploiter and the creator of a mafia state,\u201d Soros told the Guardian in an interview last year.", "Soros has been the target of conspiracy theories in many countries for years, but Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government took it to a new level in 2017, with a media campaign that told Hungarians they should not let Soros \u201chave the last laugh\u201d. The government funded billboards in Budapest and other cities featuring Soros as a puppet master.", "In 2018, in the run-up to parliamentary elections, Orb\u00e1n criticised Soros using language that contained textbook antisemitic tropes: \u201cWe are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open, but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.\u201d", "After those elections, which Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party won, the billboard campaigns ceased and mentions of Soros somewhat quietened, but in recent weeks his name has been cropping up ever more frequently.", "Soros has certainly been part of the debate. He wrote an opinion piece last month in which he accused Orb\u00e1n of setting up \u201can elaborate kleptocratic system to rob the country blind\u201d, and called on the EU to ensure it stands up to Hungarian and Polish threats to veto the budget.", "In response, Orb\u00e1n upped the stakes in his rhetorical attacks on Soros, calling him \u201cthe most corrupt man in the world\u201d and claiming Hungary is the victim of shadowy Soros networks.", "The latest bout of Soros-mania has even touched the actor George Clooney, who irritated the Hungarian government when he conflated \u201chate and anger\u201d with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government. In response, pro-government media dug up a photo of Clooney with Soros\u2019s son, and suggested the actor was parroting the billionaire\u2019s talking points. It prompted the actor to release a statement saying he had only met Soros and his son once. \u201cOrb\u00e1n\u2019s propaganda machine is lying,\u201d he said, though he went on to praise the work done by Soros foundations across the world.", "The most disturbing episode of the recent anti-Soros campaign was an article written for a pro-government website by Szil\u00e1rd Demeter, a ministerial commissioner and Orb\u00e1n-appointed museum director. He called Soros a \u201cliberal F\u00fchrer\u201d who wanted to persecute Hungarians and Poles. \u201cToxic gas flows from the capsule of a multicultural open society,\u201d he wrote.", "Even by the standards of official Hungarian discourse on Soros, the outburst was shocking, prompting critical responses from the US and Israeli embassies as well as Jewish organisations, particularly given its target was a Holocaust survivor. In the end, Demeter withdrew the article, though he did not apologise.", "Critics suggest the increasingly inflammatory rhetoric could be a device to deflect attention from the worsening coronavirus situation in Hungary, as well as from the tricky corner Orb\u00e1n is now in with the negotiations in Brussels.", "Hungarian-American investor George Soros attends a press conference at the foreign ministry in Berlin, Germany in 2017. Photograph: Ferdinand Ostrop/AP", "Attention was briefly distracted from the budget negotiations this week when Fidesz MEP and leading Orb\u00e1n confidant J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e1jer resigned after he was detained by police leaving a gay orgy via a drainpipe with drugs in his backpack. It was an awkward scrape for someone who personally rewrote the Hungarian constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution.", "Sz\u00e1jer is another Fidesz official who was once a recipient of a Soros scholarship but has now turned anti-Soros fighter. Perhaps surprisingly, Soros has not yet been blamed for Sz\u00e1jer\u2019s decision to take part in the orgy, though some pro-government media commentators have suggested the incident was a set-up by foreign secret services.", "Negotiations on the EU budget are about to enter a crunch phase. Earlier this week, the European commission warned it could create a new coronavirus recovery fund without the help of Hungary and Budapest, prompting Polish deputy prime minister Jaros\u0142aw Gowin to say on Thursday that a compromise proposal could be possible.", "Orb\u00e1n, however, said on Friday that this would not work.", "\u201cThe Poles cannot back out of the veto; our countries have signed a declaration stating that Hungary and Poland will support each other and will not accept a solution that\u2019s unacceptable to the other,\u201d he said."], "authors": ["Shaun Walker"], "keywords": ["orb\u00e1n", "budget", "turns", "scapegoat", "orb\u00e1ns", "progovernment", "hungary", "soros", "rows", "ruleoflaw", "eu", "familiar", "hungarian", "veto", "george"], "pubDate": "2020-12-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
