On Tuesday, Dobbs began his nightly program by announcing \u201cprogress\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s effort to remain in office and to vanquish \u201cthe insidious, radical Dems, corporate America, Big Tech, and the deep state, who have tried to overthrow his Presidency for more than four years.\u201d Dobbs paused, briefly, and then lambasted Barr for having told the Associated Press earlier in the day that the Justice Department had found no evidence to corroborate Trump\u2019s claims of election theft. \u201cToday, a member of his own Cabinet appeared to join in with the radical Dems, and the deep state, and the resistance,\u201d Dobbs said. \u201cFor the Attorney General of the United States to make that statement, he is either a liar or a fool or both. He may be, um, perhaps, compromised. He may be simply unprincipled. Or he may be personally distraught or ill.\u201d", "Barr\u2019s actions during his tenure as Attorney General may be up for debate, but he is not compromised, distraught, or ill. Nor is he a member of a deep-state coup. There is no deep-state coup. As state and local Republican officials in six battleground states and nearly fifty judges have found, Joe Biden decisively won the 2020 election. Barr\u2019s refutation of Trump\u2019s false claims came late, but, nevertheless, it deserves praise. At long last, the country\u2019s chief law-enforcement officer has defended American democracy. And that, in the waning days of the Trump Presidency, could cost him his job.", "Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, the lawyers for the Trump campaign, immediately issued a statement accusing Barr of failing to seriously examine the President\u2019s claims: \u201cWith all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation.\u201d Online, Barr was vilified. Joe Hoft, at the Gateway Pundit, wrote that Barr had destroyed \u201chis name for all eternity\u201d and claimed that he has spent his time in office working surreptitiously to keep Hillary Clinton, James Comey, and Robert Mueller out of jail. \u201cNow we know why the DOJ didn\u2019t arrest anyone for the past four years,\u201d Hoft wrote. \u201cThe reason is they wanted it this way. . . . They never were going to arrest anyone.\u201d On pro-Trump Reddit channels, Barr was declared a \u201cdeep state\u201d agent. The President was reportedly livid at Barr. Asked at a White House event on Thursday if he still has confidence in Barr, Trump replied, \u201cask me that in a number of weeks from now.\u201d", "What actually motivated Barr is unknown at this point, and nothing is likely to become clearer until after Trump leaves office, on January 20th. This week, an associate of the Attorney General\u2019s told me that Barr and Trump have barely spoken for weeks. The associate said that Barr had intentionally distanced himself from Trump as the election approached, because he wanted to perform the traditional role of Attorneys General\u2014declining to take legal actions during an election season that favor one candidate, particularly the President who appointed them.", "That explanation is charitable. During Barr\u2019s interview with the A.P., he hedged, as he has in the past. He disclosed that, in October, he had secretly appointed John Durham, a federal prosecutor investigating the F.B.I.\u2019s 2016 Trump-Russia probe, as special counsel. That move will please the President and make it more difficult for Biden\u2019s new Attorney General to curtail Durham\u2019s work. Then, after Barr\u2019s comments about the election were attacked, his office released a statement saying, \u201cThe Department will continue to receive and vigorously pursue all specific and credible allegations of fraud as expeditiously as possible.\u201d", "The week\u2019s events exemplified the tragic, destructive, and cynical nature of the Trump-era Justice Department. Barr has clear legal and political convictions\u2014many of which infuriate liberals\u2014but he has pursued them consistently throughout his career. Like other Republicans, he seemingly embraced an alliance of convenience with Trump. An adherent to the obscure legal view that the Presidency has too little power, Barr contends that special-counsel and congressional investigations have become so excessive that they hamper a President\u2019s ability to govern the country.", "Barr viewed the F.B.I.\u2019s 2016 Trump-Russia investigation, the subsequent appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, and the convictions of Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and Roger Stone as illegitimate. He did his best to reverse each of those measures, by undermining Mueller\u2019s report and lessening the punishment of the Trump allies who were successfully prosecuted by Mueller. During Trump\u2019s impeachment, Barr accused Democrats of \u201cwaging a scorched-earth, no-holds-barred war of \u2018Resistance\u2019 against this Administration,\u201d adding, \u201cit is the left that is engaged in the systematic shredding of norms and the undermining of the rule of law.\u201d Critics accused Barr of doing the same, in helping Trump to demolish decades of effort to build public confidence that the law is applied equally to all Americans, regardless of their proximity to the President. They contend that Barr\u2019s politicizing of the Justice Department will lead him to be considered one of the most destructive Attorneys General in modern American history.", "Until now, Barr has delivered virtually everything that Trump could possibly have wanted politically\u2014from the Justice Department arguing that Manhattan prosecutors should not have access to Trump\u2019s tax returns, to defying subpoenas from congressional oversight committees. Those acts and others that Barr has taken set legal precedents that have made Trump one of the most powerful American chief executives, in legal terms, since Congress and the courts curbed Presidential power after Watergate. In the final weeks of the campaign, though, Trump went too far, apparently, even for Barr. In the pursuit of victory and vengeance, Trump publicly called for him to open a criminal investigation of the Biden family, and demanded that Barr announce the results of the Durham investigation in time to sway votes. After the election, Trump\u2019s campaign pressured Barr to become the first U.S. Attorney General to aid a de-facto coup attempt\u2014albeit a chaotic and, at times, comical one.", "Barr\u2019s public defense of Biden\u2019s victory\u2014at a politically existential moment for Trump\u2014was an irreversible step for the Attorney General. If Trump or his allies maintain control of the Republican Party, Barr will now have no future in it. George Terwilliger, who worked for Barr in the Administration of George H. W. Bush, told the Times that Barr\u2019s intention this week was \u201cjust to be responsible.\u201d Terwilliger added that, when false conspiracies are being spread about the Justice Department, \u201cit is responsible to say no, that did not happen.\u201d Barr\u2019s statement showed an Attorney General doing what is required of him in a democracy. It also showed how utterly this President has failed to do the same.", "Read More About the Presidential Transition"], "authors": ["David Rohde", "David Rohd", "Peter Slevi", "Susan B.
