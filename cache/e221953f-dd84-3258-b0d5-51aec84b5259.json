It was something of a rhetorical ask: smell is such a personalized preference, as it\u2019s the one sense that\u2019s linked to our memory more so than any other. \u201cThe way your home smells is very emotional and plays a huge part in how you feel being there,\u201d admits Gorham. \u201cIt creates a sense of comfort and security.\u201d", "Especially in 2020, where the weather outside\u2014and well, the world\u2014is frightful, our homes provide the ultimate respite. And with so many stores closed and restaurants operating at minimal capacity, they've become center of our limited universes. Candles, with their aromatic emissions, can soothe and delight us in our spaces, reminding us of happy memories past. Who doesn\u2019t, say, remember the smell of their mother cooking their favorite meal, or the distinct aroma of grandma\u2019s house?", "Gorham's collection for Ikea is called \u201cOsynlig,\u201d which means \u201cinvisible\u201d in Swedish. While the traditional notion of design evokes the senses of touch and sight, Gorham wanted to explore the architecture of smell\u2014\u201cI feel people just don\u2019t reflect enough when it comes to scent, but smell is a very relevant part of our life and also the home,\u201d he says. Hence the transparent title: sure, you can\u2019t see aromas in an atmosphere, but they play an integral part in forming it.", "Osynlig has 13 scents in total, including Rose and Raspberries, Firewood and Spice, Peach Blossom and Bamboo, and Tobacco and Honey. They run the gamut from fresh to floral to woody, and cost from 5 to 25 dollars. The price point is sure to delight candle aficionados, as a traditional Byredo candle retails around 45 dollars.", "Below, shop our favorite scents from the collection."], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["smell", "homey", "traditional", "swedish", "sense", "aromatic", "sure", "candle", "launched", "founder", "scents", "ikea", "byredos", "gorham", "collection"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
