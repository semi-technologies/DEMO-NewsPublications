She was joined by another volunteer, Elizabeth Woodcock, a fifty-year-old health-care-management consultant. In Georgia, you must be eighteen to vote, but only seventeen and a half to register. Yamamoto and Woodcock decided to see how many seventeen-and-a-half-year-olds they could find. They\u2019d heard that there were twenty-three thousand teens in the state who hadn\u2019t been old enough to vote in November but who would be in January.", "\u201cThat\u2019s, like, twice as many people as Biden won by here,\u201d Yamamoto said. She wore a purple sweatshirt and a burgundy mask. (Woodcock wore a \u201cCount Every Vote\u201d mask.) The two headed toward Decatur Square, a historic walking and shopping district, but, first, they stopped at a Chick-fil-A, where a young man was standing outside. \u201cAre you seventeen and a half?\u201d Woodcock asked him. He shook his head and left to check on his order. They continued on to the square. A group of skateboarders were hanging out under a tree. \u201cHi,\u201d Woodcock said. \u201cAre you guys seventeen and a half?\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d one said, \u201cwe\u2019re much younger. Thank you, though.\u201d", "\u201cThose are my brother\u2019s friends,\u201d Yamamoto said. \u201cThey\u2019re fourteen.\u201d", "They kept walking. \u201cAre you registered?\u201d Yamamoto asked a young man in headphones. \u201cYou already asked,\u201d he replied.", "Turning a corner, Yamamoto bumped into a floppy-haired guy who was wearing a puffy jacket and carrying his own clipboard. His name was Ewan Pritchard, and Yamamoto had recently beaten him in an election for student-body president. \u201cVery fierce competition\u2014very emotional,\u201d Pritchard said. \u201cI didn\u2019t look at the numbers. But I trust the system.\u201d He was walking around with Woodcock\u2019s mother.", "Pritchard, who is eighteen, said that he\u2019d voted for Joe Biden in November: \u201cIt\u2019s fun to be able to finally vote.\u201d", "\u201cI bet,\u201d Yamamoto said.", "\u201cI had to eat a couple of people ahead of me in line, but, yep, I got the last chess set.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Kate Isenberg", "\u201cI have a lot of friends who are just behind the cutoff,\u201d Pritchard went on. He and Yamamoto figured that about a hundred of their classmates might vote, out of the hundred and fifty who\u2019d be old enough. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this,\u201d Pritchard said. \u201cMy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has already gone to colleges,\u201d he added.", "Yamamoto and Pritchard split off from Woodcock and her mom and took a roundabout path back to the school. (\u201cMaybe we can register the parkour guy,\u201d Pritchard said.) They waved to some underclassmen playing soccer, dodged a spewing fire hydrant, and chatted with an elderly woman for a while about pecan trees and God. But they did not find anyone who was seventeen and a half.", "Thirty minutes later, they debriefed with the rest of the team in the school parking lot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any takers,\u201d Yamamoto said. Then she turned to a young man named Miles Havard, her co-student-body president, who was also volunteering: \u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday?\u201d", "\u201cJune 3rd,\u201dHavard said. \u201cOn the day of the registration deadline, I\u2019ll be seventeen and five months and twenty-nine days. One day short.\u201d He shook his head.", "Pritchard began texting classmates in his address book, at random. One, Dominick Calandra, was the right age. \u201cHe\u2019s in the apartments up there,\u201d Pritchard said to the volunteers, pointing a few hundred yards away. He told Calandra to bring his I.D.", "A few minutes later, Calandra, a skinny kid with sagging jeans and tousled hair, arrived with four friends from the senior class. Calandra was the only one who would be newly eligible to vote in January. \u201cWe\u2019re all here to register,\u201d he mumbled, drawing applause from the small crowd of volunteers. Calandra explained how his day had gone. \u201cWorked on some world-history work,\u201d he said. \u201cThen came here.\u201d A girl he\u2019d brought with him added, about the decision to come register, \u201cIt was really convenient, so we figured we might as well.\u201d", "\u201cDo you guys mind if I take a picture for the yearbook?\u201d a young woman asked. They obliged.", "Pens began to scratch paper: the scribble of democracy. Pritchard offered the new registrants some candy. \u201cI\u2019m not super enthusiastic about politics,\u201d Calandra confessed afterward. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthis seems important.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Charles Bethea", "Charles Bethe"], "keywords": ["asking", "asked", "vote", "pritchard", "georgians", "half", "young", "woodcock", "seventeen", "calandra", "register", "yamamoto", "walking"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
