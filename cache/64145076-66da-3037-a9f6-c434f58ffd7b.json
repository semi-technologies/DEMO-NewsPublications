A call to boycott French products, encouraged by Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has also been launched with little effect.", "The Saudi foreign ministry said it \u201crejects any attempt to link Islam with terrorism, and condemns the offensive cartoons of the prophet\u201d .", "Its government also called for \u201cintellectual and cultural freedom to be a beacon of respect, tolerance and peace that rejects practices and acts which generate hatred, violence and extremism and are contrary to the values of coexistence\u201d.", "The former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad wrote on Twitter that \u201cMuslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past. But by and large the Muslims have not applied the \u2018eye for an eye\u2019 law. Muslims don\u2019t. The French shouldn\u2019t. Instead the French should teach their people to respect other people\u2019s feelings.\u201d The attitude of the French president was, he said, \u201cvery primitive\u201d.", "Gargash, an ally of the French and opponent of Turkey in Libya, said in an interview with Die Welt: \u201c[Muslims] have to listen carefully to what Macron said in his speech. He doesn\u2019t want to ghettoise Muslims in the west, and he is totally right.\u201d", "He added: \u201cAs a Muslim, I feel offended by certain caricatures. But as a thinking person, I see the politics that are carried out around this topic.
