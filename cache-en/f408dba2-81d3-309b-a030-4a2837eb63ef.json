Movers salvage furniture and kitchen supplies from buildings awaiting demolition or on the verge of collapse, their facades covered with deep cracks. A few hundred metres away, outside a shelter for those made homeless by the disaster, Meryem, a divorced teacher, and her two children are packing their belongings onto a pickup truck. Her house survived, says Meryem, but suffered so much damage that she refuses to go back. \u201cI would not wish this on anyone,\u201d she says.", "At least 116 people died in the magnitude 7.0 quake, including a woman who drowned in a minor tsunami set off by the tremors. Rescue teams poured in from all over the country. Thousands of people volunteered to give blood. Local businesses distributed food to the survivors. Nearly three days into the search effort, exhausted workers pulled a three-year-old girl from the rubble of her home. A day later, they rescued another toddler.", "Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Turkey has seen four deadly earthquakes this year alone and 18 tremors measured at 7.0 or above in the past 120 years. Almost 60m people, or 70% of the population, live in seismic zones. Yet disaster response is no longer a serious problem in Turkey. Preparedness is. Out of a total of about 10m buildings, 20-25% do not meet current standards for earthquake protection, says Mustafa Erdik, head of the Turkish Earthquake Foundation. Others put the figure even higher.", "The risk is especially acute in Istanbul, home to over 15m people. Nearly 70% of the city\u2019s housing stock dates from before 2000. Two decades ago, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake killed at least 17,000 people. Scientists agree that another big one is a matter of time. Some put the probability at up to 40% over the next 30 years. According to a recent study by the local planning agency, another earthquake of similar magnitude would destroy 48,000 buildings, damage 194,000 and cause 120bn lira ($15bn) in damages. Since Istanbul accounts for a third of Turkey\u2019s GDP , the long-term economic damage could be severe.", "Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his government have taken steps to lessen the impact of future quakes. Over 500,000 vulnerable buildings have been demolished and replaced since the launch of an \u201curban renewal\u201d programme in 2012. Under a scheme partly financed by the World Bank, the government has earthquake-proofed more than 1,200 schools and hospitals in Istanbul. A slew of recent infrastructure projects, including a new bridge over the Bosporus and an undersea tunnel, have been designed to withstand big quakes. Over 56% of Turkish homeowners have taken out earthquake insurance, one of the highest rates in the world, and up from 26% a decade ago.", "But Turkey seems to have taken a step back for every step forward. Critics say urban renewal has enriched companies close to the government, overlooked environmental concerns and triggered a wave of evictions. \u201cThis was a very good programme,\u201d says Naci Gorur, a geologist at Istanbul Technical University. \u201cBut they handed it to the developers, who prioritised those neighbourhoods where they could make the most profit.\u201d The construction frenzy that propelled Turkey\u2019s economy under Mr Erdogan has swallowed up open spaces and parks. Of the 470 assembly areas designated in Istanbul after the 1999 quake, only 77 remain, according to the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Ahead of an election two years ago, the government announced an amnesty on unlicensed construction. The scheme benefitted the owners of over 7m properties across Turkey. One of these was an apartment building in Istanbul that collapsed on its own early last year, killing 21 people. Three of its eight floors had been illegally built. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["magnitude", "turkeys", "70", "recovers", "earthquake", "braces", "damage", "world", "pieces", "picking", "buildings", "taken", "istanbul", "turkey"], "pubDate": "2020-12-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
