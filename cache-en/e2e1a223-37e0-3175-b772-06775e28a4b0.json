Many new movies have had to be viewed at home, on streaming services, and cinephiles have had to accept this arrangement, rather like gourmets who see their favourite restaurants survive by repurposing themselves as delivery and takeaway centres. And streaming has, arguably, given a new audience to independent and arthouse cinema that might not otherwise have much of a showing in theatres.", "Lockdown has intensified the debate about the validity of the small-screen experience of cinema \u2013 and it\u2019s especially intense for me, when I consider one of my favourite films of the year. Steve McQueen\u2019s Lovers Rock is one of the glorious works in McQueen\u2019s superb five-movie Small Axe sequence about the Black British experience. It is gloriously cinematic and was slated to feature at this year\u2019s (cancelled) Cannes film festival. But it was commissioned by the BBC, and so the vast majority of the people enjoying this wonderful film will be doing so on the small screen. That\u2019s why it is being described, understandably, as one the television highlights of the year.", "Well, it can be both, and so I am listing it in the Braddies, my personal choices that exist separately from Guardian film\u2019s best-of-the-year countdown.", "As ever, there are 10 nominees in 10 categories: film, director, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, documentary, cinematography, screenplay, directorial debut. There is also the single-entry nomination in the special category: quirkiest future cult classic most likely to be overlooked by the boomer mainstream media establishment.
