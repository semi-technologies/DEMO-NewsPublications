One of her clearest memories is of her parents returning every holiday bearing gifts of their own making. \u201cMy mom would bring me sketches, and my dad would create small sculptures out of clay,\u201d Reva says. \u201cI never had any plans to become an artist myself though, and I was even scared to think about it as I assumed it was something really serious because it\u2019s what my dad did.\u201d", "The creative gene ran too deep to ignore: At the age of 17, Reva moved to Kyiv to begin her studies in fashion design at the National University of Technology and Design\u2014\u201cI thought fashion design felt less serious somehow,\u201d she explains\u2014and then moved to London\u2019s Central Saint Martins to complete a masters degree. Somewhere along the way, however, she found herself pulled back to a more purely artistic path. \u201cWhen I graduated I got a job offer in fashion design, but it felt weird,\u201d Reva adds. \u201cI should have been so happy because it was my big dream, but then when it happened, I was sitting there and thinking, I'm not quite sure this is what I wanted to do.\u201d", "For the past few years, Reva has found a happy medium. Based in Kyiv, she\u2019s been working on her own fine art projects while traveling regularly for brand collaborations with the likes of Jacquemus, Rachel Comey, and Kara. But like so many around the world, with the onset of the pandemic at the beginning of the year, her plans abruptly changed. While on holiday with her boyfriend and parents in Mexico, restrictions were imposed that left them stuck there for most of the spring. With the slower pace of life imposed on her, and the significant amount of time she spent with her parents as a result, she notes that a new kind of bond was formed."], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["rural", "spent", "plans", "reva", "design", "artist", "studies", "summer", "parents", "fashion", "looks", "unexpected", "creative", "serious", "masha", "moved", "kyiv", "ukraine"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
