Following an email leak that circulated previously, Bungie's Luke Smith has confirmed that a special event is going down.", "The leaked email reads as follows:", "Be sure to catch the finale of the Season and see the conclusion before Beyond Light releases. For more information on what is coming, read the new This Week at Bungie now.\"", "The email released before it was supposed to, obviously, which is something Luke Smith addressed in a recent tweet. \"We have a small event to close out Season of Arrivals,\" he said. \"We wanted it to be a surprise but an email accidentally mentioned it! It's nothing too crazy, just a little time to chill in the Tower before the Lights go out. See you soon!\"", "Clever use of capitalization of Light vs. Dark aside, we don't actually know what the event will entail. Last season's end was a little bit of a wash. The event itself started almost an hour late and the payoff? 15, maybe 20 seconds of boom? Luckily, Smith is tempering expectations early by saying it's a small event, so we're interested to see how they end the current arc in preparation for the new season that drops alongside Beyond Light.", "What did you think of Destiny 2's Season of Arrivals?
