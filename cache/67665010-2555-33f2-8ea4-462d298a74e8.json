What makes a Friday afternoon is a trip to Uncle Mike\u2019s Bake Shoppe to pick up a kringle\u2014most likely the sea-salt-caramel-pecan version, which was voted the best kringle in North America. The Wisconsin kringle, brought over by Danish immigrants in the nineteenth century, is a pizza-size confection composed of thirty-odd layers of flaky dough, filled with fruit, nuts, or cheese, and molded into an oval ring, which is why it\u2019s called the toilet-seat pastry.", "In 2008, to mark the Presidential election, Uncle Mike\u2019s decided to start selling sugar cookies decorated with printed portraits, in icing, of the candidates\u2019 faces. Barack Obama appeared on a blue background, John McCain on a pinkish one. \u201cIt was just sort of a fun thing to do, you know, because some people get a little stressed out about the elections,\u201d Mike Vande Walle, alias Uncle Mike, said on a recent Friday at the shop, as the phone rang constantly. He was wearing a red Hawaiian shirt and a mask printed with ladybugs and bumblebees, only his eyes visible beneath white hair.", "At some point, he decided to turn the cookie sales into a poll, or, rather, two polls: a national one, based on mail orders received from around the country, and a local one, based on purchases in the shop. The cookie poll, like many such undertakings, is not science. In 2012, Uncle Mike\u2019s sold more Mitt Romney cookies, despite Obama\u2019s taking the White House. But four years ago, when Wisconsin unexpectedly broke for Donald Trump\u2014the first time since 1984 that the state had gone red in a Presidential race\u2014the cookie poll predicted the outcome, with Trump up by about four points. \u201cIt was right on the money,\u201d Vande Walle said.", "Asked about this year\u2019s results, Vande Walle pushed a piece of paper across the counter. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d he said. The local poll, according to his tabulation, stood at sixty-eight per cent Trump, thirty-two per cent Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re buying the Trump ones as jokes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I can think of, because that\u2019s a big spread.\u201d There were more Bidens than Trumps left on a tray in a display case, positioned between kringles and doughnuts.", "\u201cIt was an important election.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Ellis Rosen", "A young woman carrying a knockoff Louis Vuitton bag came into the shop with her mother and perused the display. \u201cShould I drop one of these off for Grandpa?\u201d she asked, pointing to the Trump cookies. Her mother looked horrified. A public-school teacher waiting in line to buy doughnuts had a similar reaction. \u201cSmash the pink cookie,\u201d she said.", "A little girl in pink leggings and a pink T-shirt was standing next to the cookie case with her mother and older sister. \u201cBiden,\u201d she said, pointing to the blue cookie. She made a thumbs-down sign and stuck out her tongue. Then she said, \u201cTrump! Yay!\u201d She gave a thumbs-up.", "Uncle Mike\u2019s is just outside Green Bay, in an area that is more Republican than the city proper. According to a local report, Vande Walle said, roadside signage breaks down as follows: \u201cTrump is the No. 1 sign, then signs for pumpkins, and then Biden.\u201d", "The week before Election Day, the national cookie poll also had Trump winning, sixty-five per cent to thirty-five. Vande Walle has declined to take a side. \u201cI was thinking that after the election we should do some kind of special cookie, just because 2020 is such a weird year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it might be neat to have a cookie wishing it gone.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Elisabeth Zerofsky", "Elisabeth Zerofsk"], "keywords": ["uncle", "mikes", "poll", "wisconsin", "wins", "walle", "vande", "landslide", "trump", "shop", "cookie", "election"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
