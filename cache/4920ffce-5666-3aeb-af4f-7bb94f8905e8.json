By day, Novalinga is a college student studying business management, but on TikTok, she brings her Indigenous culture (and style) to the app. Indigenous creators such as James Jones and @the_land have indeed been gaining popularity on the app, using TikTok as a space to celebrate the beauty of Indigenous regalia and traditions. Novalinga does this as well, but primarily through videos of herself throat singing with her mother, Caroline, an art form she learned from her.", "Throat singing is a style of music that is unique to Inuit people, though other tribes, such as Tuvan people, perform iterations of it as well.

(In Indigenous culture, every part of a hunted animal is used.) \u201cThe connection between my mother and I grows bigger as we throat sing together. It's always a beautiful moment for us,\u201d she says. For a modern twist\u2014this is TikTok after all\u2014she\u2019ll also put her own Indigenous twists on various viral trends on the app, adding her throat singing overtop trending songs, for instance."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["tiktok", "app", "pride", "mother", "culture", "bringing", "throat", "videos", "indigenous", "singing", "singer", "creators", "novalinga", "inuk", "cultural"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
