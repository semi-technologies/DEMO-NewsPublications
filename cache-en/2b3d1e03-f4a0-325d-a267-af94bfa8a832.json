Today, the model and certified vintage-lover posted an Instagram of herself in an all-black look that included a Michael Kors bag, Coperni jeans, and Versace boots. But here, the puffer coat was a standout: a vintage Jean Paul Gaultier piece with sleeves that went beyond the fingertips, which lent the silhouette a slice of outr\u00e9 cool. She noted in her caption that she styled herself, with makeup by Sam Visser and hair by Jennifer Yepez. Shortly, after she posted to her Instagram, she followed up with a story that read: \u201cOne of my best Depop finds is this jacket and it will forever keep me warm.\u201d Truly a \u201ccelebs, they\u2019re just like us\u201d moment.", "Photo: Courtesy of Bella Hadid/@bellahadid", "For the uninitiated, Depop is the Gen Z-beloved direct-to-consumer heaven and a trove for all things designer, including vintage and archival pieces. And it\u2019s not totally surprising that Hadid uses it. She\u2019s long worn vintage. We\u2019ve seen her dripping in archival Dior, slathered in museum-worthy Vivienne Westwood, and of course, her collection of \u00fcber-rare T-shirts. But one would think that Hadid has a team of vintage-obsessed elves seeking out the best grails for the model, and to some degree, this is probably true. But Hadid seems to enjoy scrolling for killer pieces herself, just like the rest of us.
