And Judge Andrew L. Brasher of the 11th Circuit, appointed this year, wrote an opinion this month rebuffing the campaign\u2019s effort to bypass the lower federal court and decertify Georgia\u2019s election results.", "Mr. Fischman said that to rule differently would have been to flout the law. \u201cIt\u2019s completely against judicial culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just could not be taken seriously as judges if they sided with Trump here.\u201d", "Judges Bibas and Brasher serve on courts that Mr. Trump has flipped toward conservative majorities.
