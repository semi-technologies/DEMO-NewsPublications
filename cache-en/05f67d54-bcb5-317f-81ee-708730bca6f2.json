The novel was heralded by the Spectator as \u201cexciting both in promise and achievement\u201d, while the eminent critic Gerald Gould wrote: \u201cSo original is it that I have scruples about writing the word \u2018novel\u2019 at all.\u201d", "Trevelyan, who has all but sunk into obscurity, had been the first female winner of Oxford University\u2019s Newdigate prize for poetry while a student there \u2013 a win that garnered headlines from Wisconsin to Auckland, and prompted the Daily Mail to predict that her \u201cfuture work will be watched with interest\u201d. By 1940, she had published seven more novels as GE Trevelyan, when her Notting Hill home was hit by a bomb during the London blitz. She died of her injuries in February 1941, at the age of 37; her death certificate described her as \u201cSpinster \u2013 an Authoress\u201d.", "\u201cShe\u2019s been completely forgotten. None of her books have been reprinted. They\u2019re incredibly hard to get hold of,\u201d says Scott Pack, the former Waterstones head buyer and publisher at Lightning Books, which is teaming up with Abandoned Bookshop to republish Appius and Virginia for the first time in more than 80 years.", "Pack came across the novel when he read a review by Brad Bigelow at the Neglected Books site. Bigelow, who describes himself as \u201cprobably the only person alive who\u2019s read all her books\u201d, called Appius and Virginia \u201cone of the most powerful stories about loneliness ever written\u201d; Pack, intrigued, managed to find a copy.", "\u201cI read it and I thought, \u2018This is incredible,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIf she was a bloke, she\u2019d still be in print today, without question. All of Aldous Huxley\u2019s books are still in print \u2013 some of them are amazing, some aren\u2019t that great. He was doing interesting social commentary, and also experimental stuff. She was doing the same sort of thing and no one\u2019s heard of her.\u201d", "Bigelow agrees: \u201cEvery one of her novels took great stylistic and imaginative risks. I can\u2019t think of another writer of her calibre who\u2019s been so completely forgotten.\u201d", "Gertrude Trevelyan (centre) with the other contributors to Red Rags: Essays of Hate from Oxford, a book of anti-communist essays, photographed for the Bystander in 1933. Photograph: Provided by Eye & Lightning", "The novel opens as Virginia, a 40-year-old single woman, contemplates the orangutan Appius \u2013 a \u201ctiny dark splash in the whiteness of the cot\u201d \u2013 and begins to train him. The idea had come to her some time back that \u201cif a young ape were taken at birth and brought up completely in human surroundings, exactly like a child, it would grow up like a child \u2013 would, in fact, become a child; except for its appearance, of course, and even there something might be done\u201d.", "As the years pass, Virginia starts to believe that Appius is learning to understand her, to speak, even read: \u201cIf it succeeded she would indeed have achieved something. She would have created a human being out of purely animal material, have forced evolution to cover in a few years stages which unaided it would have taken aeons to pass \u2026\u201d But if her experiment fails, she fears that \u201cher existence would no longer be justified in her own sight. The newly awakened need of her being to create would be frustrated utterly. She would go back to Earl\u2019s Court and her bed-sitting-room \u2013 gas fire and griller, separate meters; to her consumption of novels from the lending library; her bus rides to the confectioner\u2019s; her nightly sipping of conversation and coffee in the lounge: to middle-age in a ladies\u2019 residential club. Each year a little older, a little stouter, or a little thinner, a little less quickly off the bus.\u201d", "Trevelyan shows how different Appius\u2019s experience of the experiment is; and as Virginia\u2019s need for him grows \u2013 \u201cDarling child, you can\u2019t know how lonely mama was before she had you\u201d \u2013 the chasm between their two perceptions of the world widens inexorably.", "While the Spectator and Gould loved the novel, others acknowledged its challenging nature. \u201cIt must have required considerable courage to conceive Appius and Virginia and to carry out the conception so carefully \u2026 Miss GE Trevelyan demands equal courage from her readers,\u201d said the Times Literary Supplement. Others were less convinced: it was \u201csaved from being disgusting only by its frantic silliness\u201d, according to the Mail. For Pack in 2020: \u201cIt is dark and grim, but that\u2019s why I like it.\u201d", "A descendant of Sir Charles Trevelyan, founder of the modern civil service, the author was educated at Princess Helena College, Ealing, where she won the school essay prize two years in a row. She began at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, in 1923, winning her Newdigate prize with a 250-line work titled Julia, Daughter of Claudius \u2013 something she told the press she wrote as a joke. As she would later write, she maintained \u201ca position of total obscurity\u201d at Oxford, because she \u201cdid not: play hockey, act, row, take part in debates, political or literary, contribute to the Isis or attend cocoa parties, herein failing to conform to the social standards commonly required of women students.\u201d", "After Oxford, Trevelyan\u2019s father\u2019s modest fortune gave her \u00a3500 a year, and a room at 107 Lansdowne Road in Notting Hill, where for nine years, from 1931, she would focus on nothing but writing. After Appius and Virginia, her books included As It Was in the Beginning, a stream-of-consciousness work told from the perspective of a woman dying in a nursing home; and her final work, Trance By Appointment, about a psychic who is exploited for commercial gain. Abandoned Bookshop\u2019s reissue of Appius and Virginia is the first time any of her work has been reissued since her death in 1941.", "\u201cShe had a small circle of friends, avoided the limelight, reviewed no books, neither taught nor edited, made no trips abroad or otherwise diverted her time and energy from the task of writing,\u201d writes Bigelow in his introduction to the reissue. \u201cThis allowed her to take great risks in style, structure and approach, to create works of imaginative intensity unequalled by any novelist of her time aside from Woolf herself.\u201d", "Her death was marked with a news story in the Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette, which noted how she \u201chad the misfortune to be buried beneath the wreckage of a London flat\u201d the previous year, and \u201cnever fully recovered\u201d. Appius and Virginia, the story noted, was \u201ca first novel of really outstanding importance\u201d.", "If she had not died, says Bigelow: \u201cTrevelyan might well have continued to write groundbreaking fiction and become recognised as one of the leading novelists of her generation.\u201d", "\u201cShe is a fascinating and important writer who has been unjustly forgotten by history,\u201d says Pack. \u201cIt is time that her novels were back on bookshelves.\u201d"], "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "keywords": ["trevelyan", "print", "shed", "bloke", "virginia", "child", "work", "read", "oxford", "novels", "appius", "pack", "gertrude", "lost", "books", "novel"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
