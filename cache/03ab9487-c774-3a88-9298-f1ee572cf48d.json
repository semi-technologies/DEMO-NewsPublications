It was Election Night, and Joe Biden was scheduled to speak in a parking lot behind the Chase Center. Attendance inside the lot was invitation-only, and people were expected to stay in their cars. They\u2019d been lining up for hours, presumably keeping warm.", "Outside the parking-lot fence and next to a mini-mall, about thirty journalists and a ragtag group of citizens were gathered, shivering, huddled over smartphones, watching the results come in and not come in. Von Michael Todd, a math professor at Delaware Tech, was wearing a mask bearing Pac-Man\u2019s workplace, the blue labyrinth. \u201cThis is my city!\u201d he said. \u201cWhen do we ever have a Presidency in our city? Where you can see Biden come out here?\u201d Not that he hadn\u2019t seen Biden in person before. He had\u2014at the train station one day. And he knew where Biden got his groceries: Janssen\u2019s.", "\u201cAll celebrations aside,\u201d Todd said, \u201cwe need someone with a plan.\u201d He enumerated the plans that were needed: a plan for the virus, a plan for police to peacefully interact with African-\u00adAmerican men like himself, and a plan for education in the Covid era. \u201cI\u2019m a plan person,\u201d he said.", "The hours passed with no results. Outside the fence, people came and went, but, aside from the journalists, there were never more than thirty people waiting to celebrate the President-\u00adelect in his home town. It did not feel like a party.", "Crystal Adkins, a social worker, and her daughter Makayla, twenty, had not left their car. In the driver\u2019s seat, Crystal was making her way through some pasta from Target. Makayla was on her phone. At least sixty million people had voted for Trump, and this had rattled them both.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the world right now,\u201d Crystal said. \u201cIt means that everything that happened in the last four years\u2014hurting \u00adpeople, the children being taken away from their parents, the derogatory statements that he\u2019s made about women and families and people\u2014it all meant nothing. I mean, who are we? Who are we now, to want another four years of this?\u201d", "Makayla had been in high school, just outside of Wilmington, in 2016. \u201cThe day after Trump was elected,\u201d she said, \u201csome students, and even one teacher, came to school wearing MAGA stuff. And I was, like, \u2018I thought we were friends, but I guess we\u2019re not friends.\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cAnd it brings me here tonight,\u201d Crystal said, \u201cbecause I just want to be as close as I can to Biden, because we need him. We just need him.\u201d", "An hour passed with no clarity, and Crystal and Makayla went home. The journalists packed up; nothing would be decided that night. The next day was balmy and bright, and the election was trending Biden\u2019s way. Another small crowd of locals amassed at the fence, under the flag, with word that Biden would make an announcement soon. It was not expected to be an acceptance speech, but even a glimpse was enough for Bob and Tricia Beichner, who were sitting on a curb. Bob\u2019s mouth was hidden behind a Grateful Dead mask, but his white Polo sweater and dad jeans hinted at fiscal conservatism.", "\u201cI\u2019ve actually been a lifelong Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day that I left the Republican Party was the day after the nomination process in 2016.\u201d Bob had lived in New York when Trump was a tabloid fixture; he couldn\u2019t believe he was being taken seriously as a candidate. \u201cI went to the Delaware Department of Elections and I changed my party affiliation.\u201d Since the 2016 election, Bob and Tricia have been baffled about the national psyche and about the friends they thought they knew. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a single soul who voted for him,\u201d Tricia said. \u201cAll my Facebook friends, from high school, college, not a peep.\u201d Slowly, though, she realized that a startling number of them were Trump supporters. \u201cAnd I\u2019m struggling. I\u2019m really struggling now with friendships.\u201d", "There was a commotion near the Chase Center, and everyone turned to see a caravan of police S.U.V.s, Secret Service vehicles, an ambulance, and what looked like a modified Brink\u2019s truck speed by. \u201cThere he is!\u201d Bob said, and waved to one of the cars. \u201cI saw him!\u201d Afterward, in the small\u2014perhaps envious?\u2014audience by the fence, there was some doubt about whether Bob had actually seen Biden.", "With the clocks having just been set back, afternoon turned to night somewhere around noon. The results were still murky, and the crowd, such as it was, dwindled to nothing. The only people left were three Secret Service agents sitting in a white tent, looking at their phones. Then, just after nine, in the darkness and under the vast \ufb02ag, an Indian-American group of six\u2014two friends, with their wives and kids, all from Wilmington\u2014arrived. They took pictures of the \ufb02ag, of each other, and of the empty parking lot where Biden may or may not eventually declare himself the winner.", "Approached by a reporter, they nominated the second-youngest of the group, seventeen-year-old Risha Kumar, to be their spokesperson. (The Trump supporter in the family, Risha\u2019s father, was demure.) \u201cWe\u2019re just excited to take photos near here, because it\u2019s kind of a historic event, right?\u201d Risha said, her eyes bright, searching for each next word. \u201cHonestly, there\u2019s not really been any big politician in history from Delaware, so it\u2019s just cool to have someone who\u2019s from the local political scene on the national stage.\u201d Being so young, Risha\u2019s overlooking Biden\u2019s forty-four years in Washington, D.C., could be forgiven. It turned out that she knew her history.", "\u201cI honestly think that the No. 1 issue is how much Americans trust their government. I think that a lot of Americans trust the democratic system, but do we really trust the people who are in power? And I think that without trusting the people who are in power at least a little bit, we can\u2019t even compromise, and we\u2019ve become so saddened by the situation. And I think that this has been a pattern. It\u2019s kind of just been going down in our government since Nixon.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Dave Eggers", "Dave Egger"], "keywords": ["think", "delaware", "joe", "need", "voters", "day", "trump", "await", "crystal", "friends", "fence", "biden", "lot", "bob", "plan"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
