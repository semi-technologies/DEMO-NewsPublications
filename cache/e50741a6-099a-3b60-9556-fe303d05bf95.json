She worked as legal counsel at a national nonprofit then, and told no one at the office that she was expecting. Normally thin, she hid her changing figure under baggy clothes and, once she began to show, a tight girdle. She begged her obstetrician to squeeze her in for appointments early in the morning or during her lunch breaks.", "Get the Parenting Newsletter Email Sign Up", "When, by the end of her second trimester, it became clear that she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her pregnancy a secret much longer, my mom went into her boss\u2019s office and gave notice.
