Their predecessors, he told them, gave it its name: perpetuana. Woven from the wool of hardy sheep from the west of England, perpetuana was so called because of its almost endless durability.", "Mr Gardner, a retired fashion retailer, is Master of Exeter\u2019s Incorporation of Weavers, Fullers and Shearmen, one of the last craft guilds outside London. With just weeks before Brexit and the loss of preferential trading terms between Britain and the European Union, Mr Gardner and a party of his members were in Florence to commemorate a pan-European trade in cloth that helped lay the foundations of Western civilisation.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Starting in the 15th century, galleys from Florence, having delivered embroidered cloth to Sluis on the Dutch coast, would dock at Southampton and Dartmouth to take on bales of wool and perpetuana. The cloth was further processed and embellished in Florence before re-embarcation for sale across Europe. The Florentines with whom the English traded had their own professional association, the Arte di Calimala, which was subsumed in the 18th century into the Camera di Commercio. Last week\u2019s modest ceremony, one of several events to mark the 400th anniversary of the Exeter Incorporation\u2019s royal charter, was held at the Camera\u2019s headquarters.", "All sides benefited handsomely from the triangular wool trade. By the 18th century, Exeter was one of Britain\u2019s richest cities. Among the many by-products of the trade was Barings Bank, brought down by a rogue trader only in 1995. In Florence the cloth trade helped enrich the Medici family and finance the Italian Renaissance, creating a link between the sample of beige cloth unfurled last week and the masterpieces hanging in the Uffizi gallery a few hundred metres away.", "The Incorporation\u2019s activities today are largely ceremonial and charitable. Its members no longer have to be in the textiles business. Like other Britons, said its unofficial historian, Simon Whewell, they divide more or less evenly on Brexit. But Remainers seemed to be in the majority among those visiting Florence. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible mistake,\u201d said Roger Persey, a farmer, as he stood with a glass of Italian wine at an open-air reception atop the Camera\u2019s headquarters.", "Mr Whewell called it \u201cjust bizarre\u201d. But, taking the long view, he was moderately sanguine. \u201cOver the centuries, we\u2019ve been through plagues and wars yet trade has always found a way around barriers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like water flowing downhill.\u201d\u25a0"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/10/03/british-and-italian-guilds-mark-a-centuries-old-european-trade", "title": "British and Italian guilds mark a centuries-old European trade", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["perpetuana", "british", "european", "wool", "cloth", "gardner", "weeks", "centuriesold", "century", "whewell", "trade", "guilds", "florence", "mark", "italian"]}
