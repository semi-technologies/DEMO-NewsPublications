A writer always concerned with understated craftsmanship and the quiet thrust of the unexpected, he has recently published an accomplished new collection, In the Event. Here, he covers a range of themes beyond the aesthetic, but this week\u2019s poem illustrates how subtly he handles the latter.", "The family-memory genre readers might have initially anticipated is unpeeled in a single sentence, which, from the phrase at the end of the main clause opening stanza two (\u201cgrownups tend to select\u201d) to the poem\u2019s penultimate line, is cast in the present tense. This indicates an interest in general principles beyond the specific occasion of the \u201cBest\u201d stone competition. Note the ironic capitalisation of the \u201cB\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a good clue to the speaker\u2019s tones. On the Pebbly Beach is decidedly not a nostalgic poem, despite the final stanza\u2019s observation \u201cand now that I sleep diagonally / and walk alone on this beach\u201d. In the context, this \u201cupdate\u201d reads almost as an aside. It simply makes space for the final weighing-up of principles.", "From the start of the narrative, when \u201cthe children took off over the stones like little dogs\u201d and \u201cwe followed in our different conversation\u201d, a distinction is registered between the two generations. But the phrasing (\u201cour different conversation\u201d) also points to a similarity, of course: the adults\u2019 conversation differs from that of the children, but the children\u2019s response, perhaps less verbal, is still connective, still involves a form of conversation.", "It would be easy, perhaps, for the narrator to overdo the distinction between the favoured stones, but Birtwhistle steers description coolly away from exaggeration and stereotype. It isn\u2019t the sea that has formed the sculpturally perfect ovoids and ovals, but \u201cher centuries of energy\u201d. That striking abstraction has a visual charge: it delivers the image of vast, relentlessly moving waves.", "The children\u2019s stones are cartoon-like and asymmetrical \u2013 almost, in the colloquial sense of the term, gothic. They have a contemporary style, in comparison with the adults\u2019 choice. They are interactive. Fingers can be poked into their \u201cfunny holes\u201d, and the resemblance to the children themselves, who earlier ran about like \u201clittle dogs\u201d is intensified by the comparison to \u201cpuppies\u201d. These favourite stones are anthropomorphic. We can assume they have been shaped randomly, by micro-organisms, as well as damage from the elements. No artist-sea has smoothed and buffed them.", "The significant question the poem broaches at last concerns \u201cwhose preference is the most mature\u201d. This would add an ethical dimension to the poem\u2019s investigation, if we were being invited to consider maturity a desirable quality. The poem in its wisdom doesn\u2019t explore the value of maturity. It may suggest that properly rational and adult judgment would ensure that the different aesthetic principles symbolised by the choice of stones deserve culturally to be equally represented.", "Another poem in In the Event, On a Certain Poet, uses the analogy of a \u201csilky cat\u201d that \u201cin a single elegant phrase / draws out the syntax of its motion so as to leave / clear each object on the mantelpiece it slinks // along and between so as to cause no catastrophe / to obstacles acutely observed and yet un- / touched, leaving things pretty much as they are\u201d. As in On a Pebble Beach, the aesthetic judgment is finally withheld: it\u2019s up to the reader to decide if the technique of \u201ca certain poet\u201d is admirable or otherwise. It\u2019s a different question, but of the kind Birtwhistle discusses with lucid aplomb. His work is consistently both shaped and calm, and energised by the various tides it travels."], "authors": ["Carol Rumens"], "keywords": ["birtwhistle", "children", "stones", "conversation", "different", "aesthetic", "poet", "little", "john", "beach", "pebbly", "poem", "week"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
