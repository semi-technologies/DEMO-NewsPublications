Also, don't go reading about the show beforehand, how it works, how it was made. All you need to know is it's animated (by freaks) and that there's something of a disconnect between words and images. It might bother you, at first. What am I looking at? What should I be concentrating on? Then you\u2019ll embrace it and experience the very state\u2014post-narrative, dreamlike\u2014that the show is thematically/structurally/literally all about. Confused? Just accept it. Meditate. Be at peace. Eventually, it\u2019ll make perfectly imperfect sense. \u2014Jason Kehe", "Sorry You Couldn\u2019t Make It, Swamp Dogg", "Swamp Dogg, the 77-year-old soul and R&B legend, put out a country album this year\u2014working with Jenny Lewis, John Prine, and Justin Vernon\u2014because Swamp Dogg can do whatever the hell he wants. It\u2019s warm, elegiac, and funky; opener \u201cSleeping Without You Is a Dragg\u201d and closer \u201cPlease Let Me Go Round Again,\u201d a duet with John Prine, will break your heart. (It\u2019s Prine\u2019s last recorded song released before he died of Covid this year.) It sounds exactly how 2020 has felt: like a reminder to hold the ones you love while they\u2019re here. \u2014Kate Knibbs", "P-Valley", "TV\u2019s sleeper hit of 2020 was a sensual southern noir that put the lives and concerns of sex workers, and women in particular, front and center. Even for a show about strippers struggling to make ends meet in the Mississippi Delta, P-Valley is about more than the eroticism it sells. The show\u2019s real draw was its choice to not diminish its Blackness, its southerness, its raunchiness, and its womanness. To say nothing of its lush cinematography or the sumptuous script penned by creator Katori Hall (the show was inspired by an old play of hers, Pussy Valley), it\u2019s a riot of pleasure in ways expected, surprising, and necessary. Anchored by actors Brandee Evans, as veteran dancer Mercedes, and Nicco Annan, who shined as the quick-tongued gender-fluid club owner Uncle Clifford, P-Valley is what the cultural historian Mark Anthony Neal calls a \u201ccritical intervention\u201d\u2014which is to say it\u2019s a story that insists on a more imaginative contour of Black identity. It doesn\u2019t play small. It knows what it is. We\u2019re lucky to have it. \u2014Jason Parham", "Small Axe: Lovers Rock", "Throughout the end of 2020, British director Steve McQueen (12 Years a Slave) released a series of five films on Amazon called Small Axe. The anthology, which told the stories of West Indians living in London from the late-1960s to the mid-\u201980s, was rich, but the one that\u2019s stuck with me the most so far is Lovers Rock. It\u2019s not the most hard-hitting\u2014other installments deal with police brutality and the 1981 Brixton Uprising\u2014but it\u2019s the one that feels the most lived in. It has a scant 70-minute runtime, but nearly all of those minutes are spent lingering at a single party, experiencing the drama, exhilaration, and burgeoning romance of its celebrants. McQueen films it in such a lush, inviting way, it\u2019s impossible not to feel swept up and engrossed. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "Hades", "This year was one of reckoning, forcing me to recalculate every aspect of what I thought I knew. I thought I disliked most indie video games, that I needed low stakes, that looting would always be preferable to dying. Hades made me realize just how wrong I was. You\u2019ll flit through the Greek underworld in an attempt to escape\u2014hundreds if not thousands of times, each more satisfying than the last. Hades is about incremental progress, perseverance, certitude, and hope. It\u2019s an especially fitting game for 2020 (and it helps that the soundtrack, art, and voice acting are incredible). I dedicated 1,200 words to it in this review, but you\u2019ll see what I mean within the first 10 minutes of gameplay on PC or Nintendo Switch. \u2014Louryn Strampe", "Reaganland, Rick Perlstein", "The word of the year might have been \u201cunprecedented.\u201d We live in \u201cunprecedented\u201d times, et cetera\u2014and yes, 2020 was a particularly trying stretch of time for the United States. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to make sense of some recent events, but I found historian and journalist Rick Perlstein\u2019s most recent book, Reaganland: America\u2019s Right Turn 1976-1980 an invaluable source of context for understanding why things are the way they are. I\u2019ve been a Perlstein fan for a while now; he manages to blend political history and cultural history in an organic and digestible way. If it was up to me every high schooler in America would have Perlstein\u2019s series on American culture since the 1960s (he also wrote 2008\u2019s equally indispensable Nixonland) as a backbone of their US history curriculum. The unprecedented usually has some precedent if you look hard enough. \u2014Kate Knibbs", "Woke", "2020 hurt so much it\u2019s almost funny, and so does Hulu\u2019s bizarre social justice comedy Woke. The show stars New Girl\u2019s Lamorne Davis as Keef Knight, a cartoonist who suffers a surreal nervous breakdown after experiencing police brutality. He talks to googly eyed markers, trash cans, bottles of malt liquor, and nightmarishly whitewashed versions of his own face; he sees racism everywhere. His friends diagnose him: \u201cMan, you woke.\u201d Which all sounds very virtuous and highbrow in a snoozy sort of way, but trust me, it\u2019s too strange to be sanctimonious. One episode revolves around the hunt for an escaped koala rumored to understand sign language. Knight screams \u201cI am the sausage!\u201d at polite conference-goers. Davis is effortlessly funny playing straight man to a world gone mad, and watching him slowly come undone is only more poignant for the show\u2019s unabashed wackiness. Of all the shows I watched this year, its tone resonated most with the soup between my ears. \u2014Emma Grey Ellis", "\u201cI Know the End,\u201d Phoebe Bridgers", "Truly all of Phoebe Bridgers\u2019 second full-length, Punisher, is worth your time, but the album\u2019s finale\u2014rightfully the track titled \u201cI Know the End\u201d\u2014is the reason to stick around until the finish. Simultaneously about the end of relationships and the end of the world, it starts with whisper-sung lyrics about feeling lost and looking for home, and ends in a cacophony of shredding guitars, horns, and guttural screams. Catharsis in audible form. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "Bubba, Kaytranada", "Though technically released in December 2019, Kaytranada\u2019s thump-resonant, dance floor radiant, synth-rich flurry of color and beats was the perfect reservoir of music to escape into this year. The DNA of the record is all about people coming together\u201413 of the 17 tracks have features; from the R&B singer Tinashe to cultural polyglot Pharrell\u2014and works as a kind of metaphor: In a year that forced us to seek new ways to live and collaborate, Bubba is the ultimate collaborative effort. Dark times don\u2019t last forever, but while they do, it\u2019s best to take a note from Kaytranada and dance the darkness away. \u2014Jason Parham", "Euphoria", "Earlier this year, Zendaya made history, becoming the youngest woman ever to win an Emmy for best actress in a drama series. It could easily be the most deserved award of the whole year. Her portrayal of Rue on HBO\u2019s Euphoria is heartbreaking in its rawness. As Rue, she plays a teenager who is struggling with both crippling drug addiction and being in love with her best friend, Jules (Hunter Schafer). It\u2019s the kind of role that could easily be taken too far. Every actor who wants to Go There and give a \u201creal\u201d performance attempts to portray the life of an addict. Yet, at no point in Euphoria does anything Zendaya does feel performed. It\u2019s just lived. Nowhere is this more true than in Euphoria\u2019s special one-off episode earlier this month. The show was supposed to begin filming its second season at the beginning of 2020, but got shut down due to Covid. To fill the void, show creator Sam Levinson wrote a bottle episode that begins with Rue\u2019s dream of what her life with Jules could\u2019ve been and then pivots to nearly an hour of conversation between Rue and Ali, a friend she met in NA, at a near-empty diner on Christmas Eve. They talk sobriety, spirituality, grief; ultimately, as Rue ponders her own end, Ali asks her how she\u2019d like her sister and mother to remember her. The answer, given after nearly 30 seconds of silent trembling, is \u201cas someone who tried really hard to be someone I couldn\u2019t.\u201d In a show that often gets by on style and movement, it's the most quietly wrenching minute of TV aired this year. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "Marnie", "In a year that left so many of us adrift in our spiritual seas, the arrival of Marnie has felt like a lifeboat. Marnie\u2014a character created by actor Brian Jordan Alvarez\u2014may look and sound like a counterfeit Marianne Williamson, but she is so much more than her bug eyes and blunt bangs. She is joy personified, pure source energy. When one of Marnie\u2019s videos appears in your lifeless Twitter feed, you stop your scroll and listen to her dreamlike soliloquy, because Marnie contains infinite wisdom. Her credentials include a doctorate in astrology and a master\u2019s in clinical spirituality. She invented drugs, and the idea of \u201cthe sexual breakfast buffet.\u201d She has existed for longer than money, or light. How long can the joke go on? Seemingly forever, now that Alvarez has turned Marnie into a regular feature on Cameo. While you have spent the year relegated to your couch and your computer, Marnie has traveled various planes of consciousness, and to spiritual retreats in Turkey, Napa, and the Bahamas, to bring back an important message. And her message is this: You, the viewer, are god consciousness, you are love, you are the essence of the essence, and everything in this surrealist world will be OK so long as you sign up for Marnie\u2019s class. \u2014 Arielle Pardes", "His Dark Materials, Season 2", "The best thing about season 1 was Ruth Wilson\u2019s Mrs. Coulter. She\u2019s still the best thing about season 2\u2014but the rest of the show, miraculously, has almost caught up to her. Gone are the pacing problems and the depressing non-focus on daemons. Now, the world feels real. Worlds plural, rather, since Lyra and her new friend Will must travel between them to realize their destinies. She has a truth-teller. He has a knife. Together, they can cut through the lies of religion! Or something. Let\u2019s hope the show doesn\u2019t back away from Philip Pullman\u2019s greater blasphemies, speaking of. It doesn\u2019t seem to be\u2014Dr. Mary Malone is here, talking to angels on her supercomputer, learning of their vengeful ways. She\u2019s played by Simone Kirby, in a performance so convincing it\u2019s like they plucked her from a real physics lab. Watch out, Wilson\u2014there\u2019s a new woman in town, and she\u2019s got science on her side. \u2014Jason Kehe", "Nobody Will Tell You This But Me, Bess Kalb", "Full disclosure: I\u2019m biased. Bess Kalb and I used to work together in WIRED\u2019s research department long before she became a writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! I\u2019d like to think, though, that I would still love her book\u2014an autobiography about three generations of women: Kalb, her mother, and grandmother\u2014just as much. Funny, heart-wrenching, and written with a gentle flourish many attemp but few master, it\u2019s a delight. It\u2019s also a quick read that can be tackled on a weekend, or over a holiday break. Finish it in a few days and then call your mom. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "How To With John Wilson", "The unique, funny, tender HBO docuseries How To With John Wilson was just renewed for a second season, and it may take years to come together. Wilson has a laborious and not particularly efficient method of collecting footage for his episodes; he walks around New York with his camera and sees what he can see, and then cobbles together a narrative based on what he finds. I\u2019ll wait a decade for another round. I reviewed the series for WIRED last month, and wholeheartedly meant it when I called it \u201cthe year\u2019s best nature documentary.\u201d It\u2019s a feat of observation and mischief, and I promise you haven\u2019t seen anything like it before. \u2014Kate Knibbs", "Bright and Dangerous Objects, Annaliese Mackintosh", "Solvig is a commercial deep sea diver who spends weeks working on the bottom of the ocean. She\u2019s also trying to have a baby with her tender-hearted tattoo artist boyfriend, James. She\u2019s also a finalist in a contest to become one of the first humans to colonize Mars, although James doesn\u2019t know that yet. It\u2019s a one-way trip. Bright and Dangerous Objects follows Solvig as she chases several incompatible dreams simultaneously, questioning what it means to be a mother and whether her impulses to explore the far-flung corners of the ocean and universe are something she should curtail or embrace. While most people would turn down a suicide mission to the Red Planet, Solvig\u2019s struggle\u2014how to make her dreams fit inside her life?\u2014is a universal one, and this is a beautiful book. \u2014Kate Knibbs", "Birds of Prey", "In any other year, Birds of Prey might have been the cherry on top of a sundae of superhero delights. As far as comic-book movies go, it\u2019s definitely the quirkier\u2014but also smarter\u2014kid sibling to more serious-minded DC films like Justice League or Suicide Squad, and would\u2019ve easily fit in as the beloved oddball of the bunch. But as it turned out, director Cathy Yan\u2019s movie about the exploits of Harley Quinn ended up being one of the few movies to hit theaters, period, in 2020. Good thing it was a good time. Bright, action-filled, and perfect in its imperfections, it\u2019s a delightful popcorn flick. And Margot Robbie\u2019s embodiment of the film\u2019s main antiheroine just gets better with each new movie where she plays her. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "Dave, Episode 5", "Of the many things I thought we didn\u2019t need this year, one of them was definitely a show about an aspiring white rapper trying to break into the music business in LA. Yet the awkward charm of Dave\u2014created by and starring Dave Burd, aka rapper Lil Dicky as a version of himself\u2014will eventually win you over, as it did me. Past the plethora of excessive dick jokes and its sometimes thorny treatment of fame, what the show did better than almost all of the TV shows I watched this year was write with empathy about mental health, and particularly what that means if you\u2019re Black and have bipolar disorder. If there\u2019s one episode of Dave to watch, it\u2019s this one. It will change you. \u2014Jason Parham", "Luster, Raven Leilani", "Earlier this year, I wrote that Raven Leilani\u2019s debut was \u201ca story about race, class, and everything else that eviscerates people\u2019s ability to live and connect. Luster is bled through with an honesty about the subterfuge of survival that is both gripping and often hilarious.\u201d I fully stand by every word of that. It\u2019s been three months since I put it down and haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it since. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "Devs", "If you watch a lot of TV, Devs will feel wrong to you. Very wrong. It\u2019s paced lugubriously. It\u2019s highly visual. And like the science fiction of old\u2014a genre of ideas\u2014it\u2019s actually about something. Something big. Something like destiny, as understood by godlike technology. The star of the show is a pulsing, bright-gold quantum computer. It sits right there in the center, influencing everything, and around it squirm and dance the engineers, churchgoers of a near future. No other show captures Bay Area tech worship quite the same. Or the Bay Area itself, riven with self-contradiction. (You\u2019d think creator Alex Garland, a Brit, was a lifelong resident.) There\u2019s also a Russian subplot, in case you were thinking this all sounds a bit heady and heavy. By the end, story and subject merge in a spectacular way. Maybe it\u2019s one thing. Maybe it\u2019s another. Observation is all. \u2014Jason Kehe", "Mrs. America", "All historical fiction, but especially historical fiction about conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly and the rise of second-wave feminism, should feature Cate Blanchett, Sarah Paulson, and Rose Byrne. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "Teenager Therapy", "Gael, Mark, Kayla, Issac, and Thomas are five teenagers from Anaheim, California. They make a podcast about teen life. Subjects include: high school crushes, depression, the presidential election, LGBTQ issues, racism, their favorite TV shows, what it\u2019s like to lose a loved one, friendship, acne and skincare routines, abortion, Instagram, prioritizing happiness, the Black Lives Matter movement, eating disorders, navigating social media, heartbreak, body image, cancel culture, funny YouTube videos, struggling with self-worth, and basically anything that has to do with being human. From time to time, the show will bring on guests, like TikTok influencer Shalom or a specialist from The Trevor Project, but mostly it\u2019s five friends sitting around talking about life. In other words, Teenager Therapy is a podcast about feelings and knowing that you\u2019re not alone in the world. \u2014Jason Parham", "Unorthodox", "Taking its cues from Deborah Feldman\u2019s autobiography Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots, this Netflix miniseries is an often heartbreaking, often liberating look at one woman\u2019s struggle to escape her life, and marriage, in the ultra-Orthodox community of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. At times nerve-wracking, and often unexpectedly funny, Unorthodox is full of rich characters, but its true treasure is the breakout performance of Shira Haas as the show\u2019s young heroine. She\u2019s transfixing. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "The Future of Work", "A lot happens to human consciousness in our new collection of sci-fi short stories\u2014it\u2019s uploaded to servers (\u201cRemembrance\u201d), studied by machines (\u201cCollaborative Configurations of Minds\u201d), and beamed across the universe (\u201cBeyond These Stars Other Tribulations of Love,\u201d \u201cars longa\u201d). This was accidental; we didn\u2019t tell these authors what to write about. Just gave them a prompt\u2014what\u2019s the future of work? Of course, science fiction reflects the present, and the world right now is in a state of hyperconsciousness. We\u2019re all very aware of ourselves, our situations, our livelihoods, and we\u2019re trying to survive as best we can. That\u2019s the other thing that comes through in these illuminating stories\u2014the desperation for human connection. In the end, the collection suggests, we\u2019ll do anything to stay together. \u2014Jason Kehe", "Monsterland", "I hate horror as a genre. I don\u2019t require recreational fear. Real life is scary enough. But I loved Hulu\u2019s horror anthology series Monsterland because, despite all the supernatural creatures, the real monster is real life. Specifically, American life. Each episode follows a drab, ordinary person in an American city during their gravest moment: losing a child, being unable to afford life saving medication, being the cause of a disastrous oil spill, learning that her husband is a sexual predator. Each time some supernatural creature appears to give form to their desperation, and it nearly always destroys them. The show makes no overt statements about social issues, but every character is driven into the arms of monsters by some grinding social ill, whether it's classism or climate change. It\u2019s grotesque and it\u2019s beautiful. In other words, it\u2019s America. \u2014Emma Grey Ellis", "Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt\u2019s Reunion on the Fast Times at Ridgemont High Live Table Read", "I don\u2019t remember exactly when it happened, but big name celebrities hopping on Zoom to do live table readings of old movie and TV scripts became kind of a thing this year. Mostly it was a way for well-meaning Hollywood types to raise some money for charity and fill the hours they couldn\u2019t work. Mostly these efforts were what folks would call A Perfectly Nice Time. But when everyone got together to read Fast Times at Ridgemont High to benefit Sean Penn\u2019s Covid-19 relief efforts, it turned into Broken Up Couple Goals. As the table read started and each actor logged on, Brad Pitt spotted his former flame Jennifer Aniston and cooley said, \u201cHi, Aniston.\u201d She replied with a similarly cool, \u2018Hi, Pitt.\u201d And when he inquired, \u201cHow you doin\u2019?\u201d she responded with a completely unbothered, \u201cGood honey, how are you doin\u2019?\u201d It was the biggest, \u201cShould I text my ex?\u201d moment of 2020. (The answer to that question, though, is \u201cno.\u201d You should not text your ex; it is impossible to be as chill as these people when doing so.) Watch the whole thing at 0:19 below. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "Locally Grown TV", "Everything felt like TV this year. The last 12 months were an endless torrent of Zoom meetings, FaceTime calls, TikTok comedy, Verzuz Instagram battles, Netflix binges, chats with family members via Facebook portal, White House news conferences, Twitch streams, and strange YouTube conspiracy theory videos. We live on our phones and through our screens. We\u2019re endlessly watching and being watched. More than that, though, we\u2019re becoming TV\u2014an infinite form of entertainment for one another to consume, share, and bicker over. One corner of the internet where traditional TV was reformatted in a radically cool new mode was Locally Grown, a streaming website with the luster of public access programming. With about a dozen user-curated channels, surfing through its slate of programming is like stumbling across lost treasure, from hard-to-find Soul Train episodes to discussions between academics and artists. One recent night this past February, just before midnight on a channel titled Black Art, Black Cinema, Black Excellence, I watched the French documentary Universal Techno; following in the next hour were clips from 1998\u2019s Freaknik, the iconic spring break festival. The range of programming on Locally Grown is as robust, visionary, and exhaustive as Black culture itself. \u2014Jason Parham", "Dunking on Nevada During the Election Vote Count", "2020 was nothing if not a year in which almost everyone with internet access was Very Online. Largely this led to even more bickering, flame wars, and depressing scenes than before, but in the high-tension days before news outlets called the 2020 US presidential election for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, folks did manage to have some fun at the expense of Nevada. For days after November 4, as other states finished their vote counts, the tally coming out of the Battle Born State moved at a sloth\u2019s pace. The resulting jokes broke the tension at a time when America needed it most. \u2014Angela Watercutter", "Cate Blanchett and Sarah Paulson Live on Instagram", "Just hit play, here. Do it now. Yes, that\u2019s Cate Blanchett, in close-up, saying \u201cvirgin.\u201d And there\u2019s Sarah Paulson, smelling her pits and doing a Southern accent. Ostensibly they\u2019re promoting Mrs. America, their Hulu show, but legendary actors eschew the expected. Their 40 minutes together devolves\u2014evolves\u2014into high art, a real-time redefining of the genre of the celebrity Zoom. They sink, they swim, they soar. This is what the medium promised us, but what no other actors have been able to achieve. When it\u2019s over, your face will hurt, and you will know the power of pure performance. \u2014Jason Kehe", "More Great WIRED Stories"], "authors": ["Wired Staff", "Wired Staf"], "keywords": ["angela", "thing", "best", "real", "end", "2020", "pop", "tv", "way", "live", "culture", "jason", "life"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
