She served as an ambassador for Amazon Studios\u2019s bipartisan voting information campaign, raised awareness for Stacey Abrams\u2019s voter suppression documentary, All In: The Fight For Democracy, and starred in Hulu\u2019s Taste the Nation, a show that broadcast the diverse cuisines and therefore population of America.", "But come Election Day, when all that can be done has been done, she\u2019ll be seeking comfort in a way so many of us can relate to: through food.", "Food, perhaps more so than anything in this vast, complicated country, is a unifying entity. It brings people together (there\u2019s a reason idioms like \u201cbreaking bread\u201d are synonymous with common ground), and out of their cultural comfort zones. (As Lakshmi told the New York Times in August: \u201cFood can be a great instrument, and that is how I try to use it.\u201d)", "Today, food\u2019s instrument will be used to nourish and assuage anxiety during a time when, for most Americans, uncertainty is at an all-time high.", "So what is Lakshmi cooking? That would be her Oven Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Balsamic Onion Jam. \u201cI love this dish because it\u2019s incredibly comforting and feels like an indulgence, but is actually very healthy, \u201d she tells Vogue. \u201cSweet potatoes are high in fiber and have a lower glycemic index than regular potatoes. The flavor profiles are sweet, tangy and spicy\u2014which I love. This dish has the feel of a restaurant appetizer, while being easy enough to quickly whip up at home.\u201d", "Below, her sweet-potato recipe\u2014the perfect dish for a cold and unpredictable November night.", "Photo: Courtesy of Padma Lakshmi", "Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Balsamic Onion Jam", "Serves 4"], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["used", "onion", "potatoes", "lakshmi", "cooking", "instrument", "padma", "comfort", "love", "night", "sweet", "dish", "election"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
