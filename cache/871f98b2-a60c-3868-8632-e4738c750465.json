The worm can survive in the water up to 48 hours, entering a person\u2019s body through the skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "WHY A WOMAN'S BRAIN STARTED LEAKING AFTER PILATES", "That easy method of transmission led to one 43-year-old man getting infected by the parasite, reports a 2016 case study published in The New England Journal of Medicine.", "But the parasite wasn\u2019t the worst of his experience. When the man started suffering from painful bathroom trips and blood in his urine, doctors realized he had a major bladder issue, per the case study.", "Imaging revealed the bladder completely encased in calcium along with some calcification of the ureter and bowel, reports the NEJM case. In addition, doctors saw calcium around the seminal vesicles, which store most of the fluid that makes up semen.", "\u201cThis pattern of calcification is typical of chronic genitourinary and gastrointestinal schistosomiasis, in which the larvae of the schistosoma parasite are deposited on the walls of the organs and become calcified,\u201d Doctors Pankaj Nepal and Devendra Kumarthe wrote in the case study.", "MAN'S 20-FOOT TAPEWORM LINKED TO THIS EATING HABIT", "In other words, doctors often see calcification around the genital organs or digestive tract with this infection. That\u2019s because the parasite\u2019s eggs penetrate the skin and lodge themselves in organs, where they get surrounded by calcium over time.", "However, Dr. Ronald Blanton told Live Science that the extent of this man\u2019s calcification suggests the parasite may have lived decades inside the man.
