The Twitter account posted a meme depicting Hillary Clinton, splayed out on the ground, saying \u201cHelp! I\u2019ve lost and I can\u2019t shut up!\u201d Then the account shared another Clinton meme, showing the cover of her book What Happened alongside a phony cover featuring President Donald Trump and the words I Happened. Soon after, @Team_Trump45 turned abruptly personal, posting about their \u201cdaughter\u201d Nicky. \u201cWell her temperature is going up fast 102-104,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cWe gotta go to the hospital.\u201d", "Then the account\u2014which would later change its handle to @DeepStateExpose\u2014returned to tweeting about Trump. It posted three memes in three minutes: one showing a map of the US, all red, and the words \u201cKeep it up Libs. This will be 2020\u201d; an illustration of Trump pulling a barge carrying items meant to represent various industries; and an image of Trump alongside money signs and arrows, meant to symbolize the economy. Several hours later, it tweeted a fourth meme, about the \u201cTrump Train.\u201d", "Those four posts attracted the attention of Trump, who retweeted them to his 38 million followers. This was the same day that the president posted a tweet referring to Kim Jong Un as \u201cRocket Man\u201d and a GIF depicting Trump hitting Clinton with a golf ball. The day of controversial tweets earned the president headlines. The New York Times referred to @Team_Trump45 as one of the president\u2019s \u201cfans.\u201d @Team_Trump45 must have been elated, though not surprised; it wasn\u2019t the first time Trump had retweeted the account, but it made the nonstop posting about the president worth it. Millions would see @Team_Trump45\u2019s tweets, and they would even live on in the presidential record. The question was: What did the account want with all the exposure?", "Sign Up Today Sign up for our Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.", "At the time, @Team_Trump45 had 161,000 followers and went by the display name \u201cTrumpism 5.0 \u2122.\u201d (The trademark wasn\u2019t real, and the display name changed often.) The user\u2019s profile said, \u201cTrumpism epitomizes Conservatism, Capitalism, patriotism, & respect for the Constitution. #MAGA.\u201d The account posted constantly, almost always pro-Trump tweets, but the rest were about Nicky. In May 2017, the account first shared the link to a GoFundMe campaign to \u201chelp Nicky fight her battle with cancer.\u201d The campaign had been created that month, and the goal was set at $100,000. @Team_Trump45 referred to having a \u201cdaughter with cancer\u201d and posted descriptions of what it said were the girl\u2019s tumors. It continued sharing the GoFundMe link into September, around the time of those Trump retweets.", "Pictures of Nicky that @Team_Trump45 posted showed a young girl with big blue eyes. She was smiling but appeared to be lying in bed, dressed in a hospital gown. Nicky apparently made a painting, which @Team_Trump45 posted, of a woman in a blue gown with a cape billowing behind her that looked like a starry sky. The woman had reddish hair, like Nicky\u2019s before she lost it. Nicky called the painting \u201cNight.\u201d", "On the day after Trump\u2019s retweets, @Team_Trump45 posted another update: \u201cNicky is still fighting, blood transfusions, platelet transfusion, high fever, she turned blue but she\u2019s still fighting somehow. Thank you.\u201d Over the next few months, the account gained 13,000 followers. Donations poured in, reaching over $30,000. But some people were getting suspicious about whether the campaign was legit.", "Of course, Trump is famous for retweeting dubious accounts. One account Trump thanked in a tweet, @10_gop, which claimed to be a Tennessee-based source of \u201cconservative, daily news that you won\u2019t find on mainstream media,\u201d later appeared on a list of accounts operated by the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-backed troll farm. Another account Trump once retweeted, @Blacks4Trump16, had identified its operator as \u201ca black woman\u201d but later started regularly retweeting the account @Identitarian14, which described itself as \u201cpro-white.\u201d Twitter has suspended at least a dozen accounts Trump retweeted or quoted, and at least 16 more have since been deactivated, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Media Matters for America."], "authors": ["Max Kutner", "Max Kutne"], "keywords": ["hazards", "woman", "president", "later", "team_trump45", "posted", "online", "nicky", "retweeted", "trump", "sleuthing", "account", "day"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
