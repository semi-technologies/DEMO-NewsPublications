That's just not going to happen. We're not going to allow that to happen. We're inspired. We're inspired as a party. We're inspired as a state that we are going to see the balance of power delivered in the United States Senate and therefore in the United States government. And it will be delivered by two Republican Senators from the state of Georgia.\"", "\"I think the greater danger is if the President not challenged the results because he has a responsibility that I feel like he is fulfilling in challenging the results. It was a razor thin margin. Whether you're Republican, Democrat or Independent, everyone wants fair, transparent and honest elections. We all have to have that. So I applaud the President for what he's doing. But here is concern that we are losing our focus and not focusing on what we need to be focusing on, and that is these two senatorial races that are coming up on January 5th.\""], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["republican", "run", "buddy", "president", "carter", "road", "georgia", "results", "senate", "races", "united", "state", "going", "rep", "socialism", "inspired", "states"], "pubDate": "2020-12-01T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
