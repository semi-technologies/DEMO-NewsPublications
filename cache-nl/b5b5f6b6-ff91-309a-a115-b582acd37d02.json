In the longer term, it wants to add tram and bus stops and quaysides to the list.", "No fines", "Eventually, the idea is that every location in the city where smoking is not welcome will have a tile designating it as a smoke-free zone. But this is not the same as a ban, and smokers won\u2019t be fined if they light up. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that people will talk to one another and smoke-free will become the new normal,\u201d says Kukenheim, who presented as part of a policy programme entitled \u201cTogether towards a smoke-free Amsterdam\u201d.", "The programme\u2019s purpose is threefold: to dissuade youngsters from taking up smoking, to encourage Amsterdammers to give up, and to create a smoke- and tobacco-free environment. \u201cA lot has happened already, but it\u2019s time for the next step,\u201d Kukenheim says. She points out says the city could impose bans in specific places, for example under planning regulations, but that\u2019s not the idea at this stage. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we want to get into. There are lots of things you could potentially enforce in Amsterdam, but the question is what you want to achieve.\u201d", "Kukenheim says experience has shown that it works better if local people help the area to stay smoke free. \u201cWe could tell people not to smoke at the entrance to a particular school, but if you don\u2019t have buy-in within the school, the parents haven\u2019t been informed and the concierge isn\u2019t aware, there\u2019s no point.\u201d", "The intention is that organisations themselves talk to visitors, students, and patients. If that doesn\u2019t work, Kukenheim says, the city will not hesitate to impose bans.", "Smoke-free city", "She says the package of measures forming part of the new policy programme is the next step towards a smoke-free Amsterdam. The city wants to ensure that no young people or pregnant women are smoking in 2030, and that fewer than five percent of Amsterdammers indulge in the habit by 2040. The current figure is 27 percent, but there are big differences between districts. In Zuidoost it\u2019s 23 percent, while in Nieuw-West it\u2019s 33 percent. The national average is 23 percent.", "People with low to medium levels of education are more likely to smoke, and the city plans to make an extra effort to help them stop. Ashtrays will be removed from all parent and child welfare offices in the city, and \u201cSmoke-Free Generation\u201d signs displayed.
