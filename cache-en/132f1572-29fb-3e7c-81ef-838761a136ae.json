Altered Carbon and Westworld were hits, there\u2019s a new Matrix movie in the works, and Cyberpunk 2077 is poised to be the year\u2019s most successful, and most hyped, video game. For Mike Pondsmith, one of the genre\u2019s founding fathers, it all makes perfect sense. In the world of cyberpunk, technology has the ability to create miracles, people are struggling for power, the future is uncertain, and corporations have the power of gods.", "Sound familiar? \u201cWe have a more cyberpunk world than ever before,\u201d Pondsmith says. \u201cThings have fallen apart. The upshot is that we have greater levels of uncertainty and more things are in play.\u201d", "Pondsmith doesn\u2019t remember the first time he heard the word cyberpunk. Back in the mid-1980s, when Pondsmith was working on the tabletop RPG that would inspire Cyberpunk 2077, he was just trying to rip off Blade Runner and leave the replicants behind.", "\u201cI think the aesthetic of Blade Runner made the genre,\u201d Pondsmith says. \u201cA large part of the cyberpunk genre is atmospherics. It\u2019s the feel. Blade Runner is important not just because of the technology but because it had the elements of film noir that cyberpunk is always calling back to.\u201d", "For Pondsmith, the genre feels so vital right now in part because that feeling and aesthetic map closely to our own. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and frequently drives into Torrance to visit family. It\u2019s a city of large refineries belching fire into the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s Blade Runner, but the cars don\u2019t fly,\u201d he says.", "Pondsmith has been many things in his nearly 40-year career\u2014a graphic designer on early video games like Ultima, a designer for The Matrix Online, and creator of the pen and paper roleplaying game Cyberpunk Red, the basis for Cyberpunk 2077.", "Developer CD Projekt\u2019s new video game is set in the world Pondsmith and his team at publisher Talsorian Games created in the 1980s. Cyberpunk, as Pondsmith said, is an aesthetic and thematic label that encompasses the written works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, movies like Blade Runner, and video games like Deus Ex. In a cyberpunk world, high tech meets low life, and power belongs to those who can cobble together the code and the credits to seize it.", "\u201cThe world you expected to be the future didn\u2019t happen. We were supposed to get The Jetsons and instead we\u2019re not sure if we\u2019re gonna get fed.\" Mike Pondsmith, game designer and author of Cyberpunk (1988)", "\u201cCyberpunk, when you get down to it, is what would happen if the world we\u2019re living in now were positioned 10 or 20 years down the line,\u201d Pondsmith says. \u201cThe story is about a society that is like ours just enough that we can seriously relate to it, but at the same time has all this technology that has gotten to a certain level of alienness. What is our relationship to all this stuff? How does it affect us? How does it change how we\u2019re getting along?\u201d", "Cyberpunk was a huge genre in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. Books like Neuromancer and Snow Crash told stories of a future that was rooted in the present. \u201cYou were dealing with a lot of economic uncertainty with Reaganomics, social change,\u201d Pondsmith says. \u201cThe world you expected to be the future didn\u2019t happen. We were supposed to get The Jetsons and instead we\u2019re not sure if we\u2019re gonna get fed. There was a lot of uncertainty and fear, but at the same time there were these marvels.\u201d", "In the mid-1980s, Pondsmith says that an engineer friend redesigned a $300 scanner to do the work of a $42,000 machine they had to rent from an office downtown. It changed the way he did business. \u201cTechnology had begun to move out of a scientist or technician class and was getting down to the level where a guy like that could say, \u2018I don\u2019t like this scanner, I think I\u2019ll redesign it.\u2019 It had moved to the street,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think those two things come together, you have uncertainty but you have marvels. Your immediate thought is, \u2018Whenever we\u2019ve had something marvelous, usually the people in power get it first. They don\u2019t let us have it. They stand against us.\u2019\u201d", "The villains of cyberpunk stories are usually corporations; its heroes are usually street kids, hackers, and anyone else clever enough to find a loophole in the system. \u201cWe have a very cyberpunk universe. A megacorporation in the 1980s was a big, slow, monolithic thing. Think GE. But corporations today are ubiquitous, they are fast, they are mobile, they are worldwide,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can at least vote for a politician. You don\u2019t get a vote when a corporation creates something new. You get to use it, but you\u2019re not really sure that they\u2019re not using you.\u201d"], "authors": ["Matthew Gault", "Matthew Gaul"], "keywords": ["isnt", "father", "surprised", "founding", "cyberpunk", "pondsmith", "world", "video", "things", "genre", "uncertainty", "think", "comeback", "blade", "runner"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
