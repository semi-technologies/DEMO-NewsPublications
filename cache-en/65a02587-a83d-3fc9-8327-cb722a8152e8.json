They were anti-radio, I\u2019d tell anyone willing to listen to my little rant on the subject. Better not to be seen. Better to be a voice. A presence. Hearing Howard Stern has a power that seeing him does not. Ditto Rush Limbaugh or Terry Gross or anyone who knows what they\u2019re doing on the mic. Why give up invisibility, which makes radio so powerful?", "But of course, we live in a world dominated by images. If you want newspapers or magazines to tell readers that your new radio show exists, most of them insist on some sort of photo. And a couple of years into this, my sisters Randi and Karen intervened and told me to drop the schtick and just have my picture taken like everyone else. But till then, our show\u2019s publicity photo had me hidden behind a handwritten note saying \u201cRadio = No Pictures.\u201d", "You learn and change over 25 years of doing a thing.", "In 1995, when we went on the air, there were a handful of people on NPR experimenting with the sort of journalism-as-radio-storytelling I liked, but nobody had done a weekly show of it. \u201cThis American Life\u201d gave this kind of audio narrative journalism \u2014 stories told with plot and characters, and a chatty, informal sound \u2014 a visibility it had never had.", "As part of our new partnership with The New York Times, I\u2019m pleased to note our 25th year here, by sharing some of my favorite episodes. We tried this at Thanksgiving \u2014 with a list of holiday listening recommendations \u2014 and people seemed to like it, so we\u2019re doing it again.
