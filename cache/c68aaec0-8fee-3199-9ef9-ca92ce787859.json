Its colours\u2014black, red and yellow\u2014represent Australia\u2019s first people, their connection to the land and the life-giving sun. It is hoisted over schools and waved at sporting fixtures. It flies periodically over Sydney\u2019s famous Harbour Bridge. Yet Aboriginals fear its very existence is under threat.", "The issue is copyright. Australia\u2019s government has officially adopted the flag, but its design is still owned by the man who created it, Harold Thomas, an Aboriginal artist. He conceived it in the 1970s as a banner for the campaign to allow Aboriginals to reclaim their traditional lands. The image was reproduced fairly freely until 2018, when he sold exclusive rights to its use on apparel and \u201cdigital and physical media products\u201d to WAM Clothing, a private firm.", "WAM has since chased down many firms and charities for royalties. The Victorian Aboriginal Health Service was told it would have to pay to use the flag on T -shirts, a recent Senate inquiry heard. These were sold at cost to patients to encourage them to attend check-ups. Diabetes Victoria, another non-profit, had to stop using the flag on its website because WAM demanded payment.", "\u201cHow could one company have a monopoly on an iconic symbol?\u201d wonders Laura Thompson, an indigenous health expert. She started a campaign to \u201cfree the flag\u201d after her charitable enterprise was given three days to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from printing it on clothing. To some, it seems doubly insulting that the firm commercialising the banner is owned by white Australians. Worse, critics argue, its co-founder, Ben Wooster, has a record of exploiting indigenous culture. Another of his companies, Birubi Art, was fined A$2.3m ($1.65m) last year for selling fake Aboriginal art.", "The danger, says Linda Burney, the country\u2019s first female indigenous MP , is that the emblem could be forced out of use. It is already disappearing from sport. The Australian Football League ( AFL ), of top Aussie-rules teams, normally prints the flag on pitches and players\u2019 jerseys for an annual \u201cindigenous round\u201d, which celebrates its Aboriginal athletes. It stopped doing so this year after WAM threatened legal action. Australia\u2019s national cricket and rugby union teams and the National Rugby League have all followed, saying they will not pay.", "The national government is trying to defuse the row by buying the rights from Mr Thomas, WAM Clothing and two other licensees. This should allow the flag to be used freely. But not everyone likes the idea of handing custodianship of the image to bureaucrats. The Senate inquiry recommended that an independent Aboriginal committee should be in charge of it. Labor, the main opposition party, fears that things are moving rather too slowly. \u201cThe importance and history of the flag is being lost,\u201d two of its senators have warned. If negotiations are not resolved by January, they suggested, the government should forcibly commandeer the design. \u25a0", "Correction (October 22nd 2020): This article originally stated that Australia\u2019s first indigenous MP was Linda Burney. In fact, it was Ken Wyatt; Ms Burney is the second.
