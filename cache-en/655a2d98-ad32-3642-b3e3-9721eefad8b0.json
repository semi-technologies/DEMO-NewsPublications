In the movie\u2019s climactic scene, Hitler rants in his bunker while generals and adjutants look on in horror. In the parodies, alternate subtitles were inserted, to absurd effect. Amy Davidson Sorkin surveyed the genre in a 2010 New Yorker piece, and the meme is still going strong a decade later. Recent contributions include \u201cHitler Reacts to the iPhone 12 Pro,\u201d \u201cHitler Reacts to the NVIDIA GeForce,\u201d \u201cHitler Reacts to Being in Quarantine,\u201d and, in recent days, a series of videos in which Hitler reacts to the 2020 Presidential election, spouting Trumpian lines. In one, the F\u00fchrer screams, \u201cCount all the votes? How dare they to do this to me. Of course I can\u2019t win if they count all the votes.\u201d When a secretary in the corridor outside comforts her distressed colleague, she says, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Jared. Dictators still love him.\u201d", "Comparisons between Trump and Hitler ring false on many levels, as I argued at the end of a 2018 article about recent biographies of the dictator. Although the soon-to-be-ex-President has done staggering damage to American institutions, he has failed to bring about the kind of wholesale destruction of democratic process that Hitler accomplished in a few weeks in 1933, not to mention the immeasurable horrors that followed. Nevertheless, the occasion of Trump\u2019s defeat permits a certain amount of historical license. It might be argued that, although Hitler at the height of his power was a phenomenon without parallel in modern history, what he became\u2014the cornered man in the bunker\u2014was a psychologically commonplace creature. The spectacle of a power-hungry narcissist receiving his comeuppance is irresistible, and it has played out innumerable times in history and fiction.", "Hirschbiegel\u2019s film is based on a 2002 book by Joachim Fest, and both works have the same title in German: \u201cDer Untergang.\u201d That word has long been commonplace in literature about Hitler\u2019s final days. The second volume of Volker Ullrich\u2019s biography of Hitler, which has just been translated into English, is subtitled \u201cDie Jahre des Untergangs, 1939\u20131945.\u201d The usual translation is \u201cdownfall,\u201d although the various implications of the word\u2014literally, \u201cgoing-under\u201d\u2014are difficult to capture in English. In some contexts, Untergang simply means descent: a sunset is a Sonnenuntergang. But it carries connotations of decline, dissolution, or destruction. Oswald Spengler\u2019s famous book about the decline of the West is titled \u201cDer Untergang des Abendlandes.\u201d Richard Wagner\u2019s anti-Semitic essay \u201cJewishness in Music\u201d ends with the word Untergang\u2014the composer\u2019s dream of a day when Jews will disappear from the earth, whether through assimilation or through some other means. Untergang can also be a state of transition or of spiritual transformation. In Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cThus Spoke Zarathustra,\u201d the title character undertakes an Untergang, a going-under into the worldly realm.", "2020 in Review New Yorker writers reflect on the year\u2019s highs and lows.", "In the context of Hitler, the scene of Untergang gives comforting moral closure to a story of limitless horror. No matter how high the dictator might have risen, the fable suggests, he was destined to fall in the end. History supplies no such neat ending in the case of other genocidal dictators, such as Stalin and Mao, both of whom died of natural causes. The endless fixation on Hitler\u2019s last days therefore offers a too-easy narrative gratification: the devil is dispatched to hell, as in \u201cDon Giovanni.\u201d Moreover, the replaying of Hitler\u2019s Untergang compensates for the fetishistic fascination with Nazi iconography that is present all through contemporary culture. The publishing industry continues to exploit Hitler\u2019s design aesthetic\u2014Gothic type, black-white-red color scenes, swastikas\u2014to sell books. (Knopf\u2019s edition of the Ullrich biography, expertly translated by Jefferson Chase, departs from the pattern, going for hazard yellow.)", "It is widely assumed that Hirschbiegel gives a reasonably faithful idea of what life in the bunker was like. Indeed, the art direction for \u201cDownfall\u201d was meticulously researched, and Bruno Ganz\u2019s performance as Hitler may be the most eerily believable portrayal of the dictator on film: spittle-spewing rants are balanced against superficially courtly gestures and a show of soldierly devotion to the task at hand. But the scene that spawned a thousand YouTube parodies\u2014one in which the dictator screams at his military leaders, denounces the entire German nation as a pack of cowards, and announces that he will commit suicide rather than flee Berlin\u2014is based, in part, on problematic sources.", "The occasion was a three-hour briefing that took place in the map room at the bunker on the afternoon of April 22nd, eight days before Hitler\u2019s suicide. The Red Army had reached the outskirts of Berlin, and Hitler was clinging to the idea that a mostly fictional combat group under the command of the S.S. general Felix Steiner could push the Russians back. When Hitler was told that no counterattack had taken place, he apparently exploded in rage, firing accusations in every direction and announcing that the war was lost. Hugh Trevor-Roper, in his 1947 book, \u201cThe Last Days of Hitler,\u201d wove together various first-hand testimonies, making clear that they contradict one another to some degree. Ian Kershaw, in the second volume of his near-definitive Hitler biography, is similarly cautious, employing an even wider range of sources.", "Fest\u2019s \u201cDer Untergang\u201d\u2014translated as \u201cInside Hitler\u2019s Bunker\u201d\u2014draws on material that began emerging from Soviet archives in the nineteen-nineties, and that eventually received international publication in a curious document known as \u201cThe Hitler Book.\u201d Researchers for the Soviet secret police prepared this narrative of Hitler\u2019s collapse in the late nineteen-forties, interweaving the testimony of two Hitler adjutants, Otto G\u00fcnsche and Heinz Linge, who had been captured by the Red Army and interrogated at length. Much of what they recalled can be corroborated, but some of the quotations attributed to Hitler smack of a nineteenth-century novel: \u201cThe war is lost! But, gentlemen, if you believe that I will leave Berlin, you are sorely mistaken! I\u2019d rather put a bullet through my head.\u201d Fittingly, that dialogue went straight into Hirschbiegel\u2019s film, along with a theatrical detail about Hitler throwing colored pencils across a map.", "The most curious thing about \u201cThe Hitler Book\u201d is that it was intended for a single reader: Joseph Stalin. The Soviet leader had ordered the N.K.V.D. to gather as much information as it could about Hitler\u2019s last days, partly in order to make sure that the F\u00fchrer was actually dead, although Stalin was generally fascinated by his most powerful and ruthless rival. \u201cThe Hitler Book\u201d allowed Stalin to enjoy his own private staging of the Untergang\u2014a lavishly detailed chronicle of Hitler\u2019s psychological implosion, under the pressure of the invincible Red Army.", "Other accounts convey a more complex picture of that April 22nd meeting. Gerhard Herrgesell, a stenographer, told American interrogators that Hitler was \u201cgenerally composed,\u201d even if his face became flushed and he paced about. In Herrgesell\u2019s telling, it was the generals, especially Wilhelm Keitel and Alfred Jodl, who grew most heated, as they declared themselves \u201cviolently opposed\u201d to Hitler\u2019s plan to perish in Berlin, preferring that he go elsewhere and continue the fight. \u201cKeitel spoke to him in really sharp terms,\u201d Herrgesell recalled. These efforts at persuasion had some effect. Another military officer, Bernd von Loringhoven, reported that by the end of the day Hitler had overcome a condition of \u201ctemporary weakness\u201d and committed himself again to the defense of Berlin.", "The sequence of events that emerges from Kershaw\u2019s meticulous reconstruction\u2014elaborated in his book \u201cThe End: The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler\u2019s Germany, 1944\u20131945\u201d\u2014is, in a way, even more unsettling than that of an all-powerful dictator plunging into dejection as his followers watch aghast. Here, the faltering dictator is propped up and reinvigorated by his underlings. A crucial component of Kershaw\u2019s portrait of Nazi Germany is his concept of \u201cworking toward the F\u00fchrer,\u201d which describes how members of the Nazi hierarchy vied with each other to realize Hitler\u2019s vision, even in the absence of detailed orders. At the end, \u201cworking toward the F\u00fchrer\u201d involved manhandling the F\u00fchrer himself back into his mythic role. One can hardly ask for a clearer demonstration of how cults of personality feed as much upon the aspirations of their members as upon the ambitions of their leaders.", "Ullrich, in the newly translated second volume of his Hitler biography, includes the debatable \u201cbullet in the head\u201d quotation but otherwise does justice to the tensions of the scene. Although Kershaw\u2019s two volumes are probably destined to remain the definitive work on Hitler, Ullrich delivers a persuasive, all-too-timely portrait of a man whose undeniable political charisma was inseparable from his instinct for domination and destruction. The final paragraph contains a dark assessment of Hitler\u2019s legacy: \u201cIf his life and career teaches us anything, it is how quickly democracy can be prised from its hinges when political institutions fail and civilizing forces in society are too weak to combat the lure of authoritarianism.\u201d", "Clear-eyed American readers may conclude that all those swastika-emblazoned, Gothic-type, black-white-and-red books have taught us exactly nothing about the fragility of democracy. Indeed, the pervasiveness of the Sonderweg school of storytelling\u2014the idea that Germany was somehow genetically predisposed to follow a \u201cspecial path\u201d toward Nazism, dictatorship, and genocide\u2014may have blinded us to our own anti-democratic drift. In 1935, Sinclair Lewis imagined a form of American Fascism in his novel \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here.\u201d Crucial to the delusion that it can\u2019t happen here is the conviction that it could only have happened there. Now German historians are ending their books on Nazism with thinly veiled references to an American Untergang.", "2020 in Review"], "authors": ["Alex Ross", "Alex Ros", "Elisabeth Zerofsk"], "keywords": ["bunker", "book", "stalin", "hitlers", "dictator", "f\u00fchrer", "hitler", "end", "revisiting", "final", "untergang", "american", "days"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
