All I do is yell at them till they go away.\u201d", "Andrew Gulli, who is publishing the story for the first time on Thursday in the Strand magazine, said it showed \u201cwhy Jackson\u2019s works have been re-evaluated and have been so popular these past few years\u201d. Jackson died in 1965 at the age of 48, leaving behind novels including We Have Always Lived in the Castle and short stories including The Lottery. The Haunting of Hill House is described by Stephen King as one of \u201conly two great novels of the supernatural in the last 100 years\u201d, with Jackson\u2019s writing heralded today by authors from Neil Gaiman to Joyce Carol Oates.", "\u201cGreat novel\u201d \u2026 the recent TV adaptation of The Haunting of Hill House Photograph: Steve Dietl/Netflix/Allstar", "\u201cShe had the unique talent to say so much with so little and could create a microcosm of the problems of society, and personal responsibility in a very humble setting, be it a small town, a convenience store, the den of a suburban home,\u201d Gulli said. \u201cDuring this challenging time, we need this message from Jackson about shared humanity and how heroes who fight prejudice and ignorance can make a difference.\u201d", "The story drips with tension from the first sentence onward, and ends with a beginning", "Jackson\u2019s son, Laurence Hyman, said he found the story \u201camong many others haphazardly stuffed into 52 cartons at the Library of Congress\u201d. All of Jackson\u2019s papers were donated to the library by her husband Stanley a few years after her death.", "Hyman believes the unpublished piece was written in 1944. \u201cMy mother at that point was developing her \u2018noirish\u2019 voice, and was writing many short stories that were by then being published in magazines like the New Yorker and the New Republic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt obviously takes place in New York during the war years because there is reference \u2013 though crossed out by Shirley \u2013 to ration books. The story is interesting; it drips with tension from the first sentence onward, and ends with a beginning.\u201d", "Hyman said that when his mother died in 1965, she was \u201cat the top of her game\u201d, but over the next 30 years her popularity faded \u2013 she was out of print in the UK until 2009. Hyman took over running her estate in the 1990s and returned her books to shelves, with the remake of The Haunting (\u201ca rather poor movie\u201d) helping to kickstart her reputation in 1999. More recently, Netflix has been streaming its own adaptation of The Haunting of Hill House, and Hyman and his sister have assembled two collections of Jackson\u2019s stories and articles, Just an Ordinary Day and Let Me Tell You, with a book of her collected letters out next summer.", "\u2018I think my mother would be pleased with all the attention to her work\u2019 \u2026 Elisabeth Moss in Shirley.

She would most likely view all this with wry amusement. She would have no shortage of toss-off gags to contribute.\u201d", "Hyman said his mother \u201cnever liked personal publicity or having her picture taken, but she certainly did like having her work read, and, better yet, understood. She would be shocked to realise how hauntingly relevant her work is today. The \u2018possibility of evil\u2019 she saw, even on a sunny spring day, is indeed still with us, more than ever.\u201d"], "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "keywords": ["unseen", "work", "hyman", "jacksons", "shirley", "today", "hill", "mother", "jackson", "haunting", "house", "think", "published"], "pubDate": "2020-12-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
