From introducing autosave to getting rid of the Exp. Share item in favor of an automatic solution, Sword and Shield change several things about the standard play of a Pok\u00e9mon game. While Game Freak was open about a lot of the behind-the-scenes information surrounding the development of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, the team was a bit cagier about a new battle mechanic it could only tease.", "\"Traditionally in the series, you start with your starter Pok\u00e9mon and then you catch a lot of Pok\u00e9mon in the beginning, and those are with you throughout your whole adventure, and the player gets attached to them. But a lot of times, they get into the competitive battles and they find they can\u2019t actually use those Pok\u00e9mon or they\u2019re not competitive, so they have to go out and find the exact right Pok\u00e9mon or breed them in a certain way to make sure they\u2019re viable in competitive battle,\" planning director Kazumasa Iwao says. \"This time around, we really wanted to introduce some systems that help the player be able to take those Pok\u00e9mon they caught in the beginning, and the first one they chose, and actually take them straight into competitive battle. There\u2019s a lot of hidden parameters to Pok\u00e9mon that aren\u2019t surfaced to the player. We're doing a lot of stuff in the back end introducing systems that allow players to make sure that Pok\u00e9mon they want to use in competitive battles are viable.\"", "When I ask Iwao for more details, he says he can't explain the system further, but he does go on to tease it a bit more. \"I\u2019ve got to be very vague about it, but one example \u2013 it will be visible to the player and they\u2019ll know when they see it, I think \u2013 say you have a Pok\u00e9mon where it\u2019s got all the right stats and everything, but there\u2019s a personality parameter as well that comes into play in battles, and it might not be the right personality, so you\u2019ll breed until you get the right one, is what people do currently. But you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s a system in the game that will fix that for people.\"", "While it's no longer necessary to do so, Iwao says players can still put effort into breeding to come up with the perfect specimen for competitive play. \"We do think there\u2019s value in that effort that players put into it,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I think with Sword and Shield we wanted to also have a system that makes it a little bit more accessible. For example, if you\u2019re bringing a Pok\u00e9mon over from a previous game into these games, being able to use that specific Pok\u00e9mon that has sentimental value to you in the battle system competitively is something we wanted to try this time.\"", "For more on Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, head to our hub by clicking the banner below."]}
