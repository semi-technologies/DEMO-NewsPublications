Two men were also arrested in the Swiss city of Winterthur, near Zurich, after reports Fejzulai had met them in Switzerland.", "Fejzulai is also believed to have travelled to neighbouring Slovakia in July accompanied by another man, where he attempted to buy ammunition suited to the weapons he used in the attack, but the sale reportedly fell through after he failed to produce a firearms licence.", "Kujtim Fejzulai", "Slovakian authorities are said to have informed their Austrian counterparts at the time. The men travelled in a car registered in the name of the mother of an Islamist known to police.", "Austria\u2019s interior minister, Karl Nehammer, said on Tuesday that Fejzulai was known to the authorities as a sympathiser of Isis. He had been sentenced to 22 months in an Austrian prison on 25 April 2019 for affiliation to a terror organisation, after attempting to cross from the Turkish border \u2013 where he had met two Germans and a Belgian \u2013 into Syria.", "The sentence was suspended in December last year on condition he would be regularly monitored by probation services and would participate in a deradicalisation programme.", "Nehammer and the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, both of the conservative People\u2019s party, have criticised his premature release from jail. Nehammer said Fejzulai had been able to deceive his mentors in such a way that they registered no early warning signs of his radicalisation. He said it pointed to \u201ca faultline in our system\u201d, which had allowed for \u201ca premature release of a radicalised person\u201d.", "Alma Zadi\u0107, the justice minister, of the Green party, defended the decision, saying it was legal and that he had been released on parole. The justice ministry later said it had not been informed about Fejzulai\u2019s attempts to buy ammunition in Slovakia, saying it would have been reason to arrest him.", "The government was meeting on Wednesday to discuss the security situation and whether the attack might have been prevented.", "Reinhold Einwallner, of the Social Democratic party, said he was astounded that the attacker\u2019s attempt to buy ammunition, particularly when his affiliation with Isis was known, had not triggered a security alert. \u201cIt should have caused alarm bells to ring,\u201d he told the Austrian newspaper Kurier.", "A red rose placed in a bullet hole in a restaurant wall at the site of the terrorist attack in Vienna.

And if that was the case, why was this terrorist not taken off the streets?\u201d Herbert Kickl of the party said.", "Nikolaus Rast, a lawyer who acted for Fejzulai, said his client had drifted through life and was \u201ceasy prey\u201d for terror groups. \u201cHe left the impression on me of being a young man searching for something, who didn\u2019t know what his place in society was, who had failed to find an appropriate apprenticeship position and was therefore easy prey for certain groups,\u201d he told the tabloid Bild.", "Three men, two of Turkish origin and another who is Palestinian, were being hailed as heroes for having risked their lives at the scene of the attack to help some of the injured.", "Mikail \u00d6zen, 25, and Recep Tayyip G\u00fcltekin, 21, were about to park their car on Schwedenplatz ahead of enjoying a last coffee together before a coronavirus lockdown when the shooting started. They ran to the aid of a woman they saw lying on the ground, and G\u00fcltekin was shot at.", "\u201cThe attacker fired at him. But Recep was able to intuitively save himself by doing a forward roll,\u201d \u00d6zen said. They managed to take the woman to safety.", "Osma Yoda, 23, who had been working in a McDonald\u2019s on the square, was helping his boss carry boxes when they came across the gunman. \u201cHe was hidden in a closed garage entrance and was shooting at passersby,\u201d the Palestinian man said. When two police arrived, the gunman shot at them, striking one of them. \u201cI dragged him behind a concrete bench and tried to stop the bleeding,\u201d Yoda told Kurier. \u201cHe continued to fire from a distance of around 20 to 30 metres. There was blood everywhere.\u201d", "He then helped officers take him to a nearby ambulance, assisted by G\u00fcltekin and \u00d6zen, who are both amateur martial artists. The men were received by both the Turkish ambassador in Austria and the mayor of Vienna, who thanked them for their actions.", "A police officer on duty on the night of the attack described the confusion and chaos as he and colleagues attempted to secure the bars and restaurants in the area. \u201cThe bullets kept coming and we were rescuing injured people, but we didn\u2019t know where to take them, because we didn\u2019t know where the arsehole was,\u201d he told the Austrian news agency APA.", "The 27 people injured, who sustained both gunshot and stabbing wounds, were said to no longer be in critical condition.
