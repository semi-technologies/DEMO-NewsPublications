But it was Albert Einstein who wrote them, and he is officially revered. The quotation appears on bookmarks at the gift shop of the World Expo Museum in Shanghai, where the scientist\u2019s work is being celebrated in an exhibition that opened in August. Einstein visited the city in 1922, locals are proud to recall.", "Crowds have been flocking to see the memorabilia, which will be on display until late October. A big draw are Einstein\u2019s notes on special relativity, in which he sets out the formula E=mc\u00b2. There is no mention of how controversial even the famous theory once was in China. During Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution, it was attacked by some scholars in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They wrote a paper describing relativity as \u201ca profound reflection of Western bourgeois reactionary political viewpoints\u201d. In an attempt to restore sanity Zhou Enlai, who was then prime minister, eventually stepped in. \u201cThe Jewish nation has produced many outstanding talents. Marx was Jewish, so was Einstein,\u201d he said.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "The exhibition does not, however, explore Einstein\u2019s views on freedom of expression. These are revealed only among the souvenirs, one of which is a biography of Einstein by an American, Walter Isaacson. It describes the German-born scientist\u2019s nonconformity and hostility to state control. \u201cTyranny repulsed him, and he saw tolerance not simply as a sweet virtue but as a necessary condition for a creative society,\u201d it says. But the book is on sale only in English. There is nothing in Chinese at the exhibition that reveals Einstein\u2019s opinions on political freedom.", "This year, especially, the authorities are keen to avoid tricky questions about science and dissent. It is the 30th anniversary of pro-democracy unrest in Tiananmen Square that was crushed by the Chinese army with huge loss of life. Among the most vocal of the intellectuals who supported the protests were several Chinese physicists: Wang Ganchang, who led China\u2019s nuclear-weapons programme; Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist who later defected to America; and Xu Liangying, China\u2019s pre-eminent translator of Einstein\u2019s works.", "All three are now dead. Like the others, Xu kept calling for democracy into old age. Remarkably, however, Xu\u2019s work is acknowledged at the exhibition by a display of a translation in his handwriting. Curators sought advice from Xu\u2019s son and invited him to the opening.", "But this is no political thaw. Since Xi Jinping took over as China\u2019s leader in 2012, he has tightened the screws on dissent. Scientists have not been immune. Zheng Wenfeng, an associate professor at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in the south-western city of Chengdu, had the temerity this summer to question the significance of the \u201cfour great inventions\u201d: the compass, printing, papermaking and gunpowder. China cites these as evidence of its ancient scientific prowess. No patriot can question that. Mr Zheng was duly punished with two years\u2019 suspension from teaching. \u25a0"], "url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2019/09/19/an-exhibition-in-shanghai-celebrates-einsteins-genius", "title": "An exhibition in Shanghai celebrates Einstein\u2019s genius", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["scientists", "genius", "xus", "einstein", "celebrates", "chinas", "chinese", "einsteins", "zheng", "china", "shanghai", "exhibition", "political"]}
