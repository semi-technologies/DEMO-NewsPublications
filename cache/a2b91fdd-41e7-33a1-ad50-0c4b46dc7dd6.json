But right now, as more sectors transition to low-carbon models, every job has the potential to become \u201cgreen\u201d.", "With unemployment rising due to the pandemic, there\u2019s now a chance to reconfigure the jobs landscape while putting the environment centre stage. The government\u2019s \u00a3160m Build Back Greener investment scheme aims to create 2,000 new construction jobs to manufacture offshore wind turbines and upgrade ports.", "How and where will demand increase as the UK transitions to a net-zero economy?", "By 2030, there could be 694,000 green jobs in the low-carbon and renewable energy sector across England, rising to more than 1.18m by 2050. There\u2019s enormous potential for green growth.", "Research by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that more than 200,000 jobs could be created in energy efficiency by 2030, and 70,000 jobs in offshore wind alone as soon as 2023, while Thrive Renewables estimates that onshore renewables could deliver 45,000 new jobs by 2035. Regionally, opportunities vary. In north-west England, new jobs focus on increasing wind capacity, while London\u2019s green jobs will mostly be in the financial, IT or legal industries.", "Why do we need a decarbonised future?", "Economist Kate Raworth, from the University of Oxford\u2019s Environmental Change Institute, believes that we need a decarbonised economy far sooner than 2050. According to Raworth, the economy should urgently be redesigned so that resources aren\u2019t wasted. That, she says, requires serious innovation: \u201cOur future economy will thrive on reusing, repairing, refurbishing, remaking and repurposing \u2013 this transformation will create new kinds of creative and purposeful jobs.\u201d", "Reimagining the economy", "In 2018, the UK government projected that the low-carbon economy could grow by 11% per year up to 2030. That\u2019s much higher than the projected growth rate for the overall economy. Globally, emergency Covid-19 economic rescue packages already total more than \u00a36tn in G20 nations. In fact, the transition to net-zero emissions and investment in low-carbon sectors can aid recovery from Covid-19.", "\u201cGreen jobs help us realise environmental goals and contribute to livelihoods \u2013 it\u2019s not new, but it is an idea we are now paying more attention to,\u201d says Jennifer Allan, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University, who describes climate action as an \u201ceconomic multiplier\u201d, because creating green jobs helps mitigate the ecological crisis.", "'People want a job with purpose': why businesses are becoming more sustainable Read more", "In June 2020, Boris Johnson earmarked several billion pounds to upgrade the energy efficiency of public buildings and homes, and for carbon capture technology to remove harmful carbon emissions from the air. As a result, UK industry will also receive \u00a3350m investment to cut carbon emissions in sectors such as transport and construction.", "By comparison, France is planning to invest one third of its \u20ac100bn (\u00a390bn) post-Covid economic stimulus on greening the economy \u2013 more than any other big EU country \u2013 but critics insist that even this falls short of what is necessary for a step change.

Homeowners in England can now apply for vouchers worth up to \u00a35,000 to make their homes more energy efficient under the new government scheme for green home grants. Retrofitting homes could not only result in more efficient energy consumption but also create green jobs for those installing double glazing, insulation or air-source heat pumps.", "So home retrofits are a major win-win. \u201cIt\u2019s about a systemic shift, not isolated innovations,\u201d explains Eliot Whittington, director of policy at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL).", "A future fuelled by renewables?", "By 2035, new diesel, petrol or hybrid cars will no longer be sold in the UK, but cost remains a barrier to switching to electric vehicle (EV) production because big upfront investment is required. As industries evolve, upskilling of the workforce is essential, too \u2013 individuals will need retraining and financial support to make that viable.", "For clients of Nick Daniel, head of energy and climate change at the recruitment firm Acre, the climate emergency has become a board-level priority with many new sustainability roles being classified as \u201cbusiness critical\u201d, despite other hiring having been frozen.
