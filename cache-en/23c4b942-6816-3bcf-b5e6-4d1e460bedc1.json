Hockney, one of our most renowned painters, is now eighty-three, but he continues to be his peripatetic self. He was born in Yorkshire, England, and spent much of the nineteen-sixties and seventies in Los Angeles, producing portraits of friends, lovers, and relatives. For the past year, he\u2019s been sheltering in place in a half-timbered, seventeenth-century house in Normandy, France, with his partner, Jean-Pierre Gon\u00e7alves de Lima. I went to visit them there in October; we were not far from Monet\u2019s house in Giverny. Hockney has always drawn from the people and landscapes around him\u2014he spent nine years in Bridlington, Yorkshire, and painted the seasons there\u2014and he\u2019s been doing the same in Normandy, capturing the tableau outside by using an iPad. (\u201cMa Normandie,\u201d an exhibition of Hockney\u2019s iPad work, is showing at the Galerie Lelong, in Paris, through February.) We recently spoke about experimenting with new techniques, and about his newest project, which is inspired by the art and nature near him.", "You\u2019ve been working a lot on the iPad. Why is it so compelling?", "Well, I drew on the iPad when it first came out, in 2010. I thought the app Brushes was just the best. But then they altered it: they made it a lot worse; it took you longer to find the brushes. And I stopped using it. In 2018, Jonathan Wilkinson, my technical assistant, said he could make a new app with a mathematician in Leeds. It was rather good, and then I got six or seven new brushes custom made. I did say I was drawing on the iPad, but actually I\u2019m painting on it. I\u2019ve got two hundred and twelve paintings done this year, with only eight more to do. I want those to be of black trees in rain or snow, but I\u2019m still waiting on the weather. Then I\u2019ll have done two hundred and twenty paintings for 2020.", "Inside the house in Normandy that Hockney shares with his partner, Jean-Pierre Gon\u00e7alves de Lima. Photograph by Jean Fremon", "What led you to resettle in Normandy?", "When I first came to Normandy with Jean-Pierre, two years ago, we stayed in Honfleur, and then we went to see the Bayeux Tapestry, which was the first time I\u2019d seen it since the sixties. Then we went to see the Apocalypse Tapestry, in Angers. At some point, on the way to Paris, Jean-Pierre said we could see this house. We only looked at one house, and we decided to get it. Then we went to Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e de Cluny and saw the \u201cLady and the Unicorn\u201d tapestries. So we saw three great tapestries of Europe within a week.", "\u201cIn Front of House Looking West,\u201d 2019.", "Why are the tapestries so interesting to you?", "They\u2019re marvellous\u2014I\u2019ve always wanted to do something like this. You move through time, and it\u2019s you who moves, not the pictures. I think that\u2019s very exciting. They think the Bayeux one was made in Canterbury and commissioned by the bishop of Bayeux, who was the half brother of William the Conqueror. It\u2019s not actually a tapestry; it\u2019s an embroidery. It\u2019s a marvellous thing, with wonderful colors still, even though it\u2019s nearly a thousand years old. It tells the story of the conquest of England over the course of a few years, and ends with the battle of Hastings. Well, now I\u2019m going to be telling a story that\u2019s one year in length, and it\u2019s not a battle; it\u2019s just nature changing.", "\u201cIn the Studio,\u201d 2019.", "Is that what you\u2019ll work on after you finish the 2020 drawings?", "Yes. I\u2019m going to paint the whole year in six very large panels. Each will be one and a half metres high by ten metres long. We\u2019ll be showing it first at the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie, in Paris. It\u2019ll be in a long corridor, so, as you walk down one side and up another, the seasons will change very slowly. The entire work will be sixty metres long. The Bayeux Tapestry is sixty-eight metres long, but it\u2019s going to be similar, because it\u2019s you that\u2019s going to move, not the pictures.", "\u201cNo Fire,\u201d 2020.", "I find it fascinating that centuries-old tapestries inspired you to work more on an iPad. And now you\u2019re returning to painting on canvas. Are you looking forward to that?", "Oh, yes, and I couldn\u2019t have done this two years ago. I\u2019m making it up now from all the drawings I\u2019ve done, all the trees I\u2019ve drawn. And this also involves new technology. We visited this canvas shop in Paris, Marin. The man came out here, and he was very excited with everything I\u2019ve done. They said they would stretch the canvases up in my studio first and then they\u2019d roll them up and stretch them in l\u2019Orangerie. They have a new canvas made for rolling up, just like a tapestry\u2014it\u2019s got linen and a synthetic fiber in it. You can\u2019t have thirty-foot-long pictures otherwise. How would you move them about? So we\u2019re working together on this. I think it could be rolled up for about five locations.", "And, right at the end, we might have snow. You can\u2019t guarantee snow in Normandy\u2014you can in Yorkshire, but not here. But Monet did paint snow here, so it can happen. And, in the last little bit, I have snow coming down and landing on the trees. So here I am, waiting for rain and snow.", "See below for more covers by David Hockney:"], "authors": ["Fran\u00e7oise Mouly", "Fran\u00e7oise Moul", "David Hockne"], "keywords": ["work", "went", "snow", "ipad", "hockneys", "paris", "hearth", "im", "tapestries", "david", "house", "tapestry", "hockney"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
