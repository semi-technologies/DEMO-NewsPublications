As she began building a following on Instagram, her pieces became increasingly more bold and playful. \u201cOn Instagram, people are drawn to things that are visually striking. Your eye automatically notices something that\u2019s brightly colored or that has a high contrast,\u201d she says. Instagram isn\u2019t the only place where the demand for her work has been noticed and picked up; stars such as Kim Kardashian West, Rosal\u00eda, and BbyMutha have all worn her spunky pieces too. \u201cI was not expecting [Kardashian West] at all,\u201d says Porter. \u201cHer team reached out and bought some pieces. Now, I\u2019m getting a lot of sales in L.A.\u201d", "The artist makes everything in her London studio herself, and uses two types of mesh for her garments: tulle mesh, which is see-through, and power mesh, which is stretchier and less transparent. She cuts the patterns herself, and applies imagery using fabric dye. \u201cEvery single one is different, and during the painting process, there\u2019s so much room for happy accidents, like the way the dye spills into other colors,\u201d Porter says. Her feed offers a wide range of prints, from abstract tie-dye turtlenecks to slithery, snake-inspired dresses. Porter says she mostly does custom orders, working with customers to pinpoint color combos and prints. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to remain sustainable. I know that someone\u2019s already buying it and I\u2019m not wasting materials,\u201d the artist says, adding that she averages two to three pieces a week. \u201cPlus, I can make it fit perfectly.\u201d", "Photo: Courtesy of Noon Cottage Industry", "While her designs are spontaneous and made in conversation with customers, Porter says the creations are also very much influenced by her filmmaking. (She describes her films as \u201cnonverbal visuals.\u201d) \u201cI think very much from a cinematographic perspective\u2014my placement in relation to an object, from an aerial view or from below\u2014so a lot of the images on my tops replicate that kind of point of view,\u201d she says. Even the hangers she shows her pieces on have artistic purpose; they\u2019re shaped in the form of sycamore seeds, of which she says, \u201cJust like how trees release sycamore seeds, I\u2019m releasing these garments out into the world.\u201d Porter says fusing art and fashion has proven to be a new experience for her altogether\u2014but given her current amount of star-studded fans, it\u2019s clearly working. She likes how tangible and personal the process of creating fashion is. \u201cIt just made sense to me to put ideas or imagery onto something that could be bought instantly,\u201d she says. \u201c[Art] doesn\u2019t need to exist in a gallery space.\u201d"], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["pieces", "visual", "working", "handdyed", "view", "mesh", "west", "sycamore", "im", "porter", "feast", "way", "tops", "instagram"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
