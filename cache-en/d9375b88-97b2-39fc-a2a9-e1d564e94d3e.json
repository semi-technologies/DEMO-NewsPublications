The holiday concerts are \u201cabout creating an atmosphere,\u201d Bird said recently. \u201cThat\u2019s what seasonal music is to me\u2014how do we get through the dark, cold months?\u201d The Gothic Revival church is made cozier by Bird\u2019s stagecraft, including colored lights and a mesmerizing red-and-white contraption: a two-headed rotating speaker called a Janus Spinning Horn, made by the Chicago luthier Ian Schneller. \u201cIt\u2019s like a cross between a flower and a Victrola horn,\u201d Bird said, on a Zoom from a sunny hilltop in Ojai, California. This holiday season, he and his family are staying put in California, and, on December 13th, he will live-stream \u201cGezelligheid\u201d from Ojai. \u201cI\u2019m going to string up some caf\u00e9 lights and do it at sunset,\u201d he said. Otherwise, \u201cit\u2019s probably exactly what you\u2019re looking at\u201d: Oriental rug, Janus Spinning Horn, oak tree, orange groves, Topatopa Mountains. As Bird picked up his violin to play, the Janus Horn began to spin, like an amaryllis sending out an alarm signal.", "Bird, forty-seven, is tall and lean, with dark hair and a serious expression. He tends to dress in a gently old-fashioned style\u2014button-down shirts, the occasional fedora or vest\u2014and when he, a non-actor, was recruited to play an earnest mortician in the current season of \u201cFargo,\u201d set in mid-century Kansas City, it made intuitive sense. (His character, Thurman Smutny, whistles when he\u2019s happy, is na\u00efve about the criminal underworld, and says things like \u201cIt\u2019s sigh-o-relief o\u2019clock around here at the ol\u2019 Smutny household.\u201d) Bird grew up in Lake Bluff, outside Chicago, and began playing the violin at age four. \u201cI\u2019m very close with my mom\u201d\u2014Beth Bird, a print artist\u2014\u201cand she\u2019s the one who started me on violin,\u201d he said. \u201cShe tried to learn to play herself, out of solidarity.\u201d Later, he got a bachelor\u2019s in violin performance at Northwestern, and played with the jazz-swing combo Squirrel Nut Zippers, and with his own group, Andrew Bird\u2019s Bowl of Fire; since 2003, as a solo artist, he\u2019s excelled at doing his own thing.", "This fall, he released \u201cHark!,\u201d a holiday album, which, like this year\u2019s concert, offers beauty, and a mood of distanced coziness: gezelligheid \u00e0 la mode. Plaintive yearning abounds. \u201cChristmas in April,\u201d which Bird wrote as lockdown came, in March\u2014\u201c \u2018March\u2019 would not have been the most lyrical-sounding\u201d\u2014hopes for \u201cno more sorrow, and no more fear\u201d and wonders about Yuletide togetherness: \u201cOh, my love, when will we know / If we can meet under the mistletoe?\u201d It\u2019s \u201ca fairly simple, sentimental song,\u201d Bird said. \u201cBut, whenever you know that you and most of the populace are thinking the same thing, that\u2019s kind of an extraordinary moment.\u201d His \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d heightens the song\u2019s natural wistfulness with cascading strings that evoke the eerie falling flowers in \u201cOde to Billie Joe.\u201d In \u201cAlabaster\u201d (\u201cKeep your lamp on, keep your lamp on\u201d), he wanted to \u201ccapture a sense of walking in Chicago at night, and looking in the warm glow of apartment buildings, wondering what people\u2019s lives are like in there.\u201d \u201cGreenwine\u201d merges \u201cGreensleeves\u201d\u2014\u201cone of those darker, minor-key Christmas tunes\u201d\u2014with a Handsome Family song about a \u201cdysfunctional relationship, and alcoholism, with Christmas as a backdrop.\u201d John Prine\u2019s \u201cSouvenirs\u201d sings of melted snow, broken toys, and faded colors. Yet it all feels pretty good.", "As lockdown began, Bird said, the album \u201c \u2018Paris 1919\u2019 was on our stereo non-stop, because my nine-year-old son is our household d.j., and he got really into John Cale.\u201d (So was Lou Reed\u2019s \u201cTransformer,\u201d Bird said: \u201cMy son probably has better taste than I do.\u201d) Cale, who is Welsh, composed \u201cParis 1919\u201d in 1972, when he was working in L.A. and feeling nostalgic for Europe. Its snowy, dreamy \u201cAndalucia\u201d is \u201ccomforting and mysterious at the same time, which is, I think, the ideal description of a Christmas song,\u201d Bird said. \u201cIt\u2019s the melancholy. Melancholy is not sad\u2014it\u2019s about half and half the mixture of happy and sad.\u201d Bird, plucking his violin like a guitar, begins \u201cHark!\u201d with a delicate cover of it: \u201cAndalucia, when can I see ya?\u201d", "Bird included some of his mother\u2019s favorite holiday songs on \u201cHark!,\u201d which also features her artwork on the cover: a red-yellow-and-smoky-black painting of a winged, lantern-bearing gentleman floating above a village, in a mood of Toulouse-Lautrec-meets-Chagall whimsy. \u201cNot being able to see each other, it was nice to have this project to connect on,\u201d Bird said. \u201cShe\u2019s been my No. 1 collaborator over the years.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Sarah Larson", "Sarah Larso"], "keywords": ["hark", "horn", "christmas", "holiday", "play", "janus", "bird", "melancholy", "song", "birds", "cozy", "violin", "andrew", "chicago"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
