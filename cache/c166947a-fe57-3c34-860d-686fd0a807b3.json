Tayyaba Urooj, a 45-year-old mother, was among them, and had brought nine of her relatives from Karachi along for the trip. \u201cAlhamdulillah, the train just started. We want it to succeed and for Pakistan to succeed,\u201d says Urooj in the packed carriage. \u201cI am a little worried because it\u2019s congested \u2013 but it\u2019s Pakistan, so there\u2019s always a rush.\u201d", "The number-one group this train will benefit is women \u2013 they don\u2019t usually have their own vehicles Kiran Dar, politician", "\u201cThe more people who use this metro, the more beneficial it will be for our country,\u201d says Badar Shahzad, 49, who welcomed the large crowds. \u201cNinety-five per cent of people riding it don\u2019t even have anywhere to go \u2013 they\u2019re just enjoying the journey,\u201d he adds, pointing to kids snapping away with their phones.", "At 27km this is one of the largest metro projects under Xi Jinping\u2019s belt and road initiative, bringing a grinding two-and-a-half hour commute across the sprawling city down to under an hour. It promises to reduce traffic, decrease pollution, and provide a cheaper way to get around one of south Asia\u2019s most transport-starved cities. Financed by the Pakistani government and a $1.6bn loan from China\u2019s Exim Bank, the train is jointly operated by China Railway and Norinco International, one of China\u2019s largest engineering contractors.

More than 50 Orange Line workers have died, highlighting the country\u2019s labour problems, including its pattern of relying on precarious, subcontracted workers for large infrastructure projects, as well as weak enforcement of relevant laws.", "Workers were kept hidden in the camps. Their living conditions were miserable Khalid Mahmood, Labour Education Foundation", "In January 2017, seven labourers died and more than a dozen were injured in a fire at a temporary shelter housing Orange Line workers. There was a series of gruesome incidents during construction, from workers being electrocuted when a crane collided with cables to men being crushed in their sleep by a collapsing wall. In July 2016, following the death of a worker, some Orange Line labourers deemed the work too hazardous and initiated a strike, claiming the government was prioritising the speed of the project over workers\u2019 lives.", "Labour activists say that the majority of incidents happened because labourers were not directly employed by the government or Chinese contractors, but by a convoluted network of Pakistani subcontractors who brought in workers from south Punjab on low wages and little health and safety protection.", "\u201cThere were major violations of the rights of workers,\u201d says Khalid Mahmood, director of the Lahore-based Labour Education Foundation, who visited workers after the 2017 fire and discovered they had no contracts.", "\u201cUnions were not able to go inside the work sites. No one was allowed to meet these workers,\u201d Mahmood tells the Guardian. \u201cThese workers were kept hidden in the camps. Their living conditions were miserable.\u201d Mahmood points out that Pakistani law offers protections and rights that labourers were not made aware of. He says his attempts to locate worker contracts at construction sites were undermined by the lack of information from companies. \u201cThere was no transparency.

In 2018, Khan made the murky financial details of projects such as the Orange Line a focus of his anti-corruption drive, launching a commission to investigate how contracts were awarded, the costs involved and the level of transparency.", "Despite Khan\u2019s criticism, in recent years Pakistan\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and poor transport network has seen the country aggressively court more than $60bn in Chinese loans to finance big-ticket development projects \u2013 which observers say will plunge the debt-ridden country deeper into a financial quagmire. Pakistan\u2019s external debt now amounts to 45% of its GDP.", "At the final stop at Lahore\u2019s Dera Gujran terminal, the passengers seem unconcerned by the economic realities.
