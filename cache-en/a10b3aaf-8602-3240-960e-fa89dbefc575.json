They can\u2019t afford to", "be anything", "less than comp e", "t", "e", "nt. Masks Off", "The biopic. What an awful genre. What an awful name for a genre. Awful because it sounds like medicine. Awful because it\u2019s too easy to confuse the actor for the person they\u2019re playing, too tempting to scrutinize the minutiae of verisimilitude. (Well she just didn\u2019t sound like Aretha to me!) I\u2019m in favor of junking the whole category and instead begging more people to pull a Radha Blank: Make a biopic about yourself.", "I know what you\u2019re thinking: Radha who? To which I say, \u201cExactly!\u201d Blank is a New York playwright who wrote, directed, produced and starred in \u201cThe Forty-Year-Old Version,\u201d a comedy, in black and white, about a New York playwright named Radha Blank. Radha, like Blank, was once one of those Off Broadway up-and-comers who now finds herself teaching playwriting to high schoolers in Harlem, breaking up fights, fending off their lust. But suddenly she\u2019s busy again, torn between the reignition of her theater career and her renewed attraction to hip-hop. She starts rapping, and the songs serve a typical rap function \u2014 as personal therapy and social commentary. Her first track is called \u201cPoverty Porn,\u201d and it wonders whether the theater, with its hunger for Black suffering, has estranged her from her Brooklyn roots. The producer who supplies her beats tells her what we already suspect of her new play \u2014 it\u2019s wack. But she needs to hear that from herself.", "You can imagine an executive suggesting that somebody starrier play Radha: a Queen Latifah, a Fantasia Barrino. But long before it\u2019s over, you\u2019re certain that Blank is the only woman for the job. If the character has her doubts \u2014 about the depth of her talent, about the thickness of her body \u2014 Blank doesn\u2019t hesitate to throw them in the mix. She\u2019s feisty, huffy, exuberant, present, ready for everything and very funny. When she finally has sex with that producer, his prowess so overwhelms her that she pauses her ecstasy to blurt out: \u201cYeah. That\u2019s a young tongue there.\u201d Here we have a persona \u2014 a neurotic, insecure self-adventurer \u2014 that could power a dozen more movies, the way Woody Allen\u2019s did. Only Blank is harder on herself. For stretches of the film, she\u2019s deep in thought, making no one laugh, inspecting her authenticity for cracks.", "Hannah Gadsby \u25cf Photograph by Mamadi Doumbouya These women are pursuing truth writ", "small, personally, looking for it", "in daring", "performa n", "c", "es.", "We\u2019ve spent years warring over the truth and whether we can restore any trust in it. Blank is in a class of artists engaged in a risky parallel quest for honesty. Its ranks include the live storytelling of Hannah Gadsby, the giddy psychodramas of Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle playing their teenage alter egos on \u201cPen15\u201d and the bleak sexual traumas that Michaela Coel plumbed on \u201cI May Destroy You.\u201d These women are pursuing truth writ small, personally, looking for it in daring performances \u2014 not of national heroes but of themselves, this fecund terra incognita.", "The onscreen autofictional urge isn\u2019t new. The movies\u2019 sound era essentially began this way, with Al Jolson playing a version of himself in \u201cThe Jazz Singer,\u201d the story of how his attraction to blackface wins out over his Jewish roots. Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali played themselves in movies about their lives. So, basically, have the Beatles, 50 Cent and Eminem; John Malkovich and Jean-Claude Van Damme. There was a kick to watching actors burst through the fourth wall, going meta. On television, the conflation of star and subject was less magical: The coziness of the medium practically demanded a romance of the self, collapsing the border between someone like Jerry Seinfeld and \u201cJerry Seinfeld.\u201d", "The high-water mark for this sort of auto-comedy remains Larry David\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d David was a creator of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and, performing on his own show, cranked crankiness to an ear-shattering volume. The show\u2019s appeal was its extremity. I suspect each of these women has at least some passing familiarity with David. But they\u2019re pushing past him. Even when David\u2019s antics cost him, the price is never that high. He is an athlete of etiquette, and his adversaries enjoy the contest. These women are interested in the consequences of their choices. They tether obnoxiousness to thunderous feeling and look at themselves more harshly in order to arrive, if not at peace, then at some kind of self-understanding.", "Each of these performers is funny. But their humor never fails to find confusion, pain, melancholy and rage that pool outward toward some tragic zone, as if comedy itself is wounded and in need of introspection. Encounters with misogyny course through this work. So does the anticipation of it. At some point, Radha dresses down that producer for failing to escort her to the subway after she leaves his studio in the wee hours, weary and high. A montage immediately reveals that he did, in fact, walk her out. It\u2019s an accusation made in error but clearly rooted in experience. The amazement of all of this work is its makers\u2019 willingness to expose their weakness.", "Radha Blank \u25cf Photograph by Malike Sidibe The", "pleasure of watching arises from their dexterity", "at perform", "ing them", "selves \u2014 not as elegant but as klutzy, volatile, occasionally unstable.", "Confidence is, paradoxically, central to that power. The title of Blank\u2019s movie remixes \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin,\u201d Judd Apatow\u2019s boys\u2019-club hit from 2005, and insinuates that what might have been missing from it was her. Hannah Gadsby uses might to pry minds open. She\u2019s an owlish Australian, who spends the bulk of her second stand-up show, \u201cDouglas,\u201d on Netflix, processing the hostile reaction to her first, which traditionalists objected to because it refused to be traditionally hilarious. Instead, Gadsby called out the hostilities of those traditions, their contempt for women. The achievement of the new show is subtle but transformative. In the opening 15 minutes, she lays out the evening\u2019s structure, the topics and their order. Gadsby has autism; this gambit is not for us; it\u2019s for her. She finds the explication of a structure comforting. It steadies her wit and frees her blood to boil. She can be knowingly, adroitly castigating. In a rant against anti-vaxxers, she takes a second to assert that, as a woman with autism, she\u2019s the embodiment of the community\u2019s paranoia. Her tone is somewhere between bemused and furious. Her intrepidness is moving, like watching someone defuse a grenade by swallowing it.", "When she reaches full pique or nails an item on her agenda, the aperture of her mouth shrinks into the tiniest and most brutal of gapes. You doubted me? Don\u2019t do that. It must be said that some of that surprise is that you don\u2019t expect this kind of surgical wrath from someone so fashionably bespectacled and in such flashy Nikes and a suit of such vivid, affable blue, someone who looks like the director of a tugboat library.", "It is the ideal attire for the art-history lectures sprinkled throughout her 75-minute set. This is Gadsby\u2019s strongest mode: warrior art critic. In the first show, \u201cNanette,\u201d she inveighed against the world\u2019s misapprehension of Van Gogh\u2019s suffering and the circumnavigation of Picasso\u2019s misogyny. This time, armed with a slide show, she goes after Renaissance-era ludicrousness. Why exactly does the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle franchise invoke Donatello? And spare a thought, please, for women in the era\u2019s paintings. Why are they so uselessly depicted in threes? What is that sheet of gauze doing between that lady\u2019s butt cheeks in a Rubens painting? Even though she told us she was going there, her arrival is all the more thrilling since you don\u2019t expect this sort of comedic force from someone wielding a clicker.", "Gadsby\u2019s command is exciting. The pleasure of watching the other four women, too, arises from their dexterity at performing themselves \u2014 not as elegant but as klutzy, volatile, occasionally unstable. On \u201cPen15,\u201d Erskine and Konkle are two adults playing Maya and Anna, middle-school besties. It\u2019s entirely possible to watch the show oblivious to the casting conceit (the other kids are played, marvelously, by actual kids). Erskine and Konkle are so adept at the relentless emotional simultaneity of adolescence \u2014 bliss and mortification, incoherence and clarity, terror and bravery, codependence and solitude, softness and fury \u2014 that you surrender to the gimmick, if that\u2019s even the right concept for what they\u2019re up to.", "Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine \u25cf Photographs by Djeneba Aduayom Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine \u25cf Photographs by Djeneba Aduayom They\u2019ve tuned in", "to", "a particular frequency of perfor mance that risks being", "cringed at", "and dismissed as selfish.", "Officially, the comedy revolves around hormones and intimacy, around the performance of childhood in an adult body \u2014 the sight, say, of Erskine in a boy\u2019s wrestling singlet; the time when Anna makes a slow-mo exit from a minivan, and the sun hits Konkle\u2019s face so that her attempt at looking hot also looks as if she\u2019s cramping. In the new season, they deepen the show\u2019s physical comedy into gutsy pathos \u2014 exploding at their mothers (Maya\u2019s is played, with regal plainness, by Mutsuko Erskine, her actual mom), messing with each other\u2019s minds, humiliating themselves with boys. Together, they have located in the wilderness of adolescence a tenderness unlike any I\u2019ve ever seen.", "There\u2019s but one Michaela Coel, yet she appears to have quadrupled Erskine and Konkle\u2019s psychological load. Her character, Arabella Essiedu, is a popular internet presence who\u2019s recovering from a rape she suffered while out partying one night. She doesn\u2019t know who did it but stakes out the site of the London bar where it happened, hoping to trigger herself into remembering. She tries working the experience into a book she\u2019s contracted to write, motivated, in part, by her publisher\u2019s salivating at the topic. But the deadline and the long-spent advance money stress her as much as the mystery of her assailant.", "It\u2019s not crucial to know that Arabella is essentially Coel\u2019s alter ego, that she, too, was raped and that the character\u2019s regular returns to the primal scene are essentially the performer\u2019s. It\u2019s all there in Coel\u2019s face (big eyes, sharp cheekbones, dark brown skin), a flip book of moods and mind states (insouciance, wonder, puckishness, spite, nothing), a face you watch the life go out of over and over, an astounding graveyard of visages.", "Coel\u2019s strategy differs from encounter to encounter. Arabella files a police report, and as she explains to a detective what happened, Coel keeps her face blank but allows the pressure system of panic and suppression to extract tears. Trauma is a tough thing to act. It\u2019s everything an audience isn\u2019t supposed to see but must intuit is there. Coel raises the degree of difficulty to \u201cimpossible\u201d and exceeds it. She\u2019s out to disturb, first by seducing us into laughing at Arabella\u2019s recklessness then by daring us to reckon with the wages of her narcissism.", "Arabella experiences a second, more ambiguous assault by a fellow writer that she avenges by publicly outing him. Revenge intensifies her capital on the internet where fans become her armor, and the power souses her. With her ego bruised, possibly gone, the id has stepped in to fill the void and have a field day insulting her friends, soaking up the vacant social media adulation, disregarding advice to get actual support. The show\u2019s dozen episodes amount to 12 stages of grief. And Coel works through them with the control of a pilot, a jockey, a geometer, a shrink.", "Each of these performances triumphantly bends comedy to its will. The genre had already been evolving and expanding for women (Amy Schumer, Tiffany Haddish, Abbi Jacobson, Ilana Glazer, Maria Bamford, Ali Wong, Pamela Adlon) to make riotous reforms. What Blank and Coel and company have done is raise the stakes; in a sense, they\u2019ve put their lives on the line for our delight. They\u2019ve tuned in to a particular frequency of performance that risks being cringed at and dismissed as selfish, as though flagrance weren\u2019t a region of the human condition. It\u2019s just that, as Gadsby might tell you, nobody\u2019s used to seeing women act this way \u2014 leaping into the deep end instead of being pushed."], "authors": ["Wesley Morris"], "keywords": ["act", "erskine", "coel", "used", "shes", "konkle", "watching", "women", "comedy", "blank", "way", "radha", "gadsby", "seeing"], "pubDate": "2020-12-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
