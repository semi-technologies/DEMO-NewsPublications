Yet most of us have a memory, perhaps from childhood, probably involving a plastic bag of stale bread, when we were harangued by one of these quarrelsome birds who had seemingly woken up on the wrong side of the pond. We are used to playing as morally complex individuals in video games; even the heroes typically leave a genocidal trail of dead behind them. Never before, however, have I felt so appalled by my virtual acts as in Untitled Goose Game, which casts its player as a lone goose on a singular mission to victimise the residents of an English village via a thousand mundane, misery-making ways.", "There\u2019s the elderly man playing a game of darts in the pub garden. Nosing your beak from the leaves of a nearby bush, you\u2019ll notice how every now and again he\u2019ll perch on a nearby stool to rest his legs. It would be a shame if someone were to yank the seat away just as he sat down, wouldn\u2019t it? Then there\u2019s the gardener tending his vegetable patch close to an idle sprinkler. What would happen if someone squeaked on the tap just as he was leaning in to get a better look at his carrots? In Untitled Goose Game you must often think like Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton: surveying each new scene for its slapstick potential as you seek to fulfil the handful of back-of-a-postcard objectives set by the game\u2019s authors. Then again, sometimes being a quintessentially horrible goose requires nothing more than honking loudly and flapping one\u2019s wings at a passerby (then grabbing the terrified child\u2019s glasses after they fall to the ground). Honk!", "Untitled Goose Game began as a joke in an online chat room shared by the developers, a lavish sort of answer to the observation: \u201cMan! What\u2019s the deal with geese, eh?\u201d The game quickly found an obsessed following on social media, thanks to a number of brilliantly funny clips showing a low-polygon goose being awful. What has elevated Untitled Goose Game above a simple, one-note gag (and from being any of the 10,000 poorer variations of how the idea might have turned out in less-able hands) is the finesse of its ideas and the precision of its observations. The goose waddles with exactly the authentic combination of conceit and threat, the comic waggle of its tail feathers juxtaposed with the menace of its rasping tongue. There\u2019s a throb of joyful recognition when, having cowed a villager, you waddle away while issuing a belligerent farewell honk. Classic goose!", "Here, animation becomes character. When, with the squeeze of a button, the bird puffs out its chest and beats its wings in an effort to intimidate a broom-wielding human opponent, there\u2019s a mixture of animal fury and pitiful inelegance at play. Witness the magical transition when the goose moves from splashing awkwardly into water to streaking, with sophisticated swiftness, through its surface. Despite the children\u2019s colouring-book aesthetic, it all feels so true, and in this way you are forced to consider, like the game\u2019s developers before you, the essence of goose.", "A goose is nothing without a community to bother, and in this dialogue-free world the game\u2019s villagers provide the perfect foils. Some stand up to your antics, shooing you away with mops and flapping arms; others cringe and protect their necks, doubled over in fear and dismay. Peculiar delight is to be had when entering a middle Englander\u2019s fenced domain \u2013 the amateur artist who paints at an easel among the ornaments of her garden, or the beslippered man who reads his newspaper in the sun, sucking on a pipe. The gleeful havoc a goose can wreak in the provincial context!", "Repeatedly, while playing Untitled Goose Game I found myself saying to those watching: \u201cImagine a goose doing this?!\u201d And of course we all could. While the ornithologists may be readying their snippy \u201cactually, geese are benign and misunderstood\u201d letters of response, everyone who has ever been a child with a bag of bread at the pond knows the terrible truth.", "Also recommended", "", "Sayonara Wild Hearts", "(Simogo; Annapurna Interactive; Nintendo Switch, iOS)", "Released to coincide with the launch of Apple Arcade, the tech giant\u2019s new Netflix-style game subscription service, Sayonara Wild Hearts is billed by its Swedish makers as a \u201cpop album video game\u201d. You play as a young woman navigating the shards of a heartbreak on a magical motorcycle, streaking through neon-lit skies to a soundtrack of Chvrches-esque electro-synth-pop. Guiding her path through a series of 60-second long levels, you must collect throbbing hearts while dodging obstacles.", "Abstract vignettes see you pursuing wolves in high-speed forest chases or engaging in skateboard gunfights through a Tokyo-like city. The game expands and embellishes its ideas in step with its fizzing tracks, which sustain second and third listens as you try to beat your score. Stylish, memorable game-making."], "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
