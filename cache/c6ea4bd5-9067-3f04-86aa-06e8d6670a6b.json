Squadrons\u2019 single-player campaign, which has you fly as a Rebel and Imperial pilot both, is set in the years immediately following the events of 1983\u2019s Return of the Jedi, offering a new installment in the never-ending conflict between the resurgent New Republic and the creaking old Empire.", "But the Empire of Squadrons looks, admittedly, pretty different from how it was depicted in Return of the Jedi, or any of the rest of the films from which it bases the majority of its aesthetic. The uniforms may be as crisply and meticulously arranged, the enormous hangars swathed in the same metallic gray durasteel, but its soldiers, and its officers in particular, rather than the wrinkled old white men we\u2019ve come to expect, are mostly young people of color.", "Titan Squadron, the Imperial unit the player spends half the campaign flying in, is led by Captain Terisa Kerrill (Peta Sergeant), an Asian woman with a buoyant blonde pompadour, who reports directly to Grand Admiral Rae Sloane (Dionne Aduain), a Black woman. Though the New Republic is just as diverse, if not more so, and the character options for both sides of the conflict feature more minority characters than not, it\u2019s particularly striking to see the classically white, male Empire being run by women of color, commanding diverse squadrons and answering to no one but themselves.", "When picturing the Galactic Empire, it\u2019s difficult to imagine anything besides Admiral Tarkin\u2019s grim visage or Emperor Palpatine\u2019s wizened old mug. It\u2019s thus downright dissonant, particularly within a structure so tied to violence, power, and masculine authority to see such a multicultural cast proudly taking on the Imperial mission.", "Imperial Diversity", "When, in the first few moments of the trailer for 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens, a familiarly white-suited stormtrooper removed his helmet to reveal himself as the Black British actor John Boyega, parts of the internet exploded in uproar. The hashtag #blackstormtrooper racked up posts on social media as users registered their disbelief at the idea that a Black man could ever serve as a stormtrooper. Despite the noxious racism behind these complaints, they contained an unintentional kernel of truth. It has, after all, only ever been the rainbow-coalition Rebellion that\u2019s been allowed to showcase any form of diversity in the Star Wars films. The sole named Black character in the original trilogy, Lando Calrissian, played by the remarkable Billy Dee Williams, may have done deals with the Empire, but he is remembered most of all as a hero of the Rebellion. That pattern continues to today. Boyega\u2019s FN-2187 in The Force Awakens soon adopts the more humanized moniker \u201cFinn\u201d after joining up with the righteous New Republic. Finn and Lando\u2019s ethical realignments are further reenacted in Squadrons\u2019 campaign: Captain Lindon Javes (Phil Morris) betrays his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Kerrill and switches sides to join the rebels, citing his principled objection to the Empire, preempting, surely, complaints of his being a poor cultural fit.", "While the problematic nature of Black and brown folks proudly participating in an organization steeped in bold-faced fascism may be superficially self-evident, Squadrons also finds compelling ways to highlight and address it. Squadrons spends much of the Imperial side of the plot unraveling the warring ideologies duking it out within the remains of the Empire. At several points throughout the game, Kerrill\u2019s group runs up against the calcified holdovers of the Empire\u2019s past glory; old white men who look directly transplanted out of the late-'70s casting calls the original trilogy\u2019s olive-suited bureaucrats were staffed from, down to their posh accents and thinning blond coifs.", "In the mission, \u201cThe Trail from Desevro,\u201d while stealthily trailing a fleet of New Republic engineers, Kerrill\u2019s Titan Squadron is interrupted by a belligerent and bellicose Captain Amos, who thrusts his battered Star Destroyer into the middle of the fray, sneering that \u201csnuffing out this New Republic is the only mission.\u201d He ignores all of Kerrill\u2019s warnings, succeeding only at blowing her cover right before getting himself blown to bits by the alerted rebel fleet."], "authors": ["Yussef Cole", "Yussef Col"], "keywords": ["white", "wars", "squadrons", "explores", "imperial", "fascism", "kerrills", "changing", "black", "republic", "empire", "face", "star", "old"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
