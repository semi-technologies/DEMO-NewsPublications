The rising star is front and center in the forthcoming Gossip Girl reboot and has killer style to boot. A Hollywood veteran at 18, Lind\u2014who has been acting since 2008\u2014is set to play a brand new character in the series, which focuses on a new generation of prep school Manhattanites.", "Despite being thrust in the franchise that gave the world Serena van der Woodsen\u2019s and Blair Waldorf\u2019s spin on preppy, Lind is more about Parisian chic. The actress, who attended the virtual show for Saint Laurent\u2019s spring/summer 2021 collection today, remembers being captivated by the eternal cool of Catherine Deneuve in head to toe Yves. \u201cI remember seeing a photo of her in a Saint Laurent tux circa 1966,\u201d Lind shared via email. \u201cIt shaped the way I saw fashion early on. I will always love seeing a woman in a suit. Saint Laurent revolutionized androgynous dressing, and by doing so has contributed to feminism and equality.\u201d", "Given her appreciation for originality and youthful insouciance, Lind was the right person to carry off Anthony Vaccarello\u2019s daring latex designs. En route to her apartment pre-show, she gave a few of the latest Saint Laurent pieces a spin around the Lower East Side. Though her debut front row experience happened virtually with guest tuning in on their laptops instead of beneath the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Lind dressed in the latest collections and enjoyed a beauty moment with makeup artist, Misha Shazada and hairstylist, Olivia Halpin. Throughout it all Lind was impressed by how close she felt to all the action. \u201cI think human connection is essential, but seeing how artists have relentlessly found new ways to showcase their work even in these hard times is refreshing and inspiring,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Saint Laurent show was captivating and made us feel close though we are physically far.\u201d", "Here, the rising star takes Vogue and her pre-show routine from early morning cereal to a trip on the F train."], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["saint", "spin", "star", "gave", "gossip", "goes", "girls", "lind", "laurent", "latest", "preshow", "newest", "seeing", "virtual", "rising"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
