He starts work every evening at seven. His mode of transport of choice is a Vespa, but if it\u2019s raining he\u2019ll rent a car. He works until five or six the next morning, on weekends he\u2019ll often continue until one in the afternoon the next day. \u201cWhen I get home I smoke a joint and sleep the rest of the day, until my alarm goes off again at six.\u201d", "It\u2019s Sunday evening and Jamal pulls up in a rented Volkswagen Golf. \u201cCar rental companies collaborate with the drug dealers. They build hiding places in the vehicles, where you can also conceal weapons.\u201d", "He speeds precariously through the Amsterdam West district. \u201cSorry about the rush, but I have to go to some customers out of town later on, up north. They\u2019re a couple in an open relationship, sometimes I join in with their parties, but not tonight. I still have a lot of work to do in town.\u201d", "Weekends are always busy, as is the festival season and the ADE (Amsterdam Dance Event). Every month it gets crazy when people receive their benefits and salaries, says Jamal. \u201cRound about the 24th of the month is bonanza time for dealers.\u201d", "Plainclothes cops", "Last week saw the publication of a report by investigative journalist Jan Tromp and professor Pieter Tops, revealing that drug criminals have a major impact on public life in Amsterdam and that the authorities have lost control. Amsterdam is the hub of the European cocaine trade and a bag of coke is usually delivered faster than a pizza. Jamal concurs: \u201cThere are about 10,000 dealers working in Amsterdam, including nice middle-class lads from the south of town. Some sell a kilo a week, others twenty grams.\u201d", "A police van passes by. \u201cDid you see them looking at us?\u201d He\u2019s not scared, except maybe of plainclothes officers. \u201cBut I have a sixth sense for them, I recognise them immediately.\u201d Apart from one time he was stopped on the street \u2013 he shows us video footage of the incident on his phone \u2013 the police don\u2019t trouble him much. \u201cThe cops are too preoccupied by assassinations to bother with us. The other day a neighbourhood cop approached a colleague of mine. Just asked him to park somewhere less conspicuous. The Dutch police are a joke.\u201d", "He asks if it\u2019s okay for him to smoke a cigarette and he opens the car windows. His mobile rings. Two women calling on Facetime, the night is still young and they order a gram (\u20ac60). They exchange a few brief sentences and Jamal zips down Witte de Withstraat towards the Kinker neighbourhood. The phone rings again: Is he nearly there yet?", "A young woman waits on the street corner. Jamal parks the car and walks over to her. The entire transaction is over in a matter of seconds and he gets back in the car and drives away quickly. \u201cShe snorts about six bags a week, together with her mother.\u201d", "A bright future", "Jamal\u2019s parents came to Amsterdam from Morocco in the 1980s. He grew up in the Bos en Lommer district in a family of eight children. \u201cAs a kid I wanted to become a lawyer. I\u2019ve spoken to plenty of them, but not as a student.\u201d Jamal took commerce & administration at school. \u201cOne of my teachers saw a bright future for me. I don\u2019t think she meant in the drug trade, though.\u201d", "The prospect of a quick buck was alluring and he got into robberies. He served three years for that. \u201cI got out when I was 23. I started dealing when I was still inside and just carried on afterwards.\u201d Despite all of this, Jamal seems polite, smart and charming. \u201cYou might not think so, but I\u2019m a really peace-loving guy. I don\u2019t much like violence. Or rather: I don\u2019t like it at all.\u201d An hour later he shows us a video of a bed covered in automatic weapons. \u201cYou always have to be prepared.\u201d", "Jamal works together with Mo. They usually take turns delivering, sometimes they go together, it\u2019s totally up to them. \u201cWe buy the gear in Rotterdam. The price of a kilo of coke fluctuates, just like the price of gold. A kilo currently costs 28,000 euros. Selling it retail will earn you about 60,000 euros.\u201d", "Most weekday nights they do an average of ten to fifteen runs, at weekends and during festivals the number is much higher. The money they earn (\u201cwe count it every two days\u201d), a total of 10,000 euros a month, is transferred straight to Morocco. \u201cWe invest in land and real estate over there. We keep a minimum of three thousand euros for ourselves.\u201d", "We drive through Jamal\u2019s neighbourhood, Bos en Lommer, on the way to a colleague of his in Slotervaart where he\u2019s going to pick up some bags of coke and some pills. He points out the window. \u201cThis is where they shot the TV series Mocro Maffia. That bar over there is a criminal den. You have to earn your wings here, as a newcomer you can\u2019t just turn up and start dealing in a neighbourhood. If you do, the hyenas will find you and steal everything off you. That\u2019s never happened to us, though.\u201d", "Many of their customers live in the West district, but he delivers all over town, from the Zuidas business district to residential Zuidoost. \u201cOur customers include lawyers and managing directors, famous DJs, top chefs, the CEO of a big sports brand, entrepreneurs \u2013 they all know how to find us. But prostitutes and tourists in the Red Light district also get my number from guys on the street.\u201d", "In the three years they\u2019ve been dealing, they\u2019ve witnessed a lot. \u201cSex parties in hotel rooms, totally coked-up punters, women offering to pay in kind. Nothing much surprises me anymore.\u201d Jamal shows us a video of a pretty woman. \u201cShe works in the nightlife and she\u2019s a good customer of ours. Through her we often get into exclusive after-parties.\u201d", "Drug abuse", "In Mo\u2019s kitchen, they transfer coke from a large bag into small white packages. They wrap \u2018Teslas\u2019 and \u2018Trumps\u2019 \u2013 ecstasy tablets \u2013 in clingfilm. They don\u2019t store the drugs in their homes, but at a \u2018stash house\u2019. They pay the stasher for his services. \u201cOur batch is almost finished, so we\u2019re going to pick up some more from him in a minute.\u201d", "After their rendezvous with the stasher, two young blond women driving a VW Golf overtake the guys in front of a bakery on Bos en Lommerweg (\u201cThey sell white and brown here too.\u201d). Mo recognises one of them as a former customer and he shout out the window: \u201cNothing lasts! Everything will get fucked up! But then we will be here to help you!\u201d The ladies burst out laughing. Mo beams. \u201cMy heart is reserved for one person, but my dick is anyone\u2019s!\u201d", "Jamal and Mo don\u2019t sell hard drugs, they\u2019re very strict about that. By hard drugs they mean heroin and crack. Jamal: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be helping junkies fuck themselves up. Sure, some of our customers abuse drugs, but most of them use drugs. They like to party and they order once a week.\u201d They like to use too \u2013 a pill or a line now and then \u2013 but never while they\u2019re delivering. \u201cThe golden rule was and is: don\u2019t get high on your own supply.\u201d", "Some dealers do use while they\u2019re on the job, says a female customer, a successful entrepreneur. \u201cOnce, I let this guy in and he went straight to the bathroom for a snort and a crap.\u201d", "Our next destination is in the Jordaan neighbourhood. A smartly dressed man in his fifties orders a gram. \u201cIn the old days, going to the dealer was an outing. Sometimes a whole group of us would spend the entire weekend at the dealer\u2019s place doing blow (cocaine, ed.). These days you text them and they deliver it within half an hour. You hardly exchange a word with these scooter guys.\u201d", "Jamal admits it can be a lonely job sometimes. More than anything, it\u2019s just hard graft. \u201cI had a relationship with an amazing woman, she asked me to quit. I just couldn\u2019t. The money, the kicks \u2013 it\u2019s addictive. I\u2019ve bought myself a small home in Morocco and I\u2019m saving up. When I hit three million in three years\u2019 time, I\u2019ll stop. Then I\u2019ll settle down, I\u2019ll become a stay-at-home dad.\u201d", "He\u2019s not there yet, though. His phone rings. \u201cSure man, I\u2019m on my way.\u201d", "Jamal and Mo are fictitious names."], "authors": ["Sara Luijters"], "keywords": ["dont", "district", "hit", "stop", "amsterdam", "coke", "drugs", "car", "jamal", "ill", "million", "dealer", "week", "neighbourhood", "mo"], "pubDate": "2019-10-01T10:11:00Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
