He may even boycott Biden\u2019s inauguration ceremony.", "But even if Trump and his colleagues sow a sloppy, chaotic and vindictive transition of power, it\u2019s still unfathomable that the one-term president would belligerently barricade himself inside the Oval Office and refuse to leave, says Lawrence Douglas, a professor of law, jurisprudence and social thought at Amherst College.", "\u201cI do not see that happening,\u201d says Douglas, whose book Will He Go? considers the aftermath of the 2020 election. \u201cI think at some point, Donald Trump will submit to defeat.\u201d", "After Trump: first shots fired in battle for Republican party's future Read more", "After flirting with the idea of rejecting unfavorable election results for years, Trump has stoked fears of worst-case scenarios: civil war, a weaponized supreme court, and even the end to American democracy. With only 10% of Trump\u2019s supporters initially believing Biden won the presidential contest, many Americans are also concerned about an outburst of violence, even as the rancorous commander-in-chief paints a baseless picture of rigged, fraudulent results.", "\u201cI had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by. Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!\u201d Trump tweeted on Friday.", "In a last-ditch effort for Republicans to hold onto the executive branch, Trump and his allies have already begun filing a firestorm of lawsuits around the election. But they\u2019ve made little headway thus far.", "\u201cIf the number of contested ballots are not greater than the margin, courts are not eager to tear open an election,\u201d although judicial scrutiny could actually address a \u201clingering cloud of illegitimacy\u201d around the vote counts, said Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School.", "If any of Trump\u2019s legal challenges do find sympathy among Republican lawmakers and federal courts, that could cause a messy, fraught environment leading up to 20 January, when Biden is supposed to take office.", "But it\u2019s more probable that Republicans will remain silent even if Trump continues to fuss and largely refuses to cooperate with Biden\u2019s people in the interim, says Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University.", "\u201cThe difficulty with that is it just doesn\u2019t give the new administration the best tools, the best information, and the best transition that we would hope for,\u201d Zelizer says. But \u201cmy guess is Biden\u2019s already expecting that\u201d.", "Even as a lame duck, Trump could strategically force Democrats to oppose executive orders that underscore their party\u2019s vulnerabilities ahead of runoff elections in Georgia that will determine who controls the US Senate, Turley says. If the outgoing administration does lean on executive orders, those can be dismantled by Biden.", "But after Democrats spent four years challenging whether Trump could rescind former president Barack Obama\u2019s policies, Turley says, they\u2019ve created a \u201cprecedent of their own making\u201d against reversing such orders without long administrative slogs.", "Trump may use the power of the presidency to push for more conservative court appointments, another tax cut or environmental deregulations \u2013 measures to \u201cremind Republicans of why a lot of Republicans voted for him\u201d, says Zelizer, even as he exits the White House. Although he lost re-election, he still won more than 70m votes, and he could wield significant authority over his base for years to come.", "\u201cHe will continue to tell tens of millions of Americans that the Biden presidency is illegitimate, that essentially the Democrats have committed a coup,\u201d Douglas says. \u201cThat could certainly pave the way for a resurgence of Trumpism, if not Trump himself in 2024.\u201d", "Meanwhile, Biden may inherit a divided government that\u2019s struggled to cooperate and compromise in recent years, shaken by a tumultuous transition.", "\u201cHe\u2019s a decent person who genuinely will try to unite Americans,\u201d Douglas says. \u201cNow, whether he\u2019ll be successful at doing that remains to be seen.\u201d"], "authors": ["Alexandra Villarreal"], "keywords": ["push", "president", "douglas", "accept", "leave", "power", "yes", "house", "trump", "white", "republicans", "zelizer", "turley", "say", "election", "defeat", "biden", "experts"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
