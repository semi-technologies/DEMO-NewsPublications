We got to bust through some walls to make changes.\u201d [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] \u201c\u2014 is to rebuild our infrastructure. And here\u2019s what I think of Trump\u2019s wall.\u201d So awkward. Please play me more. What? Are you kidding me? It is chaotic. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s like you want to stop people from voting. This is, it\u2019s stupid. Ugh. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. That looks like an ink blot test. This looks like a toilet to me. It looks like a Jackson Pollock. That\u2019s straight-up Jackson Pollock. How do you pronounce that? I don\u2019t even know what that is. Gerrymandering? \u201cGerrymandering. The art of drawing districts to put as many of your voters together or more often, to make sure the other party\u2019s voters are broken up and scattered.\u201d Well, now when you tell me what gerrymandering is then this sounds like cheating. That\u2019s illegal. I\u2019m sorry, firstly, gerrymandering needs to be illegal. In Australia, redistricting is done by an independent commission, not done by the politicians who won those districts, so it is a lot fairer. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t registered to vote, time is running out.\u201d \u201cWith registration deadlines as far as 30 days before the election.\u201d What is voter registration? I mean, I know what it is, but I understand, why do you have this kind of thing? In Germany, you don\u2019t need to register yourself for the vote. In Estonia, voter registration is automatic. I actually had somebody who is an election officer come over to my house and help me out with my process of voter registration, and mind you, this is in a country of 1.3 billion people. \u201dVoter purging is the process by which election officials remove names from the voter rolls.\u201d Come on. No one thinks of a word \u201cpurge\u201d and thinks of anything positive. We have seen the \u201cPurge\u201d films. Georgia likely removed nearly 200,000 from voter rolls wrongfully? How? I can\u2019t imagine for this to happen in Germany. Nope, you don\u2019t get to vote. Nope, you don\u2019t get to vote either. Nope. \u201cVoting in America is on a Tuesday. Many people don\u2019t vote, because they are either too busy or have conflicting work or school schedules.\u201d To me, it sounds like 19th century to be honest. What I really appreciate about Germany is it\u2019s so easy for you to go and vote. It\u2019s on a Sunday. It\u2019s on a free day. In India, it\u2019s actually illegal to keep your employees from voting. So in Australia, we have this thing called a \u201cdemocracy sausage.\u201d You take a selfie with your democracy sausage. You haven\u2019t voted in Australia unless you\u2019ve gotten your democracy sausage. In the last Estonian parliamentary elections, I think I cast my vote during breakfast. I have this identity card. I insert it into a computer reader, pick my candidate, and cast my vote. It took me two minutes. Approximately a minute. Five minutes. Five to seven minutes. Five to 10. Ten minutes. \u201dSeven hours, 45 minutes, and 13 seconds it took for me.\u201d Wait, wait, wait, it took him the amount of time it will take for me to fly from the U.K., from London to New York. This feels like the opposite of easy to vote. This is not acceptable. It\u2019s just not acceptable in a democratic country, I think. I\u2019ll say 80 percent, just because they\u2019ve haven\u2019t been doing too well recently with everything else. 64 percent. Yeah, that\u2019s not good. That\u2019s almost half of the Americans have no voice. It\u2019s like you want to stop people from voting. Why is that so? \u201dSomebody please help us. We are at our polling place in Atlanta, Fickett Elementary School. The systems are down.\u201d \u201cOh look, there\u2019s no line. There\u2019s no line at all, out here in suburban white country.\u201d That\u2019s, for real that\u2019s the reason? Oh. That is the definition of racism. It\u2019s the same in South Africa. If you want to go into a wealthy white community, everything is easy. If you want to go to the township, I don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re going to get to vote. \u201cMoms and dads took their kids, you know, to vote with them doing the civil rights era. How I get to do that now? How I get to take my family with me, and I can go vote with family for the first time, and that means a lot to me.\u201d I think this is the sign of the resilience. That I think is what will protect democracy, if nothing else. But that American spirit, you have to love it. You know, people are still going out there and standing in the queues and standing in the rain. As weird as it sounds, the only way to overcome this is to vote. Fight to vote and then change the system by voting. I will never get up on American life. If people keep the same spirit, keep the same energy, then undoubtedly, a \u201cchange is gonna come.\u201d I think Americans should have a democracy sausage. Sure, call it a democracy hot dog if you want to. It tastes like freedom. Tastes like representative power."], "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo"], "keywords": ["voting", "thats", "dont", "voter", "democracy", "think", "know", "opinion", "minutes", "took", "2020", "vote"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
