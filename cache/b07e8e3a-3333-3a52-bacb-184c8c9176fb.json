(Eden).", "\u201cI have millions of memories of Larry,\u201d Eden recently told Closer Weekly. \u201cThe last time I saw him, I was in Australia and he was great. I\u2019ll never forget that. That was [several] years ago, before he passed away.

I told the wardrobe girl, \u2018You know, I can\u2019t wear that,\u2019 and she said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll go out and tell him.\u2019 So we went out and told Gene. Gene came back, looked at me and said: \u2018Barbara, you\u2019ve never been temperamental. You won\u2019t wear the bathing suit?\u2019 \u2026 I said, \u2018I\u2019m pregnant.\u2019 And he knew it. He said, \u2018Well, you can just wear it.\u2019 I said, \u2018No Gene, it doesn\u2019t look good. He said, \u2018Just put it on and let me see it.\u2019\"", "\"So I put the bathing suit on\u2026 he came to the door of my dressing room and I said, \u2018Ta-da!\u2019 And he went, \u2018Oh, OK, yeah.

We enjoyed working together\u2026 The most outstanding story with Larry was the one when we had a lion as a guest. I had done two feature films with lions and I\u2019ve been told how to treat them. They\u2019re male lions, they\u2019re lazy. If they\u2019re well-fed, they don\u2019t really want to eat you. But they do want to play with you if you run around! You have to be very quiet with them. So I went over and I told Larry, \u2018We have to go make friends with the lion.\u2019 He goes, \u2018I\u2019m not going to make any friends with any bleep lion!\u2019 And walks off!", "\u201cAnd so, I walked over and I did the usual things I\u2019ve been trained to do,\u201d Eden continued. \u201cI scratched him behind the ears. Never the ears, just behind the ears. And I rehearsed with the cat. He was 600 pounds, a big male lion. They put a little bowl of raw meat beside me. He put his head down and nom, nom, nom. Oh boy, that was good. He looks around and he\u2019s very happy. Very, very happy. And then Larry came in. They started the scene.", "\u201cThey put the meat down and he ate his meat. He turned around, looked at Larry, and let out a huge roar! It was the loudest roar you have ever heard in your life. Larry was on the next set. He was gone! But not only was he gone, but every single man on that set also ran. They broke the camera, one of the pieces fell over and I had a 600-pound lion on my lap purring. He put his head in my lap and started to lick my arm, like a great, big pussycat.\u201d", "'I DREAM OF JEANNIE' ACTRESS BARBARA EDEN DESCRIBES ACCIDENT ON SET: 'IT WAS AWFUL!'", "Eden also acknowledged that thanks to \u201cI Dream of Jeannie,\u201d she undoubtedly has one of the most famous bellybuttons in Hollywood history.", "\u201cI have a big 'thank-you' to the media for that,\u201d she said. \u201cI was on the set one day and [a writer] for The Hollywood Reporter walked on the set and right over to me. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t believe you have one.\u2019 I said, \u2018A what?\u2019 And he goes, \u2018A belly button!\u2019 And then he poked me in the middle! He started writing about my belly button... The next thing I knew, the 'Laugh-In' wanted to premiere my navel on NBC. I know a lot of women are known for very glamorous body parts, but my navel?
