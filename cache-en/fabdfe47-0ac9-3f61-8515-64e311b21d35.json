Their pretext was preventing the spread of the coronavirus. (As in many other countries, the pandemic has become an excuse for increased surveillance and control of the population.) Those at the headquarters, including me, were detained and interrogated; when we were released, police officers were stationed in front of our homes.", "The incident prompted my triumphant return to television. I watched, bewildered, as a cropped, edited image of me moved like a marionette through the propaganda tableau. There were parts of the video in which I was talking, but while those watching could see my lips move, they couldn\u2019t hear the cadence of my speech, how I always struggle for a few seconds to articulate an idea \u2014 those little nuances that are unique to me were erased. I was simply a cartoon villain.", "A college classmate of mine, L\u00e1zaro Manuel Alonso, was the host of one of the television programs on which the San Isidro movement and I were vilified. Mr. Alonso\u2019s betrayal is characteristic of totalitarian cultures. The task of conscientiously lying is perhaps the most unpleasant role to play in Cuban ideological theater.", "But to maintain Cubans\u2019 silence at all costs is a luxury that a regime like ours can no longer afford during an economic crisis deepened by the pandemic. The few shops with stocked shelves are the new government-run dollar stores, and Cubans must pay in a currency that they can obtain only through remittances at a time when renewed United States sanctions are cutting off those remittances.", "Watching myself be defamed on television made me think back to my childhood. Like all Cubans, I was once a \u201cpioneer,\u201d as patriotic children are called, and my neighbors looked upon me proudly because Castro had greeted me. Now the regime, acting as stage director, had assigned me the role of enemy of Cuba."], "authors": ["Carlos Manuel \u00c1lvarez"], "keywords": ["watching", "cubans", "pandemic", "television", "enemies", "regime", "officers", "opinion", "watched", "cuban", "villaina", "role", "vilified"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
