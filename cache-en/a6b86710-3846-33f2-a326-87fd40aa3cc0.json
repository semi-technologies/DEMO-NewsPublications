The final editing, fact-checking, and other work on the following week\u2019s issue\u2013\u2013the cover depicted domino pieces in a pattern resembling the novel coronavirus\u2013\u2013took place remotely. Over the next nine months, an unrelenting onslaught of news consumed the country\u2013\u2013and The New Yorker. As of this writing, the magazine\u2019s editorial staff has put out thirty-five print issues and published an additional three and a half million words online, all while collaborating day after day through squares on our laptop screens.", "To mark the end of this uniquely trying year, we are sharing a list of the most popular New Yorker pieces of the past twelve months. (Just as we did last year, we are using a metric that tracks what people read on their way to subscribing.) Piece by piece, the list encapsulates what we have endured. Carolyn Kormann\u2019s portrait of the novel coronavirus, published in late March, is the earliest pandemic-related article on it; others include Michael Specter\u2019s profile of Dr. Anthony Fauci, Charles Duhigg\u2019s investigation of the differing responses to early outbreaks in Seattle and New York, and two pieces by Atul Gawande on how to manage the spread of the disease.", "The list also reflects dramatic events that weren\u2019t directly connected to the pandemic. During the racial-justice protests that roiled the country over the summer, James Baldwin\u2019s classic \u201cLetter from a Region in My Mind,\u201d first published in 1962, found a new generation of readers. A more recent piece from the magazine\u2019s archives, Dexter Filkins\u2019s 2013 profile of Qassem Suleimani, the Iranian intelligence commander, made the list after Suleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike, in January.", "This year\u2019s Presidential election unfolded like none other in American history. Jane Mayer\u2019s examination of Mitch McConnell\u2019s alliance with Donald Trump topped the list, followed by her piece detailing more than a dozen investigations and civil lawsuits that await the President after he leaves office. Mayer\u2019s third piece in the top twenty-five focussed on the sexual-harassment allegations against Kimberly Guilfoyle that led to her departure from Fox News. This year also marked the first Presidential election in which The New Yorker\u2019s Web site hosted a live results map, which made the top five. Another reader favorite: Lizzie Widdicombe\u2019s piece from before the vote, which dropped in on a Zoom training session about how to beat an election-related power grab. In a piece that revisited a previous, less frightening epoch in American politics, President Obama published an excerpt of his latest memoir, \u201cA Promised Land,\u201d in The New Yorker, detailing his bruising battle to reform health care.", "In the midst of so many travails, and with readers mostly stuck at home, it\u2019s clear that many were looking for diversion. Richard Brody\u2019s list of the forty best movies on Netflix made the top ten, as did Michael Schulman\u2019s interview with Fran Lebowitz, the \u201cpatron saint of staying at home and doing nothing.\u201d A satirical piece on the list, by Andy Borowitz, reported that Fauci recommended administering alcohol to survive the White House\u2019s coronavirus briefings.", "Over the past year, the magazine published a series of pieces on the future of American democracy, beginning with an essay by Jill Lepore, published in January, which looked back at America in the nineteen-thirties, another period of great anxiety about the fragility of democratic institutions. At year\u2019s end\u2014with Trump still refusing to concede the election, and as the country begins the long process of recovering from his Presidency\u2014her admonition still resonates: \u201cDon\u2019t ask whether you need an umbrella. Go outside and stop the rain.\u201d", "I hope that you enjoy each of these pieces\u2014and that, if you\u2019re not already a subscriber, you\u2019ll consider becoming one and supporting our journalism.", "The Senate Majority Leader\u2019s refusal to rein in the President is looking riskier than ever.", "The President has survived one impeachment, twenty-six accusations of sexual misconduct, and an estimated four thousand lawsuits.
