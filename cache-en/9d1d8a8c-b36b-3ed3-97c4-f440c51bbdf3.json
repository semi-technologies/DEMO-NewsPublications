While numerous books have since been published about Lennon's heinous death, Kenneth Womack was determined to take a closer look at the final days of his life.", "The author\u2019s new book, \u201cJohn Lennon 1980,\u201d examines how Lennon rediscovered himself as an artist and was enjoying his home life with his wife Yoko Ono and their son Sean Ono Lennon.", "After releasing \u201cDouble Fantasy\u201d in November of that year, he was poised to hit the road and create more music. Womack told Fox News he reached out to those who collaborated with Lennon in 1980 to paint a portrait of a bright life that was tragically dimmed.", "ROCK PHOTOGRAPHER BOB GRUEN RECALLS JOHN LENNON, SID VICIOUS: 'I HAD SO MUCH FUN ALONG THE WAY'", "\u201cI loved learning about how creative John was feeling at this point in his life,\u201d Womack explained. \u201cYou could almost feel this change happening in him as you study his material. And that change moved into other parts of his life, such as his life with Yoko and their son.", "\u201cYou can feel this positive emotion during this year,\u201d Womack continued. \u201cIt was really heartwarming. Even on the last days of his life, John was so excited about what he was doing and how fully involved he was in his music. He was thrilled to help Yoko with her own music and was proud to be a good husband to her. He wanted to be a great cheerleader for her as she was to him. He was also a doting father to Sean, an experience he greatly enjoyed.\"", "Womack shared that previously, Lennon faced insecurity in stepping out on his own. The Beatles took Britain by storm in 1963 before \u201cBeatlemania\u201d spread to the United States in 1964, History.com noted. The group sold millions of records before they disbanded in 1970.", "According to the outlet, Lennon put music on hold in 1975 to focus on his home life with Ono, now 87, as well as their son. It wouldn\u2019t be until 1980 when Lennon made a comeback with \u201cDouble Fantasy,\u201d a celebrated album that paid homage to his love for the Japanese artist.", "PAUL MCCARTNEY RECALLS SEEING JOHN LENNON FOR THE FIRST TIME BEFORE BEATLES FAME", "Lennon and Ono married in 1969. That union lasted until his death.", "\u201cJohn even has a song called \u2018I\u2019m Stepping Out,\u2019\u201d said Womack. \u201cIf we study his music, we can really see him having, using his own words, stepping out. The music industry had changed since his so-called retirement. You\u2019ve got punk and disco. John knew he really wanted to get it right on his own terms. So you really see this focus, this determination for John to say, \u2018Hey world, this is me.'\u201d", "The British artist was also experiencing a different kind of love -- with New York City.", "\u201cHe loved New York,\u201d said Womack. \u201cHe wanted to be in this place that was the starting point and ending point to so many journeys. He was attracted to what felt like a kind of anonymity where he could be around people and have private experiences in the city. That appealed to him greatly.", "PAUL MCCARTNEY SAYS HE WAS \u2018HURTING TOO MUCH\u2019 TO KEEP THE BEATLES GOING AFTER JOHN LENNON LEFT", "\u201cSomebody would occasionally ask for an autograph or simply wave hello,\u201d Womack continued. \u201cBut at the same time, he could be at a restaurant or wander into Central Park and no one would pay attention. He liked the energy that New York City offered, but also the kind of access to privacy that he couldn\u2019t find elsewhere.\u201d", "Womack said that many fans still believe that Lennon and former bandmate Paul McCartney weren\u2019t on speaking terms after the Beatles broke up. However, he said that\u2019s far from the truth.", "\u201cThey were certainly at a place where they weren\u2019t afraid to pick up the phone and call each other,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd they would do just that on several occasions. They really seemed to have reached a nice spot in their relationship. John would follow Paul\u2019s music and really admire the fact that his former partner was taking chances and doing something different and interesting. We also see John referring to Paul very often in a very positive light. At one point, he would say, \u2018my dear one.\u2019", "\u201cEven on the last afternoon of his life, when talking to his sound crew, John was asked about Paul. He said, \u2018I would do anything for him. And I believe he would do anything for me. We care deeply about each other,\u2019\u201d Womack revealed. \u201cTheir friendship was extraordinary and it showed.\u201d", "PAUL MCCARTNEY REVEALS HE 'DREAMS' ABOUT THE LATE JOHN LENNON: 'THEY'RE ALWAYS GOOD'", "Mark David Chapman, who killed Lennon just hours after the singer autographed his album, was denied parole for the 11th time in August of this year.

Look at this, he signed it, just go home.\u2019 But there was no way I was just going to go home.\u201d", "Chapman\u2019s next parole hearing is scheduled for August, 2022.", "JOHN LENNON'S KILLER, MARK DAVID CHAPMAN, DENIED PAROLE FOR 11TH TIME", "Womack said he purposely omitted Chapman\u2019s name from his book because it aims to focus on Lennon\u2019s life -- not the way he died.", "Womack does hope his book will shine a spotlight on Lennon\u2019s positive outlook on a life cut short.", "\u201cIt\u2019s an inspiring story of what\u2019s it like to come back, fight your demons and pursue your passions,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope readers experience the same kind of momentum John experienced as he was working on his music and being on top of his game. It was an exciting journey for me. I know it was thrilling for John and I hope readers can experience that, too.\u201d", "The Associated Press contributed to this report."], "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "keywords": ["feel", "music", "lennons", "final", "emotion", "days", "womack", "really", "life", "parole", "ono", "thrived", "point", "positive", "lennon", "book", "john", "mccartney"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
