New sensors help machines to be more accurate sight, hear sounds, and understand location. Powerful processors can help computers make complex decisions, sort through possibilities, plan outcomes, and learn from mistakes. The possibilities are thrilling; the implications are vast.", "The field of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) includes a collection of tools, techniques and methods that are of relevance to today\u2019s corporate managers. These techniques help to support decision-making in this VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) world. The techniques combine the best of the statistics and computer science world to solve the real world corporate problems. It is all about analyzing data with a lens that is unique and provide useful insights. ML and AI techniques such as ANNs, Genetic Algorithms and Decision Trees are now widely used in data mining and analytics fields.
