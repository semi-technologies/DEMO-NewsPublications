Where is the science on masks? I'm not saying don't wear a mask. I'm not being anti-mask by any means. I'm anti-mask-mandate. I will admit that. We've been wearing masks for a long time. Look at areas of the country where people are wearing masks religiously and then look at other areas of the country, maybe up where I'm at, where there aren't quite as much. There's no difference. People are still getting it or they're not getting it. And honestly, I got to tell you right up front, I don't even know what the numbers mean anymore, because I think that it doesn't matter what you die from nowadays, it gets categorized as a COVID death. I mean, you could get run over by a dump truck twenty minutes from now, and someone's going to put COVID on your death certificate or on your hospital discharge paperwork. It's crazy. So I tell you, I don't know what it is, but it's part of this political push to create a certain amount of angst and fear.\""], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["congressmanelect", "takes", "science", "wear", "bidens", "saying", "dont", "jackson", "masks", "hundredday", "im", "wearing", "ronny", "mask", "mean", "plan", "tell"], "pubDate": "2020-12-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
