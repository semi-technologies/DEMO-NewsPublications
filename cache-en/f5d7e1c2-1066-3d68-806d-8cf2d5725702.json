It\u2019s her willingness to embrace a heady mix of genres that makes ALIAS so thrilling, as it drifts from the frantic UK garage beats of \u201cTASTY,\u201d to the itchy, glitchy videogame synths and grime-adjacent flow of \u201cLENG,\u201d to the four-to-the-floor thump and fizzy Europop whistles of \u201cSIREN.\u201d Her Instagram bio reads \u201cLYRICALLY SEXXXY 24/7\u201d, a claim her soft-spoken, nonchalant vocals more than live up to. \u201cI'm a freak in the sheets, and I go the whole night / I hear they call me shy, I can only wonder why,\u201d she hisses on one of the EP\u2019s standout, \u201cFREAK,\u201d made with her regular collaborator, the similarly buzzy London producer Sega Bodega. And even as she firmly marks her own territory as an artist, any attempts to box her into specific genres feels futile. It\u2019s hard not to be reminded of the rich seam of Black female musicians who have pushed against the boundaries of the genres expected of them\u2014from Janet Jackson to Kelis to FKA Twigs\u2014yet whose narratives have been forced to fit awkwardly into the confines of R&B, even while they moved between a wildly eclectic range of sonic palettes.", "But with her various alter-egos and wilfully experimental sound, Shygirl is clearly ensuring she\u2019s one step ahead of any attempts to neatly define her. \u201cWhen I was considering bringing all these different sides of myself to the project and trying to explain it to myself, I was like, how can I be all these things at once?\u201d she says of ALIAS. One way of expressing this came via a series of 3D avatars Shygirl created\u2014coming to life as something between Bratz dolls and Y2K-era videogame characters\u2014with the help of CG artist Sy Blake and animator Maurice Andresen. \u201cThere\u2019s this weird thing when I\u2019m using myself as the muse,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of self-gratification that\u2019s almost childlike, and making myself into a video game character is what I would have dreamed about doing as a kid. It was just a lot easier to try and personify those alter-egos, and I wanted to have a visual representation to help explain that. Because I do become those people, depending on what I decide to wear any given day.\u201d", "If there\u2019s another thing Shygirl knows, it\u2019s what to wear on any given day, as she herself puts it. It doesn\u2019t take more than a cursory scroll through her Instagram feed to see that Shygirl is firmly embedded in the current crop of agenda-setting designers emerging from London, all of whom helped define the various characters on ALIAS. There\u2019s her longstanding friendship with Mowalola Ogunlesi, whose designs outfitted Bonk; her love for ASAI\u2019s signature \u201chot wok\u201d mesh tops, here worn by Bae; and of course Bovine\u2019s relationship with Charlotte Knowles, whose fall campaign she appeared in wearing one of the designer\u2019s signature tattoo prints."], "authors": ["Liam Hess", "Liam Hes"], "keywords": ["theres", "rapper", "videogame", "wear", "londons", "stylish", "various", "thing", "faces", "artist", "shygirl", "breakout", "genres", "alias", "signature"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
