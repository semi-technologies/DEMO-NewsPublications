In one case, detainees were allegedly put under showers and then tasered by ICE agents, leaving some in need of hospital care.", "The deportations are taking place despite a finding last year by the US government that the Cameroon government \u201cengages in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights\u201d.

It describes itself as a non-violent group but he said many of his fellow members had been killed or imprisoned, in the counter-insurgency the government is waging against anglophone separatists. He said he was sent a photograph of his brother\u2019s body while he was in detention.", "Daniel said he was detained and tortured in 2014, and then arrested again in 2017, but he bribed his way out of prison and fled the country, eventually finding his way, after a transatlantic flight and a gruelling, dangerous trek across South and Central America to the US-Mexican border. He has been in US detention ever since.", "\u201cFor us you have always been a country of freedom, who looked after vulnerable people,\u201d Daniel said, referring to the US. \u201cThere is an active war happening in Cameroon, and I don\u2019t think it is American values just to send people back to be killed\u201d.", "Van Hollen, Democratic senator for Maryland, wrote to the acting DHS director Chad Wolf, on 6 November pointing out that violence in Cameroon is escalating.", "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously alarming that they would schedule these flights given the violence in Cameroon, and the very high risk that anybody deported to Cameroon would become the victim of violence,\u201d he told the Guardian.", "\u201cWe are bringing this to their [DHS\u2019s] attention so they are not going to be able to plead ignorance.\u201d", "The senator said his letter to the DHS director that many of the 57 Cameroonians deported on a ICE flight on 13 October, \u201cnow live in hiding for fear for their lives, or have not been heard of since leaving the US.\u201d", "According to a news report from Cameroon, the returnees were detained by government security forces after their flight arrived in Douala and their whereabouts are now unknown.

My genitals were completely naked and exposed. I was naked in front of many people \u2013 there were over 10 people there, including the women,\u201d BN said. \u201cI felt ashamed.\u201d", "In separate complaints, the Immigrants Rights Clinic at the Texas A&M School of Law, cited abuses at the Adams County Correctional Centre in Mississippi. An Angolan inmate identified as AC, also due to be on the Tuesday flight, said his fingerprint was taken by force and he witnessed the torture of other detainees at the prison\u2019s solitary facility, the security housing unit (SHU).", "\u201cDuring his time there, he saw ICE bring African detainees to the SHU, put them in the shower, get them soaking wet, and then they use the \u2018electric pistols\u2019 (tasers) on them until they passed out,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cHe was terrified that they would do this to him, which is why he eventually gave in when he was being physically abused and signed and gave his fingerprints.\u201d", "\u201cWe know that many of the people who are at risk of deportation have been abused in ICE custody, particularly in the jurisdiction of the New Orleans field office,\u201d Fatma Marouf, the director of the clinic, said, adding the deportees were terrified of what awaited them after Tuesday\u2019s flight.", "\u201cI think the risk to the Cameroonians is very serious,\u201d Marouf said. \u201cMany of them were beaten by the military before as they were part of separatist movements. Some of them were leaders in their communities. I think they really do fear for their lives going back.\u201d", "Immigrant rights organisations say there has been a rush in recent weeks to deport African asylum seekers in particular.", "\u201cThis is consistent with the way the Trump administration is trying to rush many decisions in these closing weeks of the administration,\u201d Van Hollen said, pointing to eleventh-hour steps to erase environmental regulations, and politicise the civil service. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing from the Trump administration in their dining hours is a rush to do as much damage as possible.\u201d"], "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "keywords": ["flight", "violence", "rights", "deportees", "despite", "way", "trump", "death", "warnings", "send", "deportation", "cameroon", "seekers", "asylum", "detainees", "plane", "ice"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
