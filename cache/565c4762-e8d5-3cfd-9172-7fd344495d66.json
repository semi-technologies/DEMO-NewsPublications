Those trying to manage their daily news-bingeing couldn\u2019t have known in advance to budget hours for both of these unnerving events.

I just want the information, not to be the author or be forced to see through his or her eyes.\u201d Even \u201cThe Ethics of Ambiguity,\u201d by Simone de Beauvoir, and Immanuel Kant\u2019s \u201cCritique of Pure Reason\u201d have been boiled down into bullet points, a SparkNotes for high-functioning grownups.

Recent projects included two books about the Harvey Weinstein trial; \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly; and \u201cShe Comes First,\u201d an instructional treatise on female orgasm by Dr. Ian Kerner.", "The company had considered Blinking the Mueller report and decided that the task was too difficult, but it had a go at Maxwell\u2019s testimony. Erik Niklasson, the company\u2019s content producer, said, \u201cSometimes we do very abstract books. Our tone is hand-holding, like: Bear with us, this gets a bit complicated. We use repetition and disclaimers. And context is so important.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t get cultural references sometimes. I\u2019m from Sweden.\u201d", "\u201cOur star writer found this pretty tough,\u201d Thomas Anderson, the company\u2019s head of English content, said of the Maxwell transcript. \u201cCompared with a nonfiction book, there isn\u2019t too much concrete information in there.\u201d Despite the salacious nature of the case, he said, the key insights are \u201ca bit bland.\u201d The Blinkist summation makes no mention of a basket of sex toys, a detail that other news accounts of the deposition highlight.", "Here\u2019s a Blinked version of the Blinkist distillation: \u201cThe first key insight is: Ghislaine Maxwell claims that Virginia Giuffre is a liar. \u2018Lies,\u2019 \u2018liar,\u2019 \u2018lied,\u2019 \u2018lying\u2019\u2014the words appear again and again throughout the deposition.

The plot as the soul of the work, the component that gives it its integrity and wholeness. Plato didn\u2019t seem to understand this. He probably wondered, Is Homer writing about how to drive a chariot? Or how to slaughter an ox? Aristotle says the poet knows how to make a plot.\u201d", "Arac went on, \u201cWe choose to have someone else do it for us because we assume this is an experience we don\u2019t have time for.\u201d In the nineteenth century, he noted, Edgar Allan Poe argued that modern life was so busy that the short story was the right form for it.", "A new app, Instaread, condenses fiction titles: one can experience \u201cThe Fountainhead,\u201d \u201c1984,\u201d or Jonathan Franzen\u2019s latest, \u201cPurity\u201d (which clocks in at five hundred and sixty-three pages), as a twenty-six-minute audio summary.
