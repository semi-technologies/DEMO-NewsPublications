He responded that the comparison was apt: \u201cReinhart said he was turning the light out on painting. But if you\u2019re going to be at the edge of visibility, you\u2019ve gotta put all the information in there. The reality is that even when the lights are off, everything that was in the world is still there. You have to put it in there so that if people actually look hard, they can see it. The point is to show that blackness is rich and complex, within the blackness alone.\u201d", "To get this, Marshall begins with three different shades\u2014carbon black; iron oxide black, also called mars black; and ivory black, also called bone black\u2014and then adds cobalt blue, chrome green, carbazole dioxazine violet, yellow ochre, and raw sienna. \u201cThe color comes up when you stack them on top of each other,\u201d he says. Marshall texted me the final image mid-July, and at first I could barely see the features of her face. But as we talked, they emerged, gradually and indelibly. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be painting a face as black as I\u2019m painting them, they can\u2019t just be a cipher, like a black hole. They have to be mysterious but available,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you say, \u2018Black is beautiful,\u2019 you have to show it. And what I\u2019m doing is showing it at the extreme. Yes, it is black\u2014very black\u2014and it is very beautiful.\u201d"], "authors": ["Dodie Kazanjian", "Dodie Kazanjia"], "keywords": ["vogues", "youre", "face", "2020", "edge", "painting", "im", "called", "going", "covers", "marshall", "black", "making", "issue", "visibility"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
