What was so great about him? The anthropologist Aleksandar Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 wrote, in 2003, that \u201cthere is perhaps no single figure that influenced so strongly French ethnology and anthropology.\u201d This is one Leiris. But, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 wrote, Leiris was also an \u201cartist, poet, writer, critic, traveller, surrealist . . . a true \u2018Renaissance Man\u2019 whose friends included Breton, Bataille, Giacometti, Picasso, C\u00e9saire, and M\u00e9traux.\u201d This gets us closer.", "Leiris was, before anything, a tireless witness to lived experience. The term he preferred for most of his work was not \u201cmemoir\u201d but \u201cautobiographical essay,\u201d and he applied the rigor of an objective observer to his recording of the subjective. Born in 1901, he worked steadily for seven decades, but his books have yet to secure a spot with most Anglophone readers. At least five of the translated Leiris volumes are indispensable. These include two recent English editions, whose late appearance helps explain the low profile: the 2019 Semiotext(e) edition of \u201cThe Ribbon at Olympia\u2019s Throat,\u201d which was first published in 1981, and \u201cPhantom Africa,\u201d published by Seagull Books, in 2019, eighty-five years after it was released in French. \u201cThe Rules of the Game,\u201d an autobiography published in four volumes, between 1948 and 1976, is Leiris\u2019s longest and most essential work, glacially slow and furiously alive. I can\u2019t vouch for the fourth and final book, \u201cFr\u00eale Bruit,\u201d because it hasn\u2019t yet appeared in English, but the first three volumes\u2014\u201cScratches,\u201d \u201cScraps,\u201d and \u201cFibrils,\u201d as translated by Lydia Davis\u2014are among the most astonishing books I\u2019ve read.", "2020 in Review New Yorker writers reflect on the year\u2019s highs and lows.", "Leiris was a shy and flinty nonbeliever, who valued exactitude above all and who wrote nested, page-long sentences to create \u201ca series of screens\u201d between himself and his ideas. He escaped calcification by holding fast to his curiosity and built ethical strength by observing the slow boil of his consciousness. By the nineteen-fifties, he was firmly anti-colonialist, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist. In 1976, when he was seventy-four, he wrote that his core themes were \u201can aspiration to the marvellous, a desire to commit himself to the struggle against the flagrant injustices of society, a desire for universalism which has led him to have direct contacts with cultures other than his own.\u201d In 2020, he was a delightful companion.", "Leiris stumbled onto his themes. As a university student, he flirted with jazz and chemistry, before graduating with a degree in philosophy. He spent the next few years working in Paris, and by 1929 he had married, gained renown as a poet, and joined then broken with the Surrealist movement. (He remained committed to the \u201cbroadly defined psychological and social liberation\u201d that Surrealism espoused.) That year, he became an editor for Georges Bataille\u2019s Documents, a heterodox magazine that served as a workshop for writers floating through and away from the Surrealist epicenter. According to one front cover, the magazine was dedicated to \u201cdoctrines, archaeology, fine arts, and ethnography.\u201d Ethnography was then a barely defined field in France, but its promise caught Leiris\u2019s attention. Eager to get out of Europe, he agreed, in 1931, to be the \u201csecretary-archivist\u201d for a two-year expedition, organized by the anthropologist Marcel Griaule, across sub-Saharan Africa.", "Leiris\u2019s account of that trip, \u201cPhantom Africa,\u201d would be his first great work. Leiris did not approach what he called the \u201cfortuitous circumstance\u201d of his journey as a traditional ethnographer, partly because he had no training in the field. Instead, he kept a diary and\u2014according to Brent Hayes Edwards, who translated the new edition\u2014\u201cwas adamant that, aside from minor corrections,\u201d the entries \u201cwere not revised after the fact.\u201d The result is more than six hundred pages of journal entries, which recount dreams, the behavior of soldiers, a variety of conflicts with Griaule, erotic projections, aches, other aches, and a running measure of his distance from both the people he was studying and the people who had sent him to do the studying. (The first English translation, by Robin Chancellor, was abandoned after the book\u2019s publisher demanded extensive cuts to what he called \u201cschoolboys\u2019 lavatory wall dirt.\u201d Leiris did not agree to the cuts.) On the trip, Leiris used file cards to document the items his group would take to France. For the rest of his life, he would use the same method to organize ideas for his books.", "Leiris wrote that \u201cPhantom Africa\u201d was the aggregate of \u201cwhat would result when I forced myself to record virtually everything that happened around me and everything that went through my head.\u201d One can sense the autobiographer taking shape in these lines, but Leiris also found room, in his mind, to make an argument about ethnography. \u201cPhantom Africa\u201d confounded the field\u2019s claims to objectivity by pointing out that the ethnographer is often just recording himself. There was a challenge, too, in the book\u2019s explicit political critique. In his entries, Leiris questioned the validity of the French colonial mind-set and, more specifically, the moral implications of collecting so much butin (booty) for French museums. (Some of the butin that Leiris described is now being considered by Emmanuel Macron for restitution.) After the book came out, in 1934, Griaule and Leiris had a falling out. Five years later, in an unsent letter written to Bataille, Leiris was still warning against the \u201cimposition of our European casts of mind upon the facts\u201d of ethnography. \u201cHowever intensely we imagined living the experience of the native person,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe cannot enter his skin, and it is always our own experience that we live.\u201d", "Most Americans first encountered a Leiris who had little to do with ethnography. In 1939, Leiris published \u201cManhood,\u201d a memoir that he\u2019d begun writing before his trip with Griaule. More than two decades later, Susan Sontag reviewed Richard Howard\u2019s English translation for The New York Review of Books. Her oft-quoted opening is \u201cPlunked down in translation in the year 1963, Michel Leiris\u2019s brilliant and repulsive autobiographical narrative L\u2019Age d\u2019Homme, is at first rather puzzling.\u201d (The essay became the foreword for a later edition of the book, the word \u201crepulsive\u201d subtracted.) Sontag reads Leiris\u2019s honesty as \u201can especially powerful instance of the venerable preoccupation with sincerity peculiar to French letters.\u201d This interpretation leads to mention of Montaigne, a common move in Leiris criticism, though Montaigne was generally more concerned with coming off well. Not so Leiris, who opens \u201cManhood\u201d with a slow, disgusted X-ray of himself. \u201cI loathe unexpectedly catching sight of myself in a mirror, for unless I have prepared myself for the confrontation, I seem humiliatingly ugly to myself each time,\u201d he writes.", "For Leiris, even self-esteem is suspect, another trap between you and experience. In 1946, in an afterword to \u201cManhood,\u201d Leiris wrote that the book was \u201cthe negation of a novel.\u201d \u201cIn it,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI set out mainly to condense, almost in the rough, an ensemble of images and facts that I refused to exploit by allowing my imagination to work on them.\u201d Even if Sontag\u2019s response was partly disparaging\u2014\u201cThe book has no movement or direction,\u201d she wrote, and \u201cprovides no consummation or climax\u201d\u2014she did see Leiris\u2019s broader project clearly. \u201cManhood is another of those very modern books which are fully intelligible only as part of the project of a life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA book,\u201d in other words, \u201cis an action, giving on to other actions.\u201d", "\u201cManhood\u201d was absolutely part of that project, but it may not have been the most felicitous way to introduce Anglophone readers to Leiris. The \u201cimpassioned frankness\u201d that Leiris longed for is muddled by an atypical focus on the narcissistic injuries of his early years. But there was more to come. In his mid-thirties, Leiris began the decades-long autobiographical study that became \u201cThe Rules of the Game.\u201d The first volume, \u201cScratches,\u201d appeared in 1948. Like \u201cManhood,\u201d the book was an \u201caction,\u201d but Leiris seemed to have changed his relationship to language. According to Davis\u2019s introduction, Leiris said that he could \u201cscarcely see the literary use of speech as anything but a means of sharpening one\u2019s consciousness in order to be more\u2014and in a better way\u2014alive.\u201d His sentences had blossomed into a new variant, which held the reader close and pushed time into the background. Leiris had found the music of his consciousness, and it obeyed a slow, searching tempo.", "\u201cScratches\u201d begins with Leiris\u2019s earliest memories, of carpet patterns and lead soldiers and alphabet books. He pairs the associative logic of Documents with the mode of Proust and, affixing one idea to another and another, lets both run to the pulse of memory. This accretive pace, a ball of gum rolling through the senses, means that his memory of his father\u2019s phonograph begins with the word \u201cPersephone\u201d and takes dozens of pages to unfold. \u201cPersephone\u201d leads to \u201cgramophone\u201d and then to \u201cdiaphragm,\u201d which leads to an examination of the \u201cslightly fatty quality\u201d of the surface noise heard when the grooves of a wax cylinder are traced by a needle and amplified through a metal horn, creating a \u201ctempest in a teapot (or even in a cup for mixing watercolors), a seismic tremor racking the thickness of a crystal lens.\u201d Davis, who translated much of \u201cThe Rules of the Game,\u201d told me that she \u201cdelighted in reconstructing the complex syntax\u201d of such sentences, and that \u201cLeiris\u2019s style is, if anything, even more convoluted or complex than Proust\u2019s.\u201d Davis has described both Leiris and Proust as using a \u201chypotactic structure,\u201d with many subordinate clauses, and the poet Jean Laude called Leiris\u2019s method \u201cfugal,\u201d in conversation with itself. These are accurate summations, but it remains hard to capture, in a comprehensive way, what was a new mode for Leiris, a long and loose cadence that allowed his writing to embody his thinking.", "In 1981, five years after \u201cFr\u00eale Bruit,\u201d the final volume of \u201cThe Rules of the Game,\u201d came out, Leiris published \u201cThe Ribbon at Olympia\u2019s Throat,\u201d which has been newly translated by Christine Pichini. Less a coda to his masterwork than its continuation, \u201cThe Ribbon at Olympia\u2019s Throat\u201d is perhaps the best introduction to Leiris, his interests, and the curve of his rhythms. If skepticism is central to his project, you see it here, at the level of the sentence, where his subordinate clauses delay and delay, pushing the point away from you as you read.", "This book is a memoir, again, with an oddly specific orientation. One axis is a series of twenty-five observations about \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s painting \u201cOlympia,\u201d which features a nude white woman, her neck ringed with black ribbon, being brought flowers by a clothed Black servant. Leiris doesn\u2019t interpret the painting so much as study himself in its presence. The other axis is a chain of observations, each a digression from the last, about Leiris\u2019s neighborhood. Two young women in a sports car are trying to pick him up (he hopes), a beggar argues with him, and the trees near his house are \u201cso high, so straight and so close together that inside them not a sound is heard, as if they had placed sound outside of our reach while soaring\u2014fearless\u2014towards the sky and pushing sound up, out of the compact mass of the highest branches, towards a space of quarantine.\u201d", "\u201cOlympia\u201d is the ribbon that ties the book together. Leiris\u2019s father told the writer that Manet had painted a \u201clifeless figure whose formal stiffness was as repellent as her almost cadaverous complexion.\u201d Leiris disagreed. He believed that the \u201cribbon and other accessories only emphasize her nudity,\u201d and that the ribbon itself is \u201cthe unnecessary detail that hooks us and makes Olympia real.\u201d This fetishistic attention is the central subject of the book. For Leiris, the ribbon is \u201cthe rope that keeps me from foundering.\u201d He keeps looking for ways to connect events to totems, \u201ca detail to use as a lever, like the ribbon.\u201d", "Because the crucial detail could lie anywhere, waiting to be uncovered, Leiris tends not to weight his experiences differently. Each event is presented as equally animated or blank, and the smallest experiences are some of the richest. \u201cWhile smoking a cigarette and drinking tea in my bedroom in Paris, the desire often strikes me\u2014irrational but acutely felt\u2014to smoke a cigarette,\u201d Leiris writes. \u201cBut I am already smoking, and thus it is absurd to wish to do something that, quite simply, I\u2019m in the middle of doing.\u201d At one point, Leiris argues with himself for seven pages about how to describe and interpret sunlight in the Black Forest: \u201cLimpid patches somehow transforming the terrestrial landscape into a kind of negative of the celestial landscape, which itself was stained by fat, dark clouds.\u201d Eventually, after ruminating on writing, death, and opera, he turns the lens back to himself, claiming to be a failure\u2014\u201cthe preoccupied snob and unquiet man I have always been\u201d\u2014just as he succeeds. \u201cWhile we\u2019re in the thick of it, we would like the book, a tossed pebble, to make some waves,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut, whatever acclaim it may receive, the party will already be over, the spell already broken.\u201d", "In \u201cScratches,\u201d Leiris wrote that he felt an \u201cirrational repugnance at the idea of going straight to the point.\u201d Several decades later, in 1987, three years before his death and after all of his books had been written, he said that \u201ca person in our day and age who has self-respect owes it to himself to be as lucid as he can possibly be.\u201d These ideas, seemingly at odds, are, in fact, two sides of the same belief\u2014that language, properly engaged, can reveal the holy glint of experience. For Leiris, it could also provide something like an ethics. He loved the sounds of words, their accidental commonalities, the fellowship found within a family of writers, and the house of the sentence itself, which, if built properly, contains both what has happened to us and how we\u2019ve perceived it, at the exact same time, again and again.", "2020 in Review"], "authors": ["Sasha Frere-Jones", "Sasha Frere-Jone", "Jennifer Wilso"], "keywords": ["saw", "leiriss", "wrote", "books", "ribbon", "french", "manhood", "man", "translated", "leiris", "book", "published"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
