How much of an impact did that have on you?", "Nicole Trunfio: I went from shooting a cover as I would for any job to appearing on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d to talk about it *laughs*. I remember people were just like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d", "In Australia, we breastfeed in public all the time and it\u2019s really not a big deal. I remember my husband wasn\u2019t aware of that. It was kind of frowned upon in Texas [where we live], a conservative state. So when the cover came out, I was just blown away by the number of people that were approaching me and thanking me for bringing this to light.", "It was strange because I thought it was normal. My son was hungry and I fed him as any mother would. I didn\u2019t understand the controversy. This is lifesaving. And I\u2019m glad that it has become more normalized since then. Initially, I just thought it was any other cover. But when the magazine came out, I remember I woke up that morning and I had tens of thousands of new followers. And then the cover went viral.

And he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat do you mean, what am I doing? What am I going to do, go into the bathroom and sit on a toilet seat to feed my baby?\u201d It\u2019s so gross. Of course, I don\u2019t want to be stared at while I\u2019m feeding my son.

This is a necessary thing to do. It should be normal, just as it is normal to feed your baby with a bottle. It\u2019s all life-giving. But I\u2019m glad that so many women were grateful to see that because breastfeeding should be normalized. I\u2019m proud of being a mother.

What\u2019s it been like having a baby during a pandemic?", "Trunfio: It\u2019s actually been really great. It\u2019s been nice to take a step back and enjoy just spending time with each other.
