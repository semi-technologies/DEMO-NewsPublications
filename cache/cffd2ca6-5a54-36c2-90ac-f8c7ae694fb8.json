This litany inevitably ends with a gripe that Europe needs to do much more to foster such companies at home.", "Europe\u2019s version of techlash often looks like sour grapes. With the possible exception of Spotify, no internet firm successful enough for regulators to worry about was founded there (and the Swedish music-streaming business is listed in New York). SAP , a German software-maker, is big but hails from the pre-internet era. Unicorns, worth $1bn-plus, remain as rare on the old continent as the term suggests they ought to be.

Even privacy worries, long a European preserve, are infecting America.", "As with many American efforts to regulate Big Tech, EU ones are a work in progress. A copyright law designed to make search engines pay publishers (such as news organisations) for snippets became practically useless after Google last month said it would tweak its search results to avoid such payments; inacceptable, fumed Franck Riester, the French culture minister. A proposal for an EU -wide digital tax has failed. Last month the EU \u2019s highest court ruled that the quintessentially European \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d (which, for example, forces Google to stop linking to old, embarrassing web content) applied only to searches carried out inside Europe."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2019/10/03/europe-has-so-many-issues-with-big-tech-it-hardly-knows-where-to-begin", "title": "Europe has so many issues with Big Tech it hardly knows where to begin", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["knows", "big", "european", "eu", "tax", "month", "google", "old", "tech", "begin", "privacy", "regulators", "issues", "search", "europe", "hardly"]}
