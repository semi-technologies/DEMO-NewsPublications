The commercial lacuna calls for an explanation. Gilliam, who is still productive at the age of eighty-six, is a leading light of what is termed the Washington Color School of abstract painting, which came to public attention around 1960 in thrall to the doctrines of Clement Greenberg, who influenced a generation of D.C. artists, including the highly successful Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. The critic posited flatness and appeals to eyesight alone as the destiny of new painting, as preordained by modernism. That was nuts, be it noted. But the era was still smitten with myths of formal progress in art, and Greenberg\u2019s proposition bore elegant fruit for a while. Gilliam broke ranks with the movement\u2014or extended it\u2014in the mid-sixties, when he began draping vast unstretched paint-stained and -spattered canvases from walls and ceilings, creating undulant environments that drenched the eye in effulgent color. (Dia:Beacon, in the Hudson Valley, has on view a magnificent example, \u201cDouble Merge,\u201d from 1968; exploring it is peripatetic bliss.)", "\u201cBlue 96\u2033 Disc,\u201d from 2020. Art work by Sam Gilliam / \u00a9 Sam Gilliam / ARS. Photograph by D'Angelo Lovell Williams for The New Yorker", "Gilliam\u2019s qualified apostasy, with a nod to the space-altering aesthetics of Minimalism, was widely noticed but, taking place outside New York, proved poorly situated and timed. Pop art, Minimalist sculpture and a proliferation of heterodox manners that came to be called post-Minimalism, and conceptual art were eclipsing anything to do with color-field painting\u2014and often with painting at all\u2014in the big town, and the Washington School could appear to be a provincial rear guard. Even so, Gilliam\u2019s breakthrough and subsequent achievements with his draping method should have loomed large in the moment\u2019s hot and heavy discourse. Why didn\u2019t they?", "\u201cFor John Lewis,\u201d from 2020. Art work by Sam Gilliam / \u00a9 Sam Gilliam / ARS. Photograph by D'Angelo Lovell Williams for The New Yorker", "Gilliam is Black, which in the art world back then identified an American artist as a special case, so remorseless was the presumed whiteness of \u201cmainstream\u201d Western culture. (An inaudible asterisk long attended mentions of, for example, the sorely underrated, late New York abstractionist Jack Whitten.) Gilliam\u2019s reception was dogged by a double bind of unconscious condescension and compensatory indulgence\u2014or so it seemed to me, over the years. This was more than uncommonly distracting in his case. Gilliam\u2019s art seemed to make no clear point of his identity apart from the occasional title, such as \u201cLady Day\u201d for a work in 1971, that signalled his cultural background. He is temperamentally a formalist from tip to toe, stalking meaning in nuances of format, color, texture, and the other technical givens of his medium: mainstream indeed, to ambitious art of the nineteen-sixties and, at intervals, ever since. It\u2019s possible to suspect reparative social justice in his renewed eminence, but really it\u2019s a chance to abolish one remnant of double-entry accounting of white and minority artists.", "New works from 2020. Art work by Sam Gilliam / \u00a9 Sam Gilliam / ARS. Photograph by D'Angelo Lovell Williams for The New Yorker", "Purgative, to this end, is a dazzlingly stylish essay in the Pace catalogue by the extraordinary Black scholar and poet Fred Moten\u2014a literary work of art in itself, ablaze with on-target wordplay\u2014which teases out inconspicuous racial imprints on Gilliam, from the sight (recalled by the artist) of women\u2019s washing billowing from clotheslines to the free-jazz innovations of Ornette Coleman and to tropes, in recent works, of African architecture and design. Antically exaggerated, the focus pays off, for me, by illuminating a peculiar psychological intensity in even Gilliam\u2019s most circumspect art: an air of taking nothing for granted and of having things to prove, an asperity in the face of felt or imagined resistance, a hint of playing for stakes beyond what\u2019s visible. The formalist credo\u2014what you see is what you see\u2014applies, but Moten proves that a racial audit frees up a general appreciation of Gilliam\u2019s excellence. It can\u2019t explain the art\u2019s self-critically disciplined integrity, skill, inventiveness, and abounding beauty. But Moten\u2019s audacity relaxes any lingering nervousness on the score of race by letting it rip, affirming Blackness as a regular feature, or quality, in American art, even or especially when it\u2019s not overtly at issue.", "Gilliam was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, the seventh child of a truck driver and a housewife. The family soon moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, having wanted to become a cartoonist since childhood, Gilliam plunged into art studies at the University of Louisville. In 1962, after returning from a two-year stint in the Army and earning an M.A. in fine arts, he relocated to the capital. His enthusiasms ranged across modern art, from German Expressionism through Picasso and Braque to Louis and Noland. He took to painting hard-edged stripes and geometric shapes, Washington Schoolishly dead flat. Then he jettisoned concerns with style for a redefinition of what paintings could be and do. His drapings enlist chance operations of pouring and flinging that gradually, as he less directed than monitored them, generate not so random instances of rhythmic snap and chromatic counterpoint. (A watcher as much as a wielder of paint, Gilliam rang a fresh change on Jackson Pollock\u2019s drip technique.) Each viewer of the softly hanging canvases comes to a unique experience of their cumulative effects and then, if sticking around, discovers yet another.", "Gilliam\u2019s quest persisted when he discontinued draping canvases around 1980 and returned to the wall by way of intensively pigmented compositions in types of free-form style, categorized at the time as \u201clyrical abstraction,\u201d often on constructed reliefs of angled and jutting planes\u2014a bit in the manner of contemporaneous works by Frank Stella, but zestier. Circles occurred, oddly portentous. Again, the works\u2019 key success is formal, as an effect of obdurate density and jagged animation. But Moten stays on the hunt for racial propensity. He relates Gilliam\u2019s affinity for circles to the title of a 1959 track from Ornette Coleman\u2019s 1970 album \u201cThe Art of the Improvisers\u201d: \u201cThe Circle with a Hole in the Middle,\u201d which mundanely describes a vinyl record but resonates with hints of a flaw or a void. (Moten upends the suggestion by titling his essay \u201cThe Circle with a Whole in the Middle.\u201d) Gilliam has embraced the form in recent large wall-mounted wooden doughnut shapes that are dyed, rather than painted, in gorgeous hues. One from this year is titled \u201cBlack Mozart / ORNETTE.\u201d Also new are works on sheets, some more than six feet square, of washi, a Japanese paper made from fibres of the inner bark of the gampi tree, the mitsumata shrub, or the paper mulberry. Repeatedly soaked in acrylics, allowed to dry, and then soaked again, the sheets end up not so much covered as replaced by slabs of solid monochrome, their surfaces varied, when you look closely, by traces of the artist\u2019s manipulating hand. These are blasts of pure chroma like nothing else I\u2019ve ever seen: while meltingly beautiful, they are no more passive than the front ends of oncoming trucks.", "The show\u2019s main news is in sculpture: there are several small pyramids and one immense one, all raised slightly off the floor and built of innumerable horizontal sheets of laminated plywood with regularly spaced bands of aluminum. Gorgeously dyed in sumptuous color\u2014bringing out and celebrating the textures of the wood grain\u2014the blunt structures radiate like light sources. Do they suggest late entries in the repertoire of Minimalism? They do, but with a sense of re-starting the aesthetic from scratch\u2014getting it right, even, at long last. The pieces play a role in another of the show\u2019s revelations: a series of large (up to twenty feet wide) neo- or post- or, let\u2019s say, para-color-field paintings that owe the ruggedness of their paint surfaces to incorporations of leftover pyramid sawdust. Bevelled edges flirt with object-ness, making the works seem fat material presentations, protuberant from walls, rather than pictures. But, as always with Gilliam, paint wins. Thick grounds in white or black are crazed with specks, splotches, and occasional dragged strokes of varied color. While you feel the weight of the wooden supports, your gaze loses itself in something like starry skies: dizzying impressions of infinite distance in tension with the dense grounds, which are complicated by tiny bits of collaged and overpainted wooden squares. Registering the jittery chromatic harmonies and occasional underlying structures\u2014ghosts of geometry\u2014takes time. Seemingly decorative at first glance, the paintings turn inexhaustibly absorbing and exciting when contemplated. Like everything else in this show of an artist who is old in years, they feel defiantly brand spanking new. \u2666"], "authors": ["Peter Schjeldahl", "Peter Schjeldah"], "keywords": ["sam", "read", "formalism", "work", "painting", "gilliam", "washington", "black", "works", "color", "gilliams", "art"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
