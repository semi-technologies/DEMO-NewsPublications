David Perdue, R-Ga., has tried to align his Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff with the \u201cdefund the police\u201d rallying cry of the far left, but Ossoff has sought to stake out a more moderate police reform stance that still appeases progressives.", "Perdue and Ossoff will face off in Georgia's highly contentious Jan. 5 runoff election that could determine the fate of the Senate\u2019s control.", "Here\u2019s where they stand on the issues of crime and policing:", "Jon Ossoff (D)", "Ossoff opposes defunding the police.", "\u201cI opposed defunding the police,\u201d Ossoff said in a SiriusXM radio interview in June. \u201cAnd quite frankly, it\u2019s a counterproductive and foolish way of characterizing what I think for some folks is a desire to reform the police.\u201d", "Ossoff, in another interview, called to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d the police.", "\u201cFar too many local police departments are heavily equipped with armored vehicles and military equipment, and when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d", "PERDUE V. OSSOFF ON HEALTH CARE: WHERE THEY STAND", "Still, the Perdue campaign has pointed to comments Ossoff made in a radio interview, also in June, citing: \u201cYou have to have national standards for use of force, and yeah, you\u2019ve got to be able to hold individual officers and entire departments accountable.\u201d", "The Ossoff campaign responded that the Democratic candidate was talking about supplemental police funding and that Ossoff\u2019s position is similar to that of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.", "In June, Biden told CBS News: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to the police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. And in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.\u201d", "Still, Ossoff has said that deep racial divides exist across the country and has supported a new Civil Rights Act to address police issues.

That\u2019s a major precept here. Second, I believe we need more training in these police forces to make sure we talk about when to use force and what level of force is appropriate,\u201d Perdue said on Fox News in June.", "\u201cThe use of lethal force is an extreme that we need to be very careful about. Last, we need a database to make sure bad apples don\u2019t just flow from one police precinct to another or from one jurisdiction to another.\u201d", "Perdue lauded bipartisan reform under the 2018 First Step Act, and said Democrats were showing a \u201clack of sincerity\u201d if they blocked the Senate police reform bill.", "\u201cThis is where we have to put politics aside.
