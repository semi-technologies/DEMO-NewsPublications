Sebastian Kurz has finally arrived. Teenagers and grandmothers swarm for selfies with the young leader of Austria\u2019s conservative People\u2019s Party ( \u00f6VP ). The upper stories on the handsome Theaterplatz, in Baden bei Wien, a spa town south of Vienna, are decked with banners in the \u00f6VP\u2019 s regulation turquoise. Someone has baked a cake. The atmosphere is somewhere between a supercharged summer fete and a heavyweight bout in Vegas.", "On September 29th the \u00f6VP is set to win a second consecutive election for the first time since the 1960s. As in 2017 its victory will belong in large part to Mr Kurz; the 33-year-old is Austria\u2019s most popular party leader by far. Detested by many urban liberals,he enjoys a star following in much of the rest of the country. \u201cHe\u2019s the only guy who wants to make a change,\u201d says Konrad Mylius, one of several teenage volunteers at the Baden rally sporting turquoise \u201cWir f\u00fcr Kurz\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019re for Kurz\u201d) T -shirts.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "It is all the more remarkable given that it is only four months since the spectacular implosion of Mr Kurz\u2019s government, a coalition with the right-wing Freedom Party ( FP\u00f6 ). In May two German newspapers published footage of Heinz-Christian Strache, FP\u00f6 leader and vice-chancellor, and an aide promising state contracts to a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch in exchange for favourable press coverage. The video, filmed during a boozy evening at an Ibiza villa five months before Mr Strache entered government, was dynamite. A furious Mr Kurz ejected the FP\u00f6 , and soon afterwards became the first Austrian chancellor to lose a confidence vote.", "Yet he has shrugged it all off. True, the culprits were not in his party. But it was Mr Kurz who, to the consternation of Austria\u2019s European partners, invited the FP\u00f6 , a party with Nazi roots, to join him in government in 2017. Even before Ibizagate the FP\u00f6 had proved a troublesome partner. Herbert Kickl, the interior minister and an FP\u00f6 ideologue, ordered a raid on a domestic intelligence agency. The government\u2019s collapse seemed to vindicate those who warned about the dangers of embracing the far right. Yet not only is Mr Kurz sure to be reinstalled as chancellor, he may well pick up where he left off with the FP\u00f6.", "Understanding how that is possible requires familiarity with the weariness that had descended on Austrian politics before Mr Kurz burst on to the scene. He built his brand in two ways. First, by spotting the gap in the centre-right market for a harder line on refugees. Having previously presented a liberal face on migration, during the 2015-16 crisis Mr Kurz, then foreign minister, began to talk tough on borders and asylum, and worked with Balkan governments to close migrant routes. Many voters lapped it up, though others feared Mr Kurz was normalising the far right.", "His second trick was to address Austrians\u2019 appetite for change. By 2017 endless \u201cgrand coalitions\u201d between the \u00f6VP and the Social Democrats ( SP\u00f6 ) had visibly run their course; two-thirds of voters said the country was on the wrong track. Mr Kurz took over the leadership of his ailing party, centralising control and instantly catapulting it from third to first place in the polls. Since then he has retained the aura of the outsider. By convincing voters that only a coalition with the FP\u00f6 could unleash his reformist energy, he assembled his government without much protest. \u201cThe work we did as a coalition was very successful,\u201d he tells The Economist in Baden, offering tax cuts and debt reduction as examples.", "Mr Kurz has brushed off recent mini-scandals over election spending and destroyed hard drives. Forming a government will be a bigger test. There are three main options: a grand coalition; a re-run of the partnership with the FP\u00f6 , which has emerged mostly unscathed from Ibizagate (although Mr Kurz will not work with Mr Kickl); or a dirndlgovernment (so-called for the colours of a traditional dress) with the Greens and the liberal Neos, who may between them command 20% of the vote."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/09/26/four-months-after-facing-crisis-sebastian-kurz-looks-like-winning-again", "title": "Four months after facing crisis, Sebastian Kurz looks like winning again", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["looks", "voters", "mr", "leader", "fp\u00f6", "crisis", "coalition", "baden", "\u00f6vp", "winning", "facing", "party", "months", "far", "sebastian", "kurz"]}
