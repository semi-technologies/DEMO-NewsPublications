Not only did the actor create one of the greatest Halloween-flicks of all time, Hocus Pocus, but every year, she hosts a Halloween extravaganza. Dubbed Hulaween, the event lures her star-studded circle of friends for a party where costumes are, of course, required.", "So what was to be done this year when trick-or-treating was essentially canceled and large in-person gatherings a frightful thought?

Directed by Seanne Farmer, the hour-long show unfolded like a documentary-style hunt for those three sister witches of Hocus Pocus. In the film, they rose from the dead before good conquered evil and they vanished once again. The wicked trio was made up of Winifred Sanderson a.k.a Winnie (played by a cupid\u2019s-bow-lipsticked-Midler), Sarah Sanderson (played by a wild-eyed Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary Sanderson (Kathy Najimy with talons-for-nails).

Onlookers witnessed celebrities\u2014who were filmed and filmed themselves in confessional and interview-style cameos\u2014tell their stories of the Sanderson Sisters. Some (Meryl Streep) played themselves and shared fictional tales of their encounters with the Sanderson sisters. Others (Glenn Close) took on madcap characters who claimed SSSes (Sanderson Sister Sightings). The show, which was hosted by Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (Cassandra Peterson), ended with the eventual revival of the sisters. It was a zany happily ever after, made even better by all the celebrity appearances: Mariah Carey, Billy Crystal, Jamie Lee Curtis, George Lopez, Martin Short, Sarah Silverman, John Stamos, Tiffany Haddish, Bella Hadid, Michael Kors, Lance Le Pere, and Law Roach. Plus, there were musical moments by Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson, and Todrick Hall.
