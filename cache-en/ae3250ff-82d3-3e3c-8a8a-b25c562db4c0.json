I think that the powers that be, especially on the liberal side of this country, truly believe Biden has saved America from Donald Trump. I mean, that's what they believe. That's what they think.

And I was so set aback that the entire conversation was this gleeful belief that now that Trump isn't going to be president, he's going to go to prison.
