On one hand, average U.S. homeowner incomes increased around 2.7% in September 2020 prior to the previous year, from $81,502 to $83,674. A typical homeowner in the U.S. spends 17.5% of their income on mortgage payments, property taxes and homeowner\u2019s insurance. That share has decreased in recent years because of extremely low interest rates, which is good news for homeowners and potential buyers, according to Glynn.", "However, home prices grew much quicker over the same period of time, with the average value of a U.S. home up by 5.8%.
