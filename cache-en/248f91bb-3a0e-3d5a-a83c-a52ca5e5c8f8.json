Her desk looks out on the street at knee height. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of writing a book about legs,\u201d Donaldson said, as she showed me around the house this summer. Children from the nearby school often wave in at her as they pass. Donaldson is well known in Steyning, due to her frequent signings at the local bookshop. She and her husband, Malcolm, a retired paediatrician, recently bought the local post office to save it from closure. But elsewhere she can walk the pavement without being recognised. \u201cI got a letter the other day for Jacqueline Wilson,\u201d Donaldson told me. \u201cIt said: \u2018You\u2019re my favourite author!\u2019\u201d", "If you are not someone who spends much time with young children, you may only be dimly aware of Donaldson\u2019s work \u2013 although you will probably be familiar with her most famous creation, the Gruffalo. If you have children, however, you will know her as a cultural juggernaut whose influence among children is perhaps only surpassed by the works of Disney and CBeebies. Donaldson, who is 72, has written more than 210 books: chiefly picture books, but also poetry, plays, a 60-part phonics reading scheme and a novel for preteens. Many of them \u2013 such as Room on the Broom, The Snail and the Whale, and What the Ladybird Heard \u2013 are already considered classics. Several have been adapted into stage shows and animated BBC films (the latest, Zog & the Flying Doctors, will air on Christmas Day) and spawned an ever-expanding Donaldson universe of toys, clothing and merchandise.", "Every night at bedtime, millions of children \u2013 pyjamas on, teeth reluctantly brushed \u2013 curl up to read or listen to a Donaldson story. Her fans include Michelle Obama and Prince William, who awarded Donaldson a CBE in 2019. \u201cJulia Donaldson is the unassailable queen of picture books,\u201d Kes Gray, creator of the hit Oi Frog! series, told me. The bestselling children\u2019s author David Walliams called Donaldson a \u201ccomplete and utter genius,\u201d adding: \u201cI am in total awe of her talent.\u201d", "In the UK, a Julia Donaldson book is sold about every 11 seconds, though even that fails to adequately capture the scale of her success. Better to say that between 2010 and 2019, more than 27m Julia Donaldson books were sold in the UK, making her the bestselling author of the decade in any age group or genre, according to the trade database Nielsen Bookscan. To put those numbers in context, the second bestselling author of the decade, David Walliams, sold 18.1m books. The bestselling author of books for adults, the novelist James Patterson, sold 14.1m. (JK Rowling did not make the top five.) The Sunday Times Rich List has estimated Donaldson\u2019s personal wealth at more than \u00a330m.", "Children\u2019s authors occupy a strange space in the literary world. Although children\u2019s books account for about a third of all books sold, they receive only 4.9% of review coverage \u2013 and, many authors argue, a similarly slim share of the prestige. The best-known children\u2019s authors \u2013 the Dahls, Pullmans and Rowlings of this world \u2013 have tended to write for older age groups, when children are reading to themselves. Picture books, on the other hand, while ostensibly for the child, are bought and read by an adult. As a result, the picture book market is driven by nostalgia. Parents and grandparents buy the books they remember having read to them as a child: The Tiger Who Came to Tea, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Mog. Booksellers stock their shelves accordingly. Breaking through as a new children\u2019s author is notoriously difficult.", "Picture books are easy to read \u2013 Donaldson\u2019s usually run at just 32 pages, and under 1,000 words \u2013 which can give the mistaken impression that they are easy to write. This myth has been reinforced by the publishing industry\u2019s penchant for indulging celebrity authors, who are seen as a guarantee of press coverage and sales, though the books themselves are often ghost-written or heavily edited, and few are unqualified successes. Donaldson has repeatedly complained that picture book authors do not receive \u201cthe recognition they deserve\u201d, lamenting at the 2019 Hay festival that \u201ceverything has to be the next big thing or else just go out of print\u201d.", "Similar charges, meanwhile, have been levelled at Donaldson, whose dominance of the picture book genre is seen by some as crowding out the market for new titles. \u201cSome authors are a bit sniffy about her, but I think that\u2019s just pure and simple jealousy because she\u2019s so successful and she gets all that shelf space,\u201d the author and illustrator Rob Biddulph told me. \u201cBut there\u2019s a reason for it: she\u2019s a genius.\u201d", "In the picture book trade, Donaldson is revered for her lyrical, rhyming verse and her ceaseless productivity. In 2020 alone, her publishers Scholastic and Macmillan have published What the Ladybird Heard at the Seaside (illustrated by Lydia Monks), The Teeny Weeny Genie (illustrated by Anna Currey), The Hospital Dog (Sara Ogilvie) and Counting Creatures (Sharon King-Chai). That\u2019s before you count reissues and the countless activity books, cookery books and other spin-offs not written by Donaldson but based on her creations.", "\u201cSomeone from another publisher happened to see my publishing schedule,\u201d Donaldson told me. \u201cThey said: \u2018That\u2019s more than the number of books we do altogether \u2013 for everyone.\u2019\u201d", "Still, the pandemic forced even Donaldson to a halt. \u201cI haven\u2019t really done much writing,\u201d Donaldson said. Even so, she had managed to write some poems, a song, begun editing two new poetry anthologies, and approved drafts of illustrations for her next books, due in 2021.", "Donaldson\u2019s house looks out on to Steyning\u2019s high street. It\u2019s an old place, timber framed, with additions over the years that mean the ceiling height changes from room to room. Off one bedroom is a tiny playroom too low for adults to stand up in \u2013 a den for her eight grandchildren when they come to visit. There are internal windows, blind corners, and everywhere art and scenery from her books and stage shows, giving the place a fantastical quality. When I visited in August, Donaldson wore a purple blouse with pink spots on and her grey hair cut in a fringe and to shoulder length, concealing her hearing aids. In her 30s, Donaldson was diagnosed with \u201ccookie-bite\u201d hearing loss \u2013 named for the bite-shaped hole that it leaves in the mid-range of the audible spectrum, making it difficult for sufferers to hear some speech and music. Masks prevent her from lip reading, so I removed mine and we sat in her garden, where Donaldson poured coffee into mugs decorated with art from The Go-Away Bird. (It is a mark of Donaldson\u2019s importance to Macmillan that we were accompanied by not one but two publicists.)", "With her ordinarily packed schedule of live events cancelled by coronavirus, this summer Donaldson instead decided to put on a series of livestreamed readings. The weekly videos featured Julia and Malcolm at home, delivering dramatic renditions of her back catalogue, often in full costume, and occasionally in song. Many of her illustrators also appeared, hosting drawing tutorials. The videos, which have a charmingly amateurish quality \u2013 shaky camerawork, home-spun costumes \u2013 culminated with Donaldson performing The Gruffalo in a local wood, wearing oversized mouse ears and a tan overcoat. In all, the films have been viewed more than 1m times.", "\u201cShe\u2019s got this great authenticity when she performs,\u201d her longtime illustrator Axel Scheffler told me. \u201cChildren see that and love it. There is still something \u2013 not improvised, but you can see they\u2019re not professional actors.\u201d", "Donaldson is as much a performer as a writer. One room in her house is dedicated just to her stage props, which tumble out of boxes, all oversized eyes and felted limbs. Even as a child, she envisioned a life on stage. \u201cI suppose it does stem from being attention-seeking, wanting to be famous and appreciated,\u201d she said.", "Donaldson was born in 1948, and grew up in a three-storey Victorian house in Hampstead, north London, yards from Hampstead Heath. To save money, Donaldson\u2019s extended family bought the house together: her aunt and uncle lived on the top floor, her grandmother on the floor below, and Julia, her parents and her sister, Mary, on the ground floor. When Julia was six, her father contracted polio, and thereafter needed a wheelchair. Even so, he played cello in a string quartet, and her mother sang in a local choir group, and Donaldson recalls a house filled with music and stories.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Donaldson with the Singing Mermaid, and Snake from The Gruffalo. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian", "One year, Donaldson\u2019s father gave her a copy of A Book of 1,000 Poems, a compilation of classic children\u2019s poetry. Donaldson loved it so much that she began talking to her parents in verse. She resolved to become a poet. (She keeps the book on her desk even now.) She performed constantly \u2013 at school, and at home, hanging off the top bunk to stage puppet shows for her sister. At 12, she landed an understudy role in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream at the Bristol Old Vic theatre. Among the cast was a young Judi Dench. \u201cEvery performance I would sit backstage on Old Ninny\u2019s tomb and watch. I knew that play completely off by heart.\u201d", "Children\u2019s authors are often described as being in touch with their inner child, or childlike. With Donaldson, it\u2019s more that she so vividly remembers the experience of her own childhood, that she remembers what it\u2019s like to encounter a grownup. \u201cI always used to think: why do grownups not walk along walls? Is it because they don\u2019t want to \u2013 which is unthinkable \u2013 or do they want to terribly, but they know that grownups just mustn\u2019t?\u201d", "She studied drama at Bristol University, and in 1969 spent a summer studying in Paris with a friend. Malcolm, then a medical student and a friend-of-the-friend, joined them. The group made money busking. Malcolm played guitar and Julia sang, covers mostly, but increasingly songs of her own \u2013 little ditties in French, a song in Italian about pasta \u2013 designed to amuse the crowd. Throughout the early 70s, they spent holidays busking across Europe and the US and performing street theatre. (They wed in 1972; Donaldson composed an operetta for the occasion.) In 1977, she and Malcolm recorded an album, First Fourteen, containing some of their early songs, which have a folksy, absurdist charm, reminiscent of early Monty Python.", "In 1974, she sent a tape of children\u2019s songs to the BBC, and was commissioned to write music for the children\u2019s TV series Play Away. \u201cI really wanted to be a presenter,\u201d Donaldson told me. \u201cI did have an audition and didn\u2019t get it. They said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you just keep on with the writing?\u2019\u201d Songwriting was irregular work, so Donaldson took a series of jobs in publishing and radio, eventually landing as a teacher in a private girl\u2019s school in Brighton. \u201cThe girls thought I was the bee\u2019s knees, because all the other teachers were very ancient and traditional,\u201d she said. Even after she quit teaching following the birth of her first child, Hamish, she continued to volunteer at schools, running drama clubs and writing musicals for children.", "On stage, Donaldson exudes an irresistible, benevolent energy. Young children, she says, make for a perfect audience: \u201cThey want to be entertained, and they want to join in.\u201d She and Malcolm still regularly perform on stage and at signings, for which families can queue for hours. (Impatient parents cause more problems than children. \u201cThere was one event where people were banging on the windows \u2013 it was almost that slightly rioting feel,\u201d Lydia Monks, who has illustrated 18 of Donaldson\u2019s books, told me.)", "\u201cPicture books are theatre for an audience of two,\u201d said Kate Wilson, the managing director of publishers Nosy Crow and Donaldson\u2019s former publisher. \u201cThey require performance, because most of the audience of a picture book is not able to read. And Julia is a performer.\u201d", "In 1991 an editor in the children\u2019s department at Methuen contacted Donaldson to ask if she would be interested in turning one of her BBC songs into a book. A Squash and a Squeeze was published in 1993, when Donaldson was 44. It was not expected to be a big seller. For one thing, it was in rhyme, which publishers at the time largely avoided because of difficulties with translation. \u201cIn order for a picture book to be profitable, you more or less have to glue some foreign editions on, so you can do a bigger print run,\u201d Donaldson said.", "\u201cIt was a rule we held to be self-evident that you couldn\u2019t afford to do rhyming books,\u201d Wilson, who then worked in Methuen\u2019s rights department, told me, somewhat sheepishly. (The book has since sold more than 1.5m copies, and Donaldson\u2019s work has been translated into more than 50 languages.) Today, a significant proportion of picture books are written in verse, somewhat to Donaldson\u2019s bemusement. \u201cI think there\u2019s far too many rhyming books. And a lot of them \u2013 I don\u2019t want to sound vain or anything \u2013 a lot of them make me cringe.\u201d", "The initial illustrator for A Squash and a Squeeze fell through, so Wilson suggested her boyfriend, a German illustrator named Axel Scheffler. The collaboration nearly failed at the start: Methuen initially felt Scheffler\u2019s sketches were too intimidating. \u201cMy little old lady would have been a little more spiky. They said: \u2018It needs to be more joyous\u2019,\u201d Scheffler told me when we spoke. \u201cMaybe I was just too obedient. I should have said no.\u201d", "Although some authors also illustrate their own work \u2013 Theodor Geisel (AKA Dr Seuss), Maurice Sendak, Judith Kerr \u2013 few can write and draw equally well. The collaboration between writer and illustrator is less intimate than readers assume. Typically, the illustrator is assigned the text by an art director, and rarely communicates with the author directly. Even Donaldson and Scheffler operate almost entirely independently. \u201cWe never discuss anything [during the writing],\u201d Scheffler told me. \u201cIt\u2019s never that we sit down and talk about it or I make suggestions.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Axel Scheffler painting the Gruffalo. Photograph: Joe Turp/British Library", "The work of the illustrator is partly divination: conjuring a world into life from the letters on a page. But they are equally storytellers, adding visual elements \u2013 a character detail, a visual gag \u2013 that elevate a tale beyond the author\u2019s intention. \u201cWhen you\u2019re writing a book, the illustrator brings something to it that you can\u2019t really control \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t want to totally control how the illustrations are,\u201d Donaldson said. Only rarely will she insist upon changes to the artwork, she says, when a character drifts too far from the one in her imagination. (\u201cShe is completely in control,\u201d Scheffler said.)", "Donaldson now works with more than a dozen illustrators. Many, like Scheffler, have thriving careers as standalone authors. (Scheffler\u2019s books are actually written by a Nosy Crow editor, Camilla Reed. \u201cI can\u2019t write, the publisher was pretending,\u201d Scheffler told me.) For a new illustrator, being approached for a Donaldson book is a golden ticket: the \u201cby the author of the Gruffalo\u201d stickers that adorn her books more or less guarantee bestseller status. Many Waterstones branches dedicate an entire bay to Donaldson\u2019s work.", "The phenomenon is not always looked upon kindly. Gradual consolidation of the books market \u2013 fewer independents, and more people buying in supermarkets or online \u2013 has, in some opinions, skewed the market towards bigger authors. \u201cBuyers for supermarkets are looking to sell as many copies as possible, so they will favour surefire bankable brands like Julia Donaldson,\u201d Philip Stone, an analyst at Nielsen, told me. That means fewer spaces for new authors at a time when the industry is struggling with diversity, on and off the page.", "\u201cI do look at the industry and just think, well, they put all their money into the Julia books,\u201d Monks told me. \u201cI can see that the experience of my own books being published is different to Julia\u2019s. The advances are different, and the marketing budget \u2013 I don\u2019t even know if most books have a marketing budget.\u201d", "\u201cI always feel slightly guilty that we are dominating the bookshops,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI only hope that our books will open people up to buy other books.\u201d", "Publishing budgets, of course, are beyond Donaldson\u2019s control; and her books have been praised for their depictions of diversity. When I put Scheffler\u2019s remark to her in an email, she declined to comment, only adding that \u201cnowadays there is more of a variety in the bestseller charts than there was a few years ago\u201d.", "The Gruffalo\u2019s origin story has been told so often that it has almost a touch of fable: how the story was inspired by a Chinese folk tale, how the original draft sat on the desk of an editor at Reid Books for months before a frustrated Donaldson eventually sent the text to Scheffler (\u201ca very unconventional thing to do,\u201d Donaldson said) who showed it to Macmillan, which bought it immediately.", "In Steyning, Donaldson showed me pictures of the notebook in which she wrote the Gruffalo (the original was being digitised for her website). The book was in her head for a year before she sat down to write. \u201cNormally there\u2019s a long time between germination and the writing,\u201d Donaldson told me. Her ideas can come from anywhere. Some come from readers. Many more are inspired by folk tales or poems. The Highway Rat, for example, is a re-imagining of Alfred Noyes\u2019s The Highwayman.", "Picture books, Donaldson said, \u201care not like a novel. They\u2019re really a bit more like a song. Because they\u2019re short, the structure becomes very important.\u201d Many of her books centre on a refrain, which will dictate the meter. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to rhyme, it\u2019s just terribly important that there\u2019s some repeated phrase, some sort of chorus-y bit.\u201d She came up with the monster\u2019s name \u201cGruffalo\u201d because it happened to rhyme with the mouse\u2019s refrain: \u201cSilly old Fox, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d", "Her original notes for The Gruffalo are written in a neat hand. Down the right-hand side of the page is a list of body parts: \u201ctoes nose spots stripes eyes feet legs tail\u201d. Phrases are crossed out and corrected repeatedly. \u201cWho is this creature with spiky claws \u2026 terrible claws \u2026 enormous jaws,\u201d Donaldson read, as if it was 1995 again, and she was thinking aloud. Often she will come up with dozens of little phrases, writing less by stream of consciousness than fastidious assembly. She took out the notebook for The Detective Dog, which was similarly filled with such snippets, like collage fabric: \u201cSolved the case, cleared up the case, found the answer, got it right, puzzled it out, tracked them all down, got to the bottom of it,\u201d Donaldson read.", "Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning", "She revises relentlessly. The Gruffalo\u2019s wings become eyes; \u201cspikes and spines all over his back\u201d become the more pleasing \u201cpurple prickles\u201d. \u201cShe writes very independently,\u201d Hannah Ray, her Macmillan editor, told me. \u201cShe will do rounds of rewriting and she will only send it in when it\u2019s absolutely perfect.\u201d", "Donaldson is obsessed with scansion \u2013 where the stresses fall in a line. That, too, is influenced by her years of songwriting. \u201cA tune won\u2019t come into my head when I\u2019m writing a picture book, but a rhythm does,\u201d Donaldson said.", "\u201cThe books flatter you into thinking that you\u2019re absolutely brilliant at reading,\u201d Martin Pope, the co-founder of Magic Light Pictures, which produces the animated films of Donaldson\u2019s work, told me. \u201cNot only is each line beautifully written so that you can feel the rhythm of it, it\u2019s very clear how to read it, and where the jokes are.\u201d", "At her best, as with the susurrous, wave-like meter of The Snail and the Whale, she is irresistible: \u201cAnd she gazed at the sky, the sea, the land / The waves and the caves and the golden sand / She gazed and gazed, amazed by it all / And she said to the whale, \u2018I feel so small.\u2019\u201d", "The Gruffalo was released in 1999, and met with immediate success. The book won the prestigious Smarties prize, which Donaldson accepted wearing a Gruffalo hand puppet. At the time she was working as a writer in residence at a school in Easterhouse, a deprived area of Glasgow. When Donaldson returned from the ceremony, the children gave her a gold star.", "The Gruffalo sparked a surge of creativity and a run of bestsellers. But away from books, Donaldson\u2019s home life was fraught with difficulty. Hamish, the eldest of her three sons, suffered from depression and psychosis, and was hospitalised. He was eventually diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. In 2003, Donaldson\u2019s nephew Gaius, who also suffered from depression, died by suicide. A month later, Hamish killed himself. He was 25.", "Despite the immensity of her grief, she continued writing: in 2005 she released 11 new titles. \u201cI was very used to compartmentalising,\u201d Donaldson told me. \u201cThat\u2019s what kept me going all through the years when we were dealing with his very difficult adolescence.\u201d", "Hamish is present in much of Donaldson\u2019s work. As a child, he had an imaginary friend who lived in the mirror. \u201cHe would get in the wardrobe \u2026 then he would come out, but he would be Sammy or Lola the cat. For several hours he would be someone else,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cIt was all very imaginative.\u201d The memory inspired the Princess Mirror-Belle books, which are being adapted for TV by the BBC. Other connections were more subconscious. \u201cI realised afterwards that I had [written] books like Stick Man and Tiddler, which are both about a family member disappearing, but actually coming back.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Julia Donaldson at home with a character from The Smeds & the Smoos. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian", "Hamish\u2019s illness is most present in Donaldson\u2019s 2009 novel Running on the Cracks, in which a young runaway befriends an elderly woman who suffers a psychotic episode. \u201cThe ways she talks when she\u2019s really going into the psychotic episode is quite based on how Hamish \u2026 the sort of things he might have said,\u201d Donaldson told me. Donaldson is now patron of Artlink Central, a Scottish arts charity that works with children struggling with mental health problems.", "Once asked to summarise her life in six words, Donaldson said: \u201cDespite sadness, I feel very fulfilled.\u201d I asked if, to her, happiness and fulfilment are different things. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cI suppose everyone has, you know, some cross to bear. You just have to carry on, I suppose. The books meant a huge amount. It was brilliant for me that I had this other side to my life that I was getting pleasure and recognition from.\u201d", "More than 100 books later, The Gruffalo still overshadows Donaldson\u2019s other work. \u201cIt\u2019s always \u2018The Gruffalo\u2019 and then \u2018your other books\u2019,\u201d Donaldson said, visibly frustrated. She often says that she feels like the mouse in the story, who imagines the monster, only to find that it has a life of its own. Still, its success has enabled her to publish more personal work: her poetry anthologies, Running on the Cracks, a book of her songs. \u201cI like to call it a trampoline, lifting up the other things.\u201d", "In recent years, Donaldson\u2019s work has appeared to become \u2013 at least by the standard of picture books \u2013 more political. She has campaigned passionately against cuts to library funding; she and Scheffler also marched against Brexit. The pair\u2019s most recent collaboration, 2019\u2019s The Smeds and the Smoos, is a love story between two aliens of different species whose mutual hatred is revealed to be built on increasingly ludicrous prejudices. (\u201cThey drink pink milk! They eat brown bread!\u201d) Scheffler\u2019s dedication for the book reads: \u201cTo all the children of Europe.\u201d Donaldson, however, told me the book\u2019s timing was a coincidence. \u201cI\u2019ve got notes that I wrote for that story from literally seven years ago,\u201d Donaldson told me. Similarly, her latest book, The Hospital Dog, was conceived long before the pandemic.", "If Donaldson\u2019s books feel timely, it\u2019s because their messages are ultimately timeless: decency, empathy, humour. \u201cSo many of Julia\u2019s stories are about kindness,\u201d Scheffler said. Donaldson has railed against what she calls \u201cbooks as medicine\u201d \u2013 children\u2019s publishing\u2019s tendency towards books with an obvious social message, such as feminism or the climate crisis. \u201cI think now people are doing these terribly message-y books,\u201d Donaldson told me. \u201cI\u2019m just as feminist as anyone else, but you know there are now lots of books to show that girls can be feisty.\u201d She balks at the idea of picture books as activism. \u201cEven if its message was something I really care about, like saving the planet, I probably wouldn\u2019t do it unless I had a really juicy idea.\u201d", "She is unafraid to touch upon seemingly adult themes, such as bereavement. \u201cThere are an awful lot of books about \u2018I love you mummy\u2019. \u2018Yes, I love you, too, darling little bear!\u2019 I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s not a place for those, but there\u2019s so many books on that which I think are probably quite reassuring for the parents,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cMost children I would hope take for granted that their parents or carers love them. They want a story where you\u2019re not with them, and you\u2019re having some sort of adventure.\u201d", "Donaldson\u2019s books are not for children\u2019s benefit, but their enjoyment. \u201cHer stories are never twee,\u201d Walliams said. \u201cThere is often real danger, and her characters don\u2019t always do the right thing. The result is that the books are proper page-turners.\u201d The quick-witted hero always bests the villain, the brave snail/fish/stick overcomes great peril to find their way home.", "\u2018Feasting on fantasy\u2019: my month of extreme immersion in Disney+ Read more", "If there is a recurring theme to Donaldson\u2019s work, it is the transportive power of stories. Several of her books feature libraries, which she avidly visited as a child, and imbues with a quasi-religious power. Perhaps better than any of her contemporaries, she understands that picture books are more than bedtime stories \u2013 they\u2019re one of the first windows children have on to the wider world, the means by which they first experience fantasy, encounter danger, discern the difference between monsters and heroes.
