Among them was Giorgia Meloni, who at the age of 15 chose to join the youth branch of the Italian Social Movement ( MSI ), the direct heirs of the Fascist Party and its leader, Benito Mussolini, who ruled Italy as a dictator until 1943.", "Today Ms Meloni is riding high as a leader herself. Her party, the Brothers of Italy ( F d I ), has been the outstanding beneficiary of the covid-19 pandemic. Since late February, when it was already on a roll, the party has climbed steadily in the opinion polls from around 12% to more than 16%. It has overtaken the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, notionally the senior partner in Giuseppe Conte\u2019s governing coalition. The F d I is \u201cbecoming firmly established as Italy\u2019s third party\u201d, says Antonio Noto of Noto Sondaggi, a polling firm. Nor is it unthinkable that it may soon become the second. Some recent soundings have put Ms Meloni\u2019s party just four points behind the centre-left Democratic Party, also in the government. Mr Conte\u2019s coalition looks increasingly fragile. It is split by a row over divvying out money from the EU \u2019s covid-19 recovery fund. Were it to fall, an election might produce a hard-right coalition government consisting of the F d I and Matteo Salvini\u2019s Northern League, which still leads in the opinion polls, with around 24%.", "The rise in the Brothers\u2019 popularity has almost exactly matched the fall in support for the League. Mr Salvini\u2019s raucous showmanship has jarred with an electorate gripped by fear of the virus and its economic consequences. At the same time even diehard nativists must question the League\u2019s leader\u2019s continuing emphasis on unauthorised immigration. So far this year 33,000 migrants have reached Italy, almost three times as many as in 2019 but a far cry from the 181,000 who arrived in 2017.", "Ms Meloni has conveyed a more nuanced and sober message, typical of her canny stewardship of a movement that two years ago won less than 5% of the vote at the last general election. Brothers of Italy may be a slightly odd name for a party led by a woman, but it echoes the first line of the national anthem. Under Ms Meloni the F d I has remained passionately nationalistic and wedded to identity politics. Its motto is \u201cGod, family and fatherland\u201d. Top of its 15-point programme is greatly increased support for families, to boost the birth rate so Italy no longer needs immigrant workers. It is fiercely against giving automatic citizenship to children born in Italy of immigrant parents, and would impose a naval blockade to stop further arrivals.", "The F d I originated in 2012 as a splinter group, made up of lawmakers from the right of Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s catch-all conservative alliance, the People of Freedom. It particularly objected to the TV mogul\u2019s high-handed leadership and his tolerance of EU -imposed austerity. The Brothers\u2019 programme calls for a \u201crediscussion\u201d of all the EU \u2019s treaties, including those underpinning the euro.", "But since taking over the leadership in 2014, Ms Meloni, unlike Mr Salvini, has played down her party\u2019s Euroscepticism. In other areas, too, she has striven to give her party a more moderate image. That got a boost in September when she was elected head of the pan-continental European Conservatives and Reformists Party. Though it includes the likes of Vox in Spain and Poland\u2019s Law and Justice party, it also includes Britain\u2019s Conservatives, allowing the F d I to project itself as no longer belonging to the extreme right."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["italy", "roll", "meloni", "unchained", "brothers", "ms", "party", "mr", "movement", "d", "f", "eu"], "pubDate": "2020-12-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
