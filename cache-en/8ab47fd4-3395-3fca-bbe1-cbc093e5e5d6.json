The event was co-hosted by Sarah Shotton, Agent Provocateur\u2019s creative director, and Gizzi Erskine, chef and writer. Erskine stars as the face of Agent Provocateur\u2019s latest campaign, featuring strong women at the top of their game. Vogue Market Editors Naomi Elizee and Maddy Swanson kicked off the conversation dressed in slinky Agent Provocateur kimonos as the group toasted the hosts with a glass of Ruinart Champagne.", "The plat du jour was Erskine\u2019s Green Tomato Salsa and Shakshuka. Thanks to Fra\u00eeche, a sustainable food delivery platform that works closely with local farm stands nationwide, groceries were hand-delivered first thing in the morning. As guests began prepping their Fra\u00eeche ingredients, Shotton offered some insight into her 21-year tenure at Agent Provocateur, which began shortly after her graduation from Central Saint Martins. After working her way up the ladder, she landed the role of creative director. \u201cI think Joseph Corr\u00e9 took a liking to me as I reminded him of his mother,\u201d she jokes of Agent Provocateur\u2019s co-founder and son of the legendary Vivienne Westwood. \u201cWe\u2019re both red-headed Northern girls.\u201d Shotton\u2019s interest in lingerie design was born from a lack of sexy, comfortable bras for curvaceous women. Over the years, she has worked to change the outlook of lingerie designers and inspire consumers to liberate their inner superwoman. Who better for the campaign than Erskine, a businesswoman with such a multifaceted personality? \u201cFor me, she is almost like Sophia Loren,\u201d Shotton said of her muse. \u201cA rare starlet and so very Agent Provocateur.\u201d", "The relationship began when Erskine quite literally slid into Shotton\u2019s DMs. A message that subsequently blossomed into a close friendship built on mutual respect and admiration for each other. Erskine describes Shotton as \u201ca magician.\u201d After collectively whizzing up the green tomato salsa in a food processor, a few brave, budding chefs proceeded onto part two: Green Shakshuka. In the midst of what can only be described as the most fabulously haphazard cooking class, Erskine shed some light on her upcoming cookbook, Restore (Harper Collins). In addition to providing delicious recipes, Erskine hopes that her readers use Restore as a learning tool for being an ethical and agriculturally savvy eater.", "\u201cI\u2019m a soil nerd!\u201d says Erskine, who has spent the past four years examining the environmental concerns around monocropping, waste, and the meat and dairy industry. Chef and soil nerd by day, Sophia Loren by night, she is the true embodiment of an Agent Provocateur woman."], "authors": ["Jasmine Contomichalos", "Jasmine Contomichalo"], "keywords": ["provocateur", "way", "class", "cooking", "agent", "tomato", "vogue100", "gizzi", "host", "shotton", "virtual", "began", "erskine", "women", "provocateurs", "green"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
