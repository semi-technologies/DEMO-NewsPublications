The end of peak travel season\u2014and its overpriced airline tickets, jacked up lodging costs, and crowds.", "Fall, with its calmer\u2014and cheaper\u2014charms is, in my opinion, the best time to travel. But where to go is quite the loaded question. To make deciding easier, here are a set of destinations to consider from the get-go. They\u2019ve got new, interesting hotels or events that will have you ahead of the pack, should you go.", "Kingston, New York", "Summer may belong to the Hamptons, but autumn is best spent in the Hudson Valley.

He\u2019s designed each building to be different, with a mixture of Scandinavian and bohemian touches, vintage furniture, and lots of greenery. Bonus: each room comes with a self-serve bar\u2014so a nightcap is never out of reach.", "The food is by Taavo Somer, of perennially trendy Gemma in the Bowery Hotel and perennially divey bar The Rusty Knot (their pretzel dogs: if you know, you know). Restaurant Kinsley serves up a locally sourced menu of feel-good food like lamb meatballs and pasta with stracciatella.", "Plus, the town of Kingston is only two hours away from New York City\u2014perfect for anyone with wanderlust, but also for those with just a weekend.", "Downtown Los Angeles", "The resurgence of downtown L.A. continues with a wave of new hotel openings: The Hoxton (open for business come October), the Wayfarer, the Kelly Wearstler-designed The Proper (opening fall 2019), and the 110,000 square foot Soho Warehouse, the Soho House\u2019s latest club-slash-lodging location. According to the Los Angeles\u2019s visitors bureau, visitors to DTLA\u2014which is made up of diverse areas like the Arts District, Little Tokyo, and El Pueblo\u2014is at an all time high: 30 percent of visitors to Los Angeles are now exploring Downtown.", "And with good reason: DTLA has been positioning itself as a dynamic district for a few years running, with 2015\u2019s arrival of The Broad, the streetwear hub of Sneaker Row, the food stalls of Grand Central Market and, come 2020, the arrival of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. While the city is still struggling to address affordable housing, the area is bound to be increasingly populated, not just by tourists: hundreds of residential units are in development in addition to the area's hotels.", "Setouchi Islands, Japan", "Every three years, the Setouchi Islands of Japan (aka the \u201cart islands\u201d) hold the Setouchi Art Triennale, a contemporary festival where works by 150 international artists are scattered across 12 different islands in the region.

But the historic city is still a must visit for anyone looking to understand the origins of Western culture and society\u2014and to enjoy a good dish of pasta while they\u2019re at it.", "Come fall, the tour groups will have subsided, and the baking Italian sun waned. That\u2019s when you should book a room at Hotel Calimala, a new accommodation in Florence\u2019s Centro Storico neighborhood that opens in early October. Designed by Alex Meitilis, who worked on all the Ottolenghi restaurants in London, Calimala boasts entirely custom-made furniture and a curated art collection.

This August, there was the arrival of Sonop Namibia, a five-star property designed to evoke an explorer\u2019s camp from the 1920s. In October, andBeyond Sossusvlei reopens its set of ten solar-powered suites after a nearly-year long renovation. It\u2019s not your typical safari trip, but the opportunities for a unique adventure are endless. Much of the sky above the Namib Desert is an International Dark Sky Reserve, meaning it\u2019s some of the best stargazing in the world. Travelers can also see cheetahs, jackals, and hyenas. And for the truly intrepid, there\u2019s a multi-day trek to see where the dunes meet the sea\u2014which feels like the end of the earth."], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Elise Taylor"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/5-places-to-travel-this-fall", "keywords": ["los", "includes", "islands", "fall", "theres", "visitors", "food", "travel", "places", "setouchi", "hotel", "know", "designed"], "summary": "I know, I know, it\u2019s sad that summer is coming to an end.\nThe end of peak travel season\u2014and its overpriced airline tickets, jacked up lodging costs, and crowds.\nFall, with its calmer\u2014and cheaper\u2014charms is, in my opinion, the best time to travel.\nSetouchi Islands, JapanEvery three years, the Setouchi Islands of Japan (aka the \u201cart islands\u201d) hold the Setouchi Art Triennale, a contemporary festival where works by 150 international artists are scattered across 12 different islands in the region.\nThen there\u2019s the Setouchi Island\u2019s \u201cpermanent\u201d collection, which includes earthworks by artists like Yayoi Kusuma, James Turrell, Walter de Maria and architect Tadao Ando.", "title": "5 Places to Travel This Fall"}
