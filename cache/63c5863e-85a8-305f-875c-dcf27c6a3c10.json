Still, as they contemplated falling short, Democrats argued that their main problem this year was simply political geography: To gain the majority, they had to unseat Republicans in states carried by Mr. Trump, when Senate races typically go in the direction of the state\u2019s presidential race.", "\u201cThe map was very difficult for us,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who formulated the Democratic campaign strategy. He noted that Republicans had been defending seats in just two states carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016: Maine and Colorado. Mr. Schumer\u2019s decision to try to expand the playing field to force Republicans to expend more resources and give Democrats a chance at the majority succeeded to a degree by putting more races in play. But it only went so far.", "With the exception of Maine, where Ms. Collins defied the odds, the emerging presidential results appeared to be corresponding to the Senate outcome, with Democrats winning in Colorado, where Mr. Biden prevailed, and in Arizona, where he had opened a lead. But it meant that Republicans were able to survive well-funded Democratic challenges in states like Iowa, Montana and probably North Carolina.", "Despite expectations in both parties that Mr. Trump\u2019s presence on the ballot would hamper Republicans in competitive states and districts, the president appeared to have had substantial coattails in conservative-leaning states, turning out core constituencies to re-elect the incumbents crucial to maintaining the party\u2019s hold on the Senate. In other areas where the president was weaker, such as Democratic-leaning Maine and more conservative suburban House districts nationwide, voters seemed to have stuck with the Republicans they knew rather than taking a chance on Democrats."], "authors": ["Carl Hulse"], "keywords": ["senate", "decision", "maine", "appeared", "president", "republicans", "states", "democrats", "split", "races", "mr", "presidential"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
