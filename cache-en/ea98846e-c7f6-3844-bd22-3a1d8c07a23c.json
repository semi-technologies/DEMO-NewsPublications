It is expected to be the final new coal power project built in the Asian nation.", "The pledge comes after President Moon Jae-in in October promised that Korea would achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and spend Won8tn on environmentally-friendly growth initiatives. But many Korean manufacturers have found it hard to shift away from fossil fuels because of their heavy dependence on coal.", "The Korea Beyond Coal campaign \u2014 a network of civic and environmental groups \u2014 asked the country\u2019s biggest 30 asset managers if they planned to buy bonds that will be issued to fund the plant\u2019s construction.

It plans to raise the shortfall by issuing bonds over the next three years.", "It is estimated that Samcheok Blue Power will emit about 390m tonnes of greenhouse gases during its lifetime, assuming it is finished by 2024 and has a 30-year lifespan. That alone could cancel out Seoul\u2019s Green New Deal plan, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gases by 12.3m tonnes by 2025.", "\u201cOnce the plant begins operations, these reduction efforts will go to waste,\u201d said Park Jee-hye, campaign director of Korea Beyond Coal.", "Activists have called for the project to be cancelled, citing its significant environmental and financial risks. Solar power is expected to become cheaper than coal in Korea as early as next year.", "Coal financing remains a problem in the country. Financial companies have funnelled $55bn into coal-fired power projects since 2009, including $23bn via corporate bonds.", "Korea, the world\u2019s 12th largest economy, is the seventh-largest carbon emitter.
