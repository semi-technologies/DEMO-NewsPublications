For starters, COVID-19 lockdowns and the new WFH lifestyle has caused many of us to rethink our wardrobes: We basically all live in loungewear now. A Juicy tracksuit couldn\u2019t feel more timely. \u201cPost-quarantine, everyone's wardrobe and waistbands have gotten a lot more relaxed,\u201d says Hilton, who is still a fan of the Juicy look. \u201cPeople aren't going into the office as much, but you want to look stylish, and there's something about a Juicy Couture tracksuit that you don't look like a slob. There\u2019s something refined about it.\u201d In the fashion world, there have been signs that the Juicy tracksuit is slowly creeping back into our closet, too. Remember when Vetements partnered with Juicy on runway tracksuits in 2016, and then Rihanna wore it a year later on the streets? More recently, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet broke the Internet with his pink Juicy hoodie which he wore in an issue of GQ, and Kim Kardashian West even released her own velour tracksuit line for Skims, tapping Paris Hilton to star in the promo photos with her (an obvious nod to their early-aughts Juicy days).", "For stars like Kardashian West and Hilton, the love for Juicy has clearly never stopped. But they\u2019re not the only ones. Below, Vogue also asked nine Juicy superfans to look back on the craze\u2014including celebrities, stylists, and vintage experts\u2014and share why they\u2019re excited about its return.", "Tiffany Pollard, reality star and 2000s icon", "I love Juicy Couture! Back in the day, they had the best (and most comfy) two-piece terry cloth sweat suits. I had one in pink and I had one in sky blue\u2014I wore the hell out of both of them. And I also drowned myself in \u201cViva la Juicy\u201d perfume. It\u2019s still my favorite Juicy Couture fragrances \u2018til this day.", "Nicky Hilton Rothschild, businesswoman and socialite", "My friend Lara Shriftman did the PR for Juicy [in the 2000s], so she gave Paris and I some pieces. We fell in love with it and it became our uniform. It was love at first sight. All the fun, bright colors. We were living in L.A. at the time time, and they really had that laid-back, California girl thing going on. One of the first things I wore was definitely a tracksuit. I also remember wearing the terry cloth tube dresses. Paris wore the more bright, bubblegum pink ones; I wore the navy, hunter green, and black. But definitely with rhinestones. I have a few of the originals. The brand recently sent me a velour tracksuit with my name in crystals on the back in Old English writing. But when Paris and I got robbed in the Hollywood Hills in the early 2000s, they stole a lot of our treasures! The [Dior] Saddle bags, the Louis Vuitton x Sprouse, and the Juicy."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["hilton", "juicy", "superfans", "couture", "cant", "2000s", "paris", "wore", "love", "quit", "tracksuit", "look", "pink"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
