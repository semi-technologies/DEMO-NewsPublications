For twenty-three years, Smith worked at Fox News; he was the host of \u201cShepard Smith Reporting,\u201d one of the few nonpartisan programs on the network, which aired at 3 P.M. on weekdays. Smith was one of the first people hired by Roger Ailes, Fox News\u2019s founding C.E.O., and he stuck it out through the network\u2019s various kerfuffles, from Ailes\u2019s sexual-harassment scandal to the breakup of Sean Hannity and Alan Colmes. He tolerated abuse from Trump, who gave him the moniker \u201clow ratings Shep Smith.\u201d And, after coming out as gay, he put up with viewers demanding that his show be cancelled. Then came Tucker Carlson, the channel\u2019s new 8 P.M. guy. One evening, Carlson mocked Smith on the air, implying that the daytime host had a liberal bias. Two weeks later, Smith resigned, just over a year after the network had extended his contract\u2014a reported fifteen million dollars annually.", "Shepard Smith Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "That was a year ago. \u201cI\u2019m doing great,\u201d Smith said the other day, over Zoom. \u201cI feel like I have a new lease on life.\u201d Wearing a blue shirt and AirPods, he was wide-eyed and cheery\u2014like Kimmy Schmidt if she had escaped from a right-wing news network rather than from a doomsday cult.", "Last month, Smith returned to television as an anchor for CNBC, the business-news network owned by NBCUniversal. (\u201cThey were into this novel concept of trying to do a newscast that\u2019s about the news and eliminating opinion from it,\u201d he explained.) His show, \u201cThe News with Shepard Smith,\u201d is just Shepard Smith delivering the news. \u201cWe feel kind of like explorers,\u201d he said, of his team, \u201cbut we\u2019re recharting territory from long ago.\u201d He was Zooming from what he called his \u201cCOVID office,\u201d at the CNBC headquarters, in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey\u2014a bare-bones space with Clorox wipes, Poland Spring water, and P.P.E. strewn about. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI came in here, and a couple of days later we were on the air.\u201d", "At CNBC, the big names are Mark Cuban (of \u201cShark Tank\u201d), Jim Cramer (of \u201cMad Money\u201d), and Jay Leno (of \u201cJay Leno\u2019s Garage\u201d). \u201cWe\u2019re mostly a business place,\u201d Smith said, \u201cand all of the discussion around here is about data and stocks and money. I didn\u2019t know how to fit in at first. I was trying to do that same thing for which I have muscle memory, in a place that has no muscle memory for the thing that I do.\u201d", "What are the advantages of the move, aside from not having to worry about his more popular colleagues roasting him on air? One is that Smith has a prime-time slot. (CNBC\u2019s past prime-time programs have included \u201cDeal or No Deal\u201d and \u201cMake Me a Millionaire Inventor.\u201d) But, as Smith pointed out, for many Americans, prime time is dinnertime. He imagines that many of his viewers watch his show while they eat, and so he has designed it accordingly. \u201cAs they\u2019re having their meal, we want to sort of present our metaphorical meal of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s the interesting stuff, the \u2018gee whiz\u2019 stuff. Here\u2019s the important stuff. Here\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s hard to swallow. Here\u2019s something kind of fun, maybe to share with your friends. And here\u2019s something kind of soothing, like a nice glass of wine. Maybe something inspiring, you know? We\u2019re all lacking for inspiration.\u201d (That night\u2019s headlines included \u201cFIRE FATIGUE,\u201d \u201cEXTREME WEATHER,\u201d and \u201cMAN FINDS GIANT JELLYFISH WHILE RUNNING ON FLORIDA BEACH.\u201d)", "The ratings haven\u2019t been so good. \u201cThe News with Shepard Smith\u201d is in last place for its cable-news time slot, garnering fewer than three hundred thousand nightly viewers. (\u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d recently broke a cable-news record, with an average nightly audience of 4.3 million.) \u201cWho knows if we\u2019ll ever get a boatload of viewers,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut I know that we\u2019re gonna put together something that, when the day is done, I\u2019m gonna sleep well.\u201d", "He doesn\u2019t watch his competitors\u2019 shows. \u201cI get really stressed out by all of the yelling at each other about how mad everyone is,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you\u2019re mad\u2014this is clear. You on the left and you on the right and those of you stuck inside, you\u2019re all angry. I get it. So everybody\u2019s about to vote and we\u2019ll move on. I like thinking about, Are our votes going to get counted? Is this going to be fair? We\u2019re diving into data on what\u2019s happening in Pennsylvania, what\u2019s happening in Texas right now, in Harris County. Can you vote? Is your vote gonna count? These are the things I care about. I don\u2019t care about people yelling at each other. I\u2019ve had enough. I can\u2019t take any more yelling.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Tyler Foggatt", "Tyler Foggat"], "keywords": ["stuff", "shep", "network", "know", "yelling", "heres", "shepard", "viewers", "start", "smiths", "smith", "place", "fresh", "vote"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
