Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recently filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a case containing the ominous words: \u201cPerhaps the court can heal itself before the public demands it be \u2018restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.\u2019\u201d And many on the left continue to demand the impeachment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh nearly a year after his confirmation.", "So the question is: How will the high court respond this term to the barrage of intimidation tactics?", "INDIANA AG CURTIS HILL: FETAL REMAINS CASE RAISES UNAVOIDABLE QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE'S SANCTITY", "To be sure, the stakes continue to be high. This term the court will be considering a host of critical legal questions, some of which are the subject of widespread national interest.", "Among the first up are three Title VII cases, which will be argued on Oct. 8: Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia; Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The court will consider whether the prohibition against employment discrimination \u201cbecause of ... sex\u201d in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes discrimination based on one\u2019s sexual orientation or status as transgender.", "After President Barack Obama\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decided to reinterpret the 50-year-old statute and expand its reach to include discrimination not based on a binary conception of gender, some courts of appeals followed along. But as Justice Antonin Scalia once wrote for the court, \u201cCongress ... does not ... hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d This case will be a bellwether as to the court\u2019s commitment to adhering to what was clearly the longstanding meaning of a landmark statute in the face of intense media pressure.", "Another case attracting national media attention is New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York \u2014 the most significant Second Amendment case since District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008. While Heller affirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual\u2019s right to possess firearms, the court will now consider whether it protects an individual\u2019s right to carry a firearm beyond one\u2019s home.", "As the Supreme Court begins its new term, it faces unprecedented political pressure and threats to its independence.", "Religious liberty is also on the docket in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. Last year, the Montana Supreme Court held that legislation which gave residents up to a $150 tax credit for contributions to a scholarship program violated the state\u2019s \u201cBlaine Amendment\u201d\u2014a state constitutional provision enacted in Montana and other states during the 19th century to prevent the federal government from funding Catholic schools.", "Thirty-seven states still have Blaine Amendments, but their constitutionality is in doubt after the court held in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer that the exclusion of churches from an otherwise neutral and secular aid program violates the First Amendment. (Linda Greenhouse, the New York Times Supreme Court reporter, has already launched her Espinoza campaign with a column last month entitled, \u201cReligious Crusaders at the Supreme Court\u2019s Gates.\u201d)", "Finally, the court will consider an important separation of powers case involving the Trump administration\u2019s decision to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. McAleenan v. Vidal; Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California; and Trump v. NAACP have been consolidated and will heard together on Nov. 12.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER", "After Congress failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform, Obama implemented the DACA program through executive action. In 2017, the Trump administration reversed the policy\u2014 again by executive action \u2014 after concluding that the policy was unlawful. (Recall that even Obama initially raised concerns about his administration going around Congress, saying in 2013: \u201cI\u2019m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system.\u201d)", "The DACA case raises fundamental questions about our nation\u2019s constitutional structure on two fronts: First, can the executive branch usurp Congress\u2019 power to make laws when Congress doesn\u2019t act? Second, when the Trump administration decided that it had an obligation to enforce our immigration laws, could federal courts prevent it from doing so? These are some of the important issues the Court will consider when it hears the DACA case.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "As the Supreme Court begins its term, anticipate the pressure to ramp up even more. We should expect to hear suggestions that the court is \u201cillegitimate\u201d if it doesn\u2019t succumb to coordinated left-wing PR campaigns, more calls for court packing, and perhaps even more attacks against Kavanaugh.", "And as the term presses on, we will see how the court responds to this unprecedented assault on its independence.", "CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CARRIE SEVERINO"]}
