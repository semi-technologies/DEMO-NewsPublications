Bryan Anselm for The New York Times The onslaught has been relentless. Late Wednesday in the United States, the daily death toll exceeded the record set just one week earlier, 2,885. By midnight it had climbed to 3,053, and total deaths since the coronavirus spread into the country at the beginning of the year and began laying siege had reached 289,529. If American hospitals were any guide, those numbers are unlikely to dip any time soon. Hospitals across the country are operating near or above capacity as they cope with a growing flood of Covid-19 cases. New data released this week by the Department of Health and Human Services offered a detailed geographic picture of the crisis, with more than a third of Americans living in areas where hospitals are running critically short of intensive care beds. With so many hospitals facing the same problems, the elasticity in the health care system is gone, and medical workers are being run ragged. \u201cThere is not a lot of wiggle room,\u201d said Loy Howard, president of the Tanner Health System. \u201cI have been doing this for 35 years, and I have not seen this kind of wear and tear on the staff.\u201d The five-hospital Tanner Health System near Atlanta expanded the number of critical care beds to 30, but its officials are still scrambling from before dawn to the end of the day. \u201cThe worry is,\u201d said Deborah Matthews, the chief nursing officer, \u201cwhat are you going to do with the 31st I. C.U. patient? What are you going to do with the next patient who needs to be on a ventilator? You have contingency plans for all of that, but you are just constantly thinking about those things.\u201d With no immediate relief in sight, the United States was bearing down on a ghastly mark likely days away: 300,000 deaths since the coronavirus outbreak began. The milestones are being toppled as U.S. officials race to approve and distribute a Covid-19 vaccine for Americans. Britain began vaccinating its own citizens this week, and Canada appears near to doing the same. But things have moved more slowly in a country still mired over a presidential election that took place more than a month ago, with many Republicans refusing to acknowledge the results and some working actively to undo them.

Jerome Delay/Associated Press Wealthy nations have a firm upper hand in securing a coronavirus vaccine compared with developing countries, a global coalition of organizations and activists warned on Wednesday. In about 70 developing countries, only one in 10 residents is expected to receive a Covid-19 vaccine within the next year, according to the People\u2019s Vaccine Alliance, which consists of organizations such as Amnesty International, Frontline AIDS, Global Justice Now and Oxfam. \u201cThe hoarding of vaccines actively undermines global efforts to ensure that everyone, everywhere can be protected from Covid-19,\u201d said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s head of economic and social justice. \u201cRich countries have clear human rights obligations not only to refrain from actions that could harm access to vaccines elsewhere, but also to cooperate and provide assistance to countries that need it.\u201d Rich countries representing 14 percent of the global population have bought over 50 percent of promising Covid-19 vaccines, according to data collected by Airfinity, a London-based software company tracking deals between countries and manufacturers. It looked at supply deals that included eight vaccine candidates in Phase 3 clinical trials. The alliance called on pharmaceutical companies along with researchers to \u201cshare the science, technological know-how and intellectual property\u201d of their vaccines. They also asked governments to ensure their Covid-19 vaccines are free to the public and equitably available. Recently, countries including South Africa and India have pushed for loosened restrictions on intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, proposing that the World Trade Organization end global enforcement of the rights in the interest of accessibility. \u201cGovernments must also ensure the pharmaceutical industry puts people\u2019s lives before profits,\u201d said Heidi Chow, a senior campaign and policy manager at Global Justice Now. Developing countries that the alliance focused on currently have access to the vaccine only through Covax, a global initiative to vaccinate much of the world population. (The United States declined to be a part of the effort.) The United Kingdom started vaccinations this week, after becoming the first Western country to authorize a Covid-19 vaccine. On Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates approved China\u2019s coronavirus vaccine, signaling a win for that country\u2019s vaccine ambitions. Canada approved Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine, which was also approved in Britain. Both Pfizer and Moderna have submitted their applications for emergency approvals the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and vaccinations in the U.S. could start before next month. However, the news of vaccination success in wealthy nations hasn\u2019t necessarily equated to access for developing countries: Wealthy nations have purchased enough doses to vaccinate their populations three times over by the end of 2021, the alliance said. \u201cBy buying up the vast majority of the world\u2019s vaccine supply, rich countries are in breach of their human rights obligations,\u201d Mr. Cockburn said. \u201cInstead, by working with others to share knowledge and scale up supply, they could help bring an end to the global Covid-19 crisis.\u201d", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "Unemployment claims rose sharply last week as economic crisis grinds on. A health care worker performed a nasal swab at a coronavirus testing site in Bloomington, Minn., last week. Economists fear that layoffs could begin to surge again. Credit... Tim Gruber for The New York Times Applications for jobless benefits resumed their upward march last week as the worsening pandemic continued to take a toll on the economy. More than 947,000 workers filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That was up nearly 229,000 from the week before, reversing a one-week dip that many economists attributed to the Thanksgiving holiday. Applications have now risen three times in the last four weeks, and are up nearly a quarter-million since the first week of November. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the week\u2019s figure was 853,000, an increase of 137,000. Nearly 428,000 applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program that covers freelancers, self-employed workers and others who don\u2019t qualify for regular state benefits. Unemployment filings have fallen greatly since last spring, when as many as six million people a week applied for state benefits. But progress had stalled even before the recent increases, and with Covid-19 cases soaring and states reimposing restrictions on consumers and businesses, economists fear that layoffs could surge again. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear the third wave of the pandemic is causing businesses to have to lay people off and consumers to cut back spending,\u201d said Daniel Zhao, senior economist for the career site Glassdoor. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re in for a rough winter economically.\u201d Jobless claims rose in nearly every state last week. In California, where the state has imposed strict new limits on many businesses, applications jumped by 47,000, more than reversing the state\u2019s Thanksgiving-week decline. The monthly jobs report released on Friday showed that hiring slowed sharply in early November and that some of the sectors most exposed to the pandemic, like restaurants and retailers, cut jobs for the first time since the spring. More up-to-date data from private sources suggests that the slowdown has continued or deepened since the November survey was conducted. \u201cEvery month, we\u2019re just seeing the pace of the recovery get slower and slower,\u201d said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist with the job site Indeed. Now, she said, the question is, \u201cAre we actually going to see it slide backward?\u201d Many economists say the recovery will continue to slow if the government does not provide more aid to households and businesses. After months of gridlock in Washington, prospects for a new round of federal help have grown in recent days, with congressional leaders from both parties signaling their openness to a compromise and the White House proposing its own $916 billion spending plan on Tuesday. But the two sides remain far apart on key issues. The stakes are particularly high for jobless workers depending on federal programs that have expanded and extended unemployment benefits during the pandemic. Those programs expire later this month, potentially leaving millions of families with no income during what epidemiologists warn could be some of the pandemic\u2019s worst months.", "The E.U. agency assessing coronavirus vaccines was hit by a cyberattack.

Remko De Waal/EPA, via Shutterstock The European Medicines Agency, the European Union\u2019s top drug regulator, whose approval is necessary for countries in the bloc to begin rolling out the coronavirus vaccine, has begun an investigation after it was hit by a cyberattack, it said on Wednesday. The agency, which is reviewing vaccine candidates, did not provide details about the target or the date of the attack. But shortly after the announcement, Pfizer and BioNTech said in their own statement that some documents related to the regulatory submission of their vaccine and which were hosted on a server of the European agency, had been \u201cunlawfully accessed.\u201d Pfizer and BioNTech said their systems had not been breached, and that no study participants appeared to have been identified as a result of the cyberattack. The breach comes at a time of heightened threats faced by pharmaceutical companies, health care institutions and agencies involved in the production, approval and distribution of the vaccine. Last week, IBM said it had detected a series of cyberattacks in September against companies involved in the distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the world and against a branch of the European Commission, the E.U.\u2019s executive arm. The European Medicines Agency is set to announce a decision on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by Dec. 29. Although each country in the bloc will be in charge of its own rollout, the agency\u2019s approval will pave the way for the largest vaccination campaign in the West, dwarfing the rollout that started this week in Britain and most likely posing more considerable logistical and security challenges. Canada approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday, becoming the second Western country to do so. Russia began the rollout of its own Sputnik 5 vaccine on Saturday. The European Medicines Agency didn\u2019t disclose who was behind the cyberattack, saying that it \u201ccannot provide additional details whilst the investigation is ongoing.\u201d Pfizer and BioNTech said in their statement that they were awaiting further information from the agency. Cybersecurity experts have said that only state actors could carry out such operations. Microsoft revealed last month that hacker groups backed by Russia and North Korea had targeted several vaccine makers in the United States, Canada and France, among other countries. \u201cThe intentions behind those attacks are to parasite Western efforts on the vaccine,\u201d said Julien Nocetti, a researcher at the French Institute of International Relations who studies cybersecurity with a focus on Russian activities. By breaking into the system of key actors involved in the vaccine or by disrupting distribution efforts, attackers could exact considerable damage, said Claire Zaboeva, a senior cyberthreat analyst at IBM\u2019s Security X-Force. Ms. Zaboeva said about the production and delivery of the vaccine: \u201cIf you manage to get the key to the whole kingdom, you have 500 options on the menu: collecting key timetables, which nations will get the vaccine, how it will get there, what companies will be associated with the delivery, or how it will be handled.\u201d", "Do you have questions about coronavirus tests?

Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For most of the year, South Korea has kept its coronavirus numbers so low it was the envy of the world. Now, the country is grappling with the most elusive wave of infections it has seen, just as other nations prepare to roll out vaccinations. South Korea\u2019s daily number of new cases was once as low as two per day. That number soared to\u200b 682 on Thursday, with health officials warning it could reach record highs in coming days. On Wednesday\u200b, 686 new cases were reported, the highest daily count since Feb. 29. \u201cWe must exert all we can, considering this our last hurdle to clear \u200bin our efforts to curb the coronavirus before vaccines and treatments come online,\u201d President Moon Jae-in said this week.

The country\u2019s struggle to contain the recent surge is a race against time. Mr. Moon\u2019s government announced this week that it had secured enough doses of coronavirus vaccines from companies like AstraZeneca and Pfizer to inoculate roughly 86 percent of the population, but that the first batch would not arrive until March. South Korea has been hit by four waves of infections since its first case was reported in January. But the latest is by far the \u200bhardest to control, health officials said. Previous waves included mass clusters that health officials were able to target and trace. The current wave spread through numerous small clusters that erupted in nursing homes, hospitals, saunas, bars, restaurants, music halls and factories, most of them in the Seoul metropolitan area, but also in towns farther away. Daily cases continue to rise despite tightened social-distancing \u200bguidelines and other measures. Na Seong-woong, a deputy commissioner of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, warned that the daily caseload could surpass 900 next week. \u201cWe are facing our biggest ever coronavirus crisis because the current wave is neither temporary nor regional, but steady and nationwide,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have one central cluster that we can shut down with a focused testing and isolating campaign, but it\u2019s popping up here and there and everywhere through our daily lives.\u201d", "For Germans, Christmas markets are a beloved fixture.

Library of Congress, via Associated Press The influenza pandemic of 1918-19, in which millions of Americans were sickened and 675,000 died, seemed to roll across the United States in waves, much like the coronavirus today. The winter holidays in 1918 were marked by grievous loss, and came during a relative lull after the deadliest wave, in the fall. Another, smaller surge would peak shortly after New Year\u2019s Day. But the national conversation around private family gatherings appeared to have been less charged in 1918 than it is today, as many weary from months of restrictions bristle at guidance from health agencies to stay home. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people lost loved ones,\u201d said J.
