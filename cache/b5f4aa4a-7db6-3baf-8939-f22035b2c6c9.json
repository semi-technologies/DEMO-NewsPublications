Dissenting from a decision that upended a 40-year-old rule involving out-of-state lawsuits, Justice Breyer chastised his conservative colleagues for \u201csurrender[ing] to the temptation\u201d of overruling a precedent not because it has proved to be unworkable but simply because five justices happen to disagree with it. \u201cToday\u2019s decision\u201d, he wrote, \u201ccan only cause one to wonder which cases the court will overrule next\u201d. Several vulnerable precedents may have been on Justice Breyer\u2019s mind, but his lone citation in the closing paragraph\u2014to Planned Parenthood v Casey, the 1992 case reaffirming Roe v Wade\u2014suggested that his most profound worry involves the future of abortion rights.", "That concern took on new urgency on October 4th when the Supreme Court announced it would hear its first abortion case since Donald Trump\u2019s two appointees\u2014Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh\u2014built a new conservative majority. Mr Trump campaigned on the promise of selecting justices who would \u201cautomatically\u201d overrule Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that first recognised a right to abortion prior to fetal viability. The new case, June Medical Services v Gee, asks whether Louisiana may require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital no farther than 30 miles from the abortion facility. This does not tee up a frontal assault on Roe. It heralds, instead, a threat to abortion access that could more subtly whittle away at the right Roe protects.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "When the Supreme Court reviews June Medical Services, it will revisist a recent case involving the regulation of abortion clinics: Whole Woman\u2019s Health v Hellerstedt, a 2016 decision striking down a Texas law that, like Louisiana\u2019s, required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The court found that the regulation would have shuttered half of Texas\u2019s 40 abortion clinics, posing \u201ca substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions\u201d, while providing \u201cfew, if any, health benefits\u201d. With \u201cnothing\u201d to suggest that Texas\u2019s rules \u201cwould have helped even one woman obtain better treatment\u201d, the majority pronounced the regulation an unconstitutional \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s right to choose.", "The 5-3 decision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health did not deter several states from attempting to enforce similar regulations\u2014known to their detractors as Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP, laws. But in 2017, a district-court judge found Louisiana\u2019s law \u201cunconstitutional on its face\u201d under Casey and Whole Woman\u2019s Health. Any \u201cmarginal health benefits\u201d the regulation might bring \u201cwould be dramatically outweighed by the obstacles the restriction erects to women\u2019s access to their constitutional right to abortion\u201d. A panel of the conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 2-1 vote, reversed this decision in 2018. Though the requirement in Louisiana was identical to the Texas regulation struck down in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, the impact on women in Louisiana was \u201cdramatically less\u201d, the Fifth Circuit held, and passed constitutional muster.", "In February, the Supreme Court surprised some observers by blocking Louisiana\u2019s abortion-clinic regulation from taking effect. The vote was 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the liberal justices to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling. The chief\u2019s defection from his conservative colleagues was significant but not momentous: the decision was procedural and temporary. Chief Justice Roberts has otherwise been a consistent vote to limit abortion rights, including in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, when he joined Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s dissent finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of dramatically reduced abortion access as a result of the regulations were just \u201ccrude inferences\u201d. With four justices seemingly ready to overturn Whole Woman\u2019s Health just three years after it was decided and four justices fully committed to the ruling, all eyes are on Chief Justice Roberts.", "When June Medical Services comes up for argument in early 2020, with a decision expected by the end of June, the chief, and thus the court, could go in a few directions. Chief Justice Roberts could rejoin his conservative brethren, let Louisiana impose the clinic regulations and toss Whole Woman\u2019s Health. He could vote again with the liberals, strike down Louisiana's law and affirm the 2016 precedent. Or, perhaps most likely, he could try to stake out a middle ground that vindicates the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view of the case while only implicitly gutting Whole Woman\u2019s Health. Such a tack would draw on Justice Brett Kavanaugh's characterisation of the case as \u201cintensely factual\u201d in an opinion he penned in February. Roberts and his colleagues could leave Whole Woman Health\u2019s new spin on the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard untouched while claiming that Louisiana\u2019s regulations satisfy it. That claim will be tough to justify: the rules would leave only one functioning abortion clinic in the state, with little to no benefit for women's health. But the chief might see such a nuanced approach as the best course for tamping down passions over America\u2019s most divisive issue\u2014and the politics of the judiciary\u2014just months before voters choose the next president."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/10/04/the-supreme-court-will-review-abortion-clinic-rules-in-louisiana", "title": "The Supreme Court will review abortion-clinic rules in Louisiana", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["abortion", "v", "decision", "court", "regulation", "health", "louisiana", "justice", "review", "supreme", "abortionclinic", "rules", "womans", "case", "chief"]}
