Included in their number were members of the Ku Klux Klan and Knights of the White Camelia, both terrorist groups devoted to maintaining white rule across the American South. They were coming to seize the courthouse, then occupied by black and white Republicans who claimed victory in a disputed election the year before (Republicans were the party of Abraham Lincoln and emancipation). Republicans called on their supporters, most of whom in Colfax were black, to defend them.", "The invaders were better armed, and laid down an enfilade of cannon fire. Some of the defenders fled. They were pursued and shot to death. Around 70 retreated into the courthouse, which the whites set ablaze. The courthouse\u2019s defenders extended from a window the sleeve of a shirt as a white flag. Emerging unarmed, 37 were taken prisoner. After dark, they and other prisoners were marched two-by-two away from the courthouse, told they were going to be set free. They too were shot, and left unburied for days. As many as 150 black Louisianans died that day.", "The Colfax Massacre, as it came to be known, was not an isolated incident. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, racist terrorism swept across the South, targeting newly freed black Southerners and the whites believed to be helping them. This violence hastened the end of Reconstruction. Most historians define the period as beginning with the enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, before the end of the civil war, and ending when Rutherford Hayes withdrew federal support in 1877 as part of a political bargain that put him in the White House.", "Southern trees bear a strange fruit", "Reconstruction began with unbridled enthusiasm among those who saw, in the defeat of the Confederacy and the end of slavery, a chance to remake the South, and compel America to live up to the promise of its founding documents. It ended in cowardice and compromise. Hayes\u2019s decision led to almost a century of white-supremacist rule across the South, which only began to crumble in the mid-20th century, as civil-rights activists won court cases and pressured Congress and the president to pass and enforce legislation.", "Reconstruction tends to get less attention than other foundational periods in American history, such as the founding and the civil war. Perhaps that is because, as an attempt to create an enduring multiracial democracy, it failed. But in the three Reconstruction amendments, and more broadly in the idea that the federal government should act as a guarantor of individual liberties, it planted the seeds of such a democracy. For that reason it remains central to American politics.", "Reconstruction was a deeply contested undertaking. For lawmakers and elected officials, it was an attempt to answer a question that neither the constitution nor American history had encompassed. Eleven states\u2014in order of their secession, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee\u2014seceded from and waged war against the United States. They were defeated. On what terms, how and when should they be readmitted to the Union?", "Moderate Republicans favoured a quick reconciliation. Though Lincoln himself had a personal aversion to slavery, his principal interest as president was not ensuring equal rights for all Americans; it was winning the civil war and keeping the United States together. As he wrote to Horace Greeley, a publisher, in 1862, \u201cIf I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it...What I do about slavery, and the coloured race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union.\u201d", "Many abolitionists\u2014among them Frederick Douglass, born enslaved in Maryland and by the 1860s one of America\u2019s most celebrated authors and orators\u2014recognised this position as untenable. To Douglass, \u201cthe very stomach of this rebellion is the Negro in the condition of a slave.\u201d He wanted enslaved Americans not just freed, but armed and trained to fight for the Union.", "Blood on the leaves and blood at the root", "But Lincoln came to emancipation slowly, led by events more than principle. The border states (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri and West Virginia after its creation in 1863) declined his entreaties for gradual emancipation backed by compensation to slave owners. His push to send African-Americans to Liberia, the Caribbean or Central America found few takers.", "As the war progressed, the Union\u2019s need for soldiers grew. Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation not only freed the enslaved, it also welcomed them into the army. Abolitionists recruited free African-Americans in the North, and in the South the Union\u2019s fighting forces included the formerly enslaved. According to Eric Foner, a historian, by the war\u2019s end 180,000 African-Americans had served in the Union Army.", "Emancipation also bound the Union\u2019s success to slavery\u2019s demise. It seems obvious today that the two were always linked. After all, Alexander Stephens, the Confederacy\u2019s vice-president, called slavery the \u201cnatural and normal condition\u201d of \u201cthe Negro,\u201d who \u201cis not equal to the white man\u201d. But, as Lincoln\u2019s vacillation demonstrates, it was then not so clear, and many hoped for some sort of political reconciliation between northern and southern states under which slavery would somehow naturally die out.", "Almost a year after the Emancipation Proclamation took effect, Lincoln released his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction. This moderate plan promised readmission to Confederate states once 10% of their voters accepted abolition and swore loyalty to the Union. Once readmitted, states could draft new constitutions, form new governments and send federal representatives to Washington, DC .", "The radical wing of Lincoln\u2019s party abhorred the plan. Wendell Phillips, an abolitionist, said that it \u201cfrees the slave and ignores the Negro\u201d, meaning that it made no provisions to aid the formerly enslaved, and said nothing about suffrage. But the border states also bristled; as Mr Foner notes, some Marylanders \u201cfelt compelled to deny that voting for abolition implied \u2018any sympathy with Negro equality\u2019\u201d. This was not unusual; for many, abolition did not entail a belief in actual racial equality, just opposition to slavery.", "Radical Republicans hoped that Andrew Johnson, who ascended to the presidency after Lincoln\u2019s assassination in 1865, would hew more closely to their view that Reconstruction required more than just emancipation. They were disappointed. Johnson, a Democrat whom Lincoln made his running-mate on a unity ticket, disliked \u201cslaveocracy\u201d. He was also a bigot and a poor politician, and led his party to defeat in the elections of 1866 and 1867.", "Though Radicals never made up a congressional majority, they held strong convictions and voted together while others wavered. They demanded full civil rights for freedmen, which few moderate Republicans did, and opposed compensating slaveholders. They also opposed any accommodation to slavery, such as the measures that would have preserved the Union at the cost of allowing slavery in newly admitted states.", "After the 1867 elections, with Johnson weakened and Republicans holding a congressional majority, the Radicals\u2019 solidarity put them in charge of Reconstruction policy. The most prominent among them was Thaddeus Stevens, a congressman from Pennsylvania. He saw the former Confederacy as conquered territory and believed \u201cthe whole fabric of southern society must be changed, and never can it be done if this opportunity is lost.\u201d The Radicals divided the South into five military districts. They required the states to write new constitutions; ratify the 14th amendment, which granted citizenship to anyone born on American soil or naturalised in the United States; and allow black men to vote.", "In the South, black political mobilisation was already under way, having begun before the war\u2019s end. During Reconstruction, black electoral turnout often approached 90%. Former Confederate states elected over 2,000 black state and local officials and 185 black federal elected officials, including two senators from Mississippi (Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce) and 14 members of Congress, with the largest number coming from South Carolina. Louisiana\u2019s first and still only black governor, P.B.S. Pinchback, took office in 1872.", "African-Americans in the South did not only vote for and seek office. Alongside white Republicans, they also rewrote their state constitutions, which as well as doing away with racially discriminatory laws also expanded state responsibility and civil liberties. Some established the South\u2019s first state-funded schools and made attendance compulsory. Others opened state-run orphanages and asylums, reduced the number of crimes punishable by death, recognised a wife\u2019s property rights independent of her husband and, in one state, authorised divorce.", "The constitutional conventions and sizeable number of black elected officials were the fruits of rising black political mobilisation. Much like the civil-rights activists of the mid-20th century, they advocated for equal rights, and called on America to live up to its stated ideals. As one Alabama convention proclaimed, \u201cWe claim exactly the same rights, privileges and immunities as are enjoyed by white men...The law no longer knows white nor black, but simply men.\u201d", "Pastoral scene of the gallant South", "Northerners, both black and white, came south to organise, teach and help. Many of the newly emancipated joined branches of the Union League, a Republican-affiliated organisation. Others formed and joined organisations of their own. They built schools and churches, and advocated for land reform. As W.E.B. Du Bois, a sociologist and civil-rights activist, noted in his magisterial \u201cBlack Reconstruction in America\u201d, \u201cBlack folk wanted two things\u2014first, land which they could own and work for their own crops...In addition to that, they wanted to know...They were consumed with curiosity at the meaning of the world.\u201d", "Freedmen\u2019s desire for land made sense. They and their families had cleared and worked it without recompense, giving them a moral claim, and there was plenty of it. Much of the South was sparsely populated, and the war left many planters devastated and without the free labour that built their wealth. Mississippi and Louisiana auctioned off land in small parcels. But most states did little.", "The new constitutions did not resolve every question that they raised. Most took no position on whether state-run schools should be integrated, though in every state, African-Americans opposed separating black and white pupils into different schools. Some used racially neutral language to facilitate discrimination. Georgia required jurors to be \u201cworthy and intelligent\u201d\u2014subjective terms that permitted local officials to bar African-Americans from juries. This pattern\u2014broad agreement on principles, but backsliding over implementation\u2014was a hint of the problems to come.", "Recalcitrant white Southerners also fought against Reconstruction in three main ways. First, they aligned with moderate Republicans, who were less insistent on sweeping social changes than the Radicals. This cleaved southern Republicans in two camps, leaving the Radicals isolated, and brought Democrat-backed moderates into power across much of the South in the 1860s. And then, in the aftermath of the war, southern legislatures passed an array of \u201cBlack Codes\u201d that curtailed freedom for the newly emancipated. These codes authorised arrest and forced labour for pseudo-crimes such as \u201cvagrancy\u201d and \u201cmalicious mischief\u201d. Mississippi required African-Americans to hold written proof of employment for the year. Any worker who left his employer before year\u2019s end would forfeit wages and be subject to arrest. South Carolina barred African-Americans from any job other than farmer or servant unless they paid a \u201ctax\u201d of up to $100 (over $1,600 today). In both cases these Black Codes did not take effect\u2014the robust federal presence imposed by the Radicals and protests from Congress prevented it. But they indicated the depth of southern white opposition to racial equality, presaging the practices that came to be known as \u201cJim Crow\u201d laws. White Southerners also embarked on a campaign of racist terrorism, led by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Nowhere in the South did African-Americans escape terror\u2019s shadow. The terrorists were not, as legend maintained for decades, poor, uneducated whites, but as a newspaper editor from North Carolina remarked, \u201cmen of property [and] respectable citizens\u201d. State and local governments did little to stop the violence, which made them look weak and ineffective\u2014a shared goal of the terrorists and the Democrats. The elections of 1872 returned Republicans to power in the White House and across much of the South. But Radical power was waning. Soon after winning re-election, President Ulysses Grant\u2019s support for their policies grew tepid. In the next presidential election, Reconstruction was not part of Republicans\u2019 platform; their candidate, Rutherford Hayes, promised to restore \u201chonest and capable local self-government\u201d to the South if elected. The threat of terrorism left many southern Republicans, as one from Mississippi complained, feeling \u201chelpless and unable to organise\u201d.", "Hayes\u2019s opponent was Samuel Tilden, the Democratic governor of New York, who like Hayes was not terribly popular. The election\u2019s results were disputed, marred by widespread violence and accusations of corruption. While Congress set up a commission to settle the dispute, Hayes\u2019s moderate Republican allies began negotiations with Southern Democrats. The two sides struck a bargain, the terms of which remain unknown, but which resulted in Hayes\u2019s inauguration, and an end to federal support for Reconstruction. This left the South, as a black Louisianan noted, in \u201cthe hands of the very men that held us as slaves\u201d.", "Here is a strange and bitter crop", "Many black Southerners feared that \u201cRedemption\u201d, as whites called the end of Reconstruction, would lead to their re-enslavement. The 13th amendment, which outlawed slavery, prevented that\u2014but only just. Men convicted of the flimsiest of crimes were leased to agricultural and industrial projects and forced to work without pay. Debt peonage kept rural African-American families bound to planters and merchants.", "The 15th amendment barred explicitly denying black people the right to vote. Yet literacy requirements or poll taxes were often imposed in a racist way. An African-American could be deemed unfit to vote, for instance, if he failed to tell a white county clerk how many bubbles were in a bar of soap. When such tests failed, whites could always resort to violence without fear of conviction by all-white juries. By the mid-20th century, just 7% of Mississippi\u2019s black adult population was registered to vote.", "Denial of the franchise led to a decline in the number of black officials. By the turn of the 20th century, Congress had just one black member: George Henry White of North Carolina, who left office in 1901 after his state, like the rest of the South, enacted laws restricting black suffrage. After Blanche Bruce of Mississippi left office in 1881, 86 years would pass before the next African-American\u2014Edward Brooke of Massachusetts\u2014served in the Senate. Not until 2013 would two elected African-Americans (Tim Scott of South Carolina and Cory Booker of New Jersey) serve in the Senate together. After John Lynch lost in 1882, it took almost a century for Mississippi, America\u2019s blackest state by share of population, to elect another black congressman, Mike Espy. After P.B.S. Pinchback left office in 1873, America would not see another black governor until 1990 when Virginians elected Douglas Wilder.", "For years, the prevailing historical interpretation of Reconstruction\u2014known as the Dunning School, after William Dunning, a professor who propounded it in the early 20th century\u2014argued that it failed because black Southerners, in his words, \u201cexercised an influence in political affairs out of all relation to their intelligence\u201d. In this view, slavery was not an inexcusable evil and a betrayal of America\u2019s founding ideals, but \u201ca modus vivendi through which social life was possible\u2026[between] two races so distinct in their characteristics as to render coalescence impossible.\u201d", "By placing the blame for Reconstruction\u2019s failure on African-Americans, the Dunning School justified Jim Crow and legal segregation. It also undergirded the \u201cLost Cause\u201d mythology propounded by the defeated South, which argued that it waged a defensive struggle against a tyrannical invader rather than an offensive war (the South fired the civil war\u2019s first shot) for the right to enslave others. Part of the cost of reconciliation was that in the decades immediately following Reconstruction\u2019s end, the civil war came to be seen as a battle between equally brave soldiers now at peace with each other, rather than, as Douglass wrote, \u201ca contest of civilisation against barbarism\u201d.", "Du Bois\u2019s study of Reconstruction, published in 1935, took aim at the Dunning School. Du Bois argued that Republicans and black Southerners laid the groundwork for a new and more activist conception of the state. They were the principal agents, politically and intellectually, of their own liberation. It was not their corruption or unpreparedness that condemned Reconstruction; it was implacable white opposition to democracy and devotion to racist rule backed by violence. That view, built upon by Mr Foner and others, now predominates.", "Even so, some of the battle lines drawn by Reconstruction remain. President Donald Trump\u2019s exploitation of white racial grievance echoes that of the Redeemers, as does his fondness for Confederate iconography. Some on the right, including Mr Trump, oppose birthright citizenship. Revanchist white Southerners spent a century keeping African-Americans from voting, in defiance of the 15th amendment; as recently as 2013, Republicans in North Carolina tried to pass a voter ID law that \u201ctarget[ed] African-Americans with almost surgical precision\u201d, in the words of the judge who struck it down.", "Although Reconstruction was a failure, it shaped the country in positive ways. After the civil war ended, the newly emancipated formed their own political organisations and churches\u2014the latter of which would come to play a central role in the civil-rights movement of the mid-20th century and beyond. States such as Georgia, which had no state-funded school system before Reconstruction, would retain it after Redemption, though not until 1954 would the Supreme Court bar racial segregation in schools. The 14th amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause\u2014which forbids \u201cany State [from denying] to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws\u201d\u2014has been used to abolish segregated schools, anti-miscegenation rules and other racist laws.", "Still, anyone who believes in American ideals will find it difficult to ponder Reconstruction\u2019s unfulfilled promise without grief and anger. The lament with which Du Bois ends his masterpiece remains sadly true today: \u201cIf the Reconstruction of the Southern states, from slavery to free labour, from aristocracy to industrial democracy, had been conceived as a major national programme of America, whose accomplishment at any price was well worth the effort, we should be living today in a different world.\u201d \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["white", "republicans", "state", "lines", "reshaped", "black", "today", "states", "reconstruction", "africanamericans", "slavery", "south", "war", "america", "contested"], "pubDate": "2020-12-19T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
