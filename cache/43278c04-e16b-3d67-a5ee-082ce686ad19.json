Before we leave, though\u2014I noticed that you checked your phone quite a few times already, as we\u2019ve been talking. No, don\u2019t apologize! While you\u2019re around our child, please use your phone all you want. We\u2019re raising our son to get as much screen time as possible. I mean, we\u2019re living in a world where screens are ubiquitous, and you can\u2019t prepare a child for that early enough.", "You have to watch out for this one, because he loves getting into everything. And, when he does, please redirect him to one of the iPads. Especially when he takes out the toy blocks or asks you to read him one of those board books that someone bought for him. I know it\u2019s tempting to make funny faces at him and play with him, but don\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s only going to encourage him to seek attention from people instead of the many digital devices that we have stationed around the apartment.", "Just show him things on the Internet that you like to mindlessly waste time on\u2014that way, you\u2019ll be modelling behavior that we want him to mimic. If you run out of things to show him, simply put on YouTube and let the site cue up whatever\u2019s next. After all, growing children need to practice passively letting nihilistic algorithms shape their thinking.", "If he seems too needy, and is reaching out to you a lot, that\u2019s just him seeking acknowledgement from another human that we all share a physical reality. When he does that, try putting this pane of glass in front of you. That way, he\u2019ll see you as a two-dimensional figure instead of as an actual person in the room with him. It\u2019ll help him associate screens with the contact that he craves. We call this the \u201csoulless window,\u201d and we keep a few of them in every room.", "After dinner, can you make sure that he gets in his swiping exercise? We want to build up his swiping endurance so that something as minor as finger-muscle fatigue doesn\u2019t deter him from constantly scrolling. If all goes as planned, his hands should nearly be flippers by the time he\u2019s five years old.", "Bedtime is 7 P.M., which is not the time he should start sleeping but rather the time by which he should be lying in bed looking at an iPhone. It\u2019s never too early to be kept awake by a blue rectangle. Since this technology didn\u2019t exist when I was a kid, he\u2019s going to get the head start at sleep deprivation that I never had. Who knows, maybe by the time he\u2019s my age, he\u2019ll be an expert at losing sleep. A parent can only hope!", "Now, I know how all this must sound\u2014like we are overachievers. Well, let me tell you something. Around the time we got pregnant, I learned that Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, limits how often his kids use their iPhones. That\u2019s when it dawned on me: my child has the chance to get ahead of Tim Cook\u2019s children. So, even though this little guy was born before we could install the in-utero tablet prototype that we were developing (our doctor has deemed it \u201cunsafe and worrisome\u201d), he\u2019s on track to outpace Tim Cook\u2019s kids in cumulative screen time by the time he\u2019s in kindergarten. Who says meritocracy is dead?", "O.K., we\u2019ve got to go. If you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to be in touch\u2014we\u2019ll just be a few blocks away, crying in our car for the next four hours. So good to finally get a night out of the house!"], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/were-raising-our-child-to-get-plenty-of-screen-time", "keywords": ["way", "things", "start", "raising", "swiping", "tell", "plenty", "weve", "hes", "screen", "child", "thats", "tim"], "summary": "Before we leave, though\u2014I noticed that you checked your phone quite a few times already, as we\u2019ve been talking.\nWhile you\u2019re around our child, please use your phone all you want.\nWe\u2019re raising our son to get as much screen time as possible.\nI mean, we\u2019re living in a world where screens are ubiquitous, and you can\u2019t prepare a child for that early enough.\nThat\u2019s when it dawned on me: my child has the chance to get ahead of Tim Cook\u2019s children.", "authors": ["David Guzman", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Adam Entous", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "Amy Hwang", "Sam Spero"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "id": "43278c04-e16b-3d67-a5ee-082ce686ad19"}
