(Can that really be the name? I do hope so.) In order to receive it, she must go to England, but she won\u2019t fly. Instead, she condescends to travel by water, roughing it in a two-story suite on the Queen Mary 2, from New York to Southampton. She is accompanied by her nephew, Tyler (Lucas Hedges), plus two old friends of hers from college, Susan (Dianne Wiest) and Roberta (Candice Bergen). One is an advocate for imprisoned women, in Seattle; the other sells lingerie in Dallas. Alice hasn\u2019t seen either of them in decades, so now is a chance to catch up. Such is the quartet of characters on whom this movie turns. It should be called \u201cOcean\u2019s Four.\u201d", "One disappointment is that all of them, arriving on board, are politely conducted to their cabins. Boring! As any follower of the Marx Brothers can tell you, on the strength of \u201cMonkey Business\u201d (1931), the best\u2014and certainly the most fragrant\u2014means of embarking on a luxury liner is to stow away in a barrel marked \u201cKippered Herring.\u201d There is a secret passenger in the new film, named Karen (Gemma Chan), but the only person she\u2019s hiding from is Alice, who, en voyage, will be working on the manuscript of a new book. It\u2019s rumored to be a sequel to one of her earlier successes, and Karen, having recently become Alice\u2019s literary agent, yearns to discover what it\u2019s about, and to chivvy along the creative process. This involves recruiting Tyler to spy on his aunt and to report back, the sole result being that Tyler starts to fall in love with her. With Karen, that is, not with his aunt. That would be weird.", "To be honest, Karen\u2019s part in the story is slight to the point of absurdity, and there\u2019s something equally thin in Alice\u2019s motives. If the plan was to revisit the past with her sisterly pals, why does she scarcely make contact with them, except at dinner? \u201cIt\u2019s really important that I know something of their state of mind,\u201d she says to Tyler, thus burdening the poor boy with yet more espionage, but why that\u2019s important to her remains obscure, and, indeed, the first half of \u201cLet Them All Talk\u201d is barely there as a movie. Soderbergh seems to be sketching out ideas for a plot, and gingerly feeling his way into its moral possibilities, as if he were clinging to a rail, beside a heaving sea. And yet the Atlantic stays calm.", "Most of the action was filmed on the Queen Mary 2, during a crossing in August, 2019, and you\u2019re never entirely sure to what extent the resident mortals are aware of the stars who have descended among them. Does the helpful member of the ship\u2019s crew, giving directions to a lost and elegant lady, even realize that she is in the frame with Meryl Streep? \u201cLet Them All Talk\u201d belongs to the gang of speedy, shot-from-the-hip movies\u2014like \u201cBubble\u201d (2005), \u201cUnsane\u201d (2018), and \u201cHigh Flying Bird\u201d (2019)\u2014that Soderbergh likes to fire off now and then, using the lightest and least obtrusive tools for the job. One of his legacies will be the encouragement of younger filmmakers, who will watch his no-frills ventures and say to themselves, \u201cWe may not have a Streep, but we\u2019ve got a coffee machine, a script, and an iPhone 12. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d", "The hardest thing to replicate, for any novice, will be the surreptitious ease with which, in the latest film, Soderbergh shifts gear. Gradually, against all expectation, we find ourselves in a serious and somewhat Jamesian drama, strewn with riddles. Who is the fellow who, observed by Tyler, emerges from Alice\u2019s room every morning? Could Susan be the first person on record to discuss her distant sexual history while playing Monopoly and Scrabble, and, if so, does a threesome count as a triple-word score? And what is Roberta\u2019s beef? The movie treats her ungallantly, I reckon, looking down on her as a gold-digger and an emotional desperado, yet there is genuine force when she suddenly says, of Alice, \u201cI am convinced she asked me on this trip to find out what happened to me after my divorce. She wants to write about it as a sequel to her fucking book.\u201d Ah, that old lament. Despite protestations to the contrary, every novel is a roman \u00e0 clef, for readers who are privately acquainted with the novelist. Most of them, moreover, persuade themselves that they are the keys that fit.", "But wait. Also aboard is another novelist, a mystery-monger named Kelvin Kranz (Dan Algrant), who outsells Alice, many times over. Needless to say, she deems herself his artistic superior, and the film is worth seeing for a delicious moment of pure Streepery, when Alice and Kelvin meet in the dining room. She asks him, \u201cHow long does it take you to write one of your\u201d\u2014she flutters her fingers, as if brushing off dirt\u2014\u201cyour books?\u201d Three or four months, he replies. \u201cOh, that\u2019s longer than I thought!\u201d she says. Ouch. The joke\u2019s on her, though, for Kelvin is a gentlemanly soul, who admires Alice\u2019s work, and it\u2019s gratifying to see Susan curled up in bed with one of his best-sellers. What I longed for was a closeup of Alice, too, sneakily plucking \u201cFugue State,\u201d \u201cBoiling Point,\u201d or another gripping Kranz from the shelves of the ship\u2019s library and smuggling it to her room. Imagine her lapping up every word, her face aglow with envy, snobbery, thrills, and guilt. Sadly, Soderbergh can\u2019t bring himself to take that illuminating step.", "One mystery that even Kranz couldn\u2019t solve is: Where\u2019s Elvis Costello? \u201cLet Them All Talk\u201d is the opening number, pumping and brassy, on his 1983 album, \u201cPunch the Clock.\u201d In the film, however, we never hear it. (The succeeding track, \u201cEvery Day I Write the Book,\u201d which may be the best song ever written about writing, would also be a nice fit for this movie.) Instead, the score is by Thomas Newman, whose jazz compositions are, I guess, better suited to Soderbergh\u2019s narrative riffs. Much of the tale has a noodling and speculative air, and, if you\u2019re braced for shipboard shenanigans, as in \u201cThe Lady Eve\u201d (1941), forget it; the romance between Karen and Tyler is a nonstarter. Oddest of all is the fact that, when Alice, as requested, delivers a public lecture to her fellow-passengers, she addresses her thoughts\u2014\u201cWhat a miracle it is that consciousness emerged,\u201d and so on\u2014to a full house. Give me a break. I\u2019ve been on the Queen Mary 2, from America to England, and, believe me, the folks on that noble vessel are in no mood for miraculous consciousness. They want to shop.", "For fuchsia\u2019s sake, the heroine of \u201cI\u2019m Your Woman,\u201d Jean (Rachel Brosnahan), lounges around in a gauzy peignoir trimmed with fur. It still has the sales tag attached, suggesting that it was stolen rather than bought. Unhappy, bored, and home alone, Jean has tried in vain to have children\u2014a hole in her life that is repaired, without warning, when her husband, Eddie (Bill Heck), returns one day with a baby. Where it hails from, and who its parents are, Lord knows; nonetheless, what a thoughtful gift. Jean names it Harry.", "Soon afterward, in a further surprising development, Jean is hustled out of the house and compelled to go on the run. Eddie is a crook, he\u2019s messed up, and now somebody\u2019s seeking revenge on him and his loved ones. Typically, though, he\u2019s not around, and so the fleeing Jean is attended by a guy named Cal (Arinz\u00e9 Kene)\u2014a placid and capable sort, who drives her and Harry to a safe location and leaves them there, with plenty of diapers, food, and formula. More loneliness ensues. The movie, which is directed by Julia Hart, may have the outline of a thriller, but the gaps are filled with waiting.", "The time is the nineteen-seventies B.C.\u2014before cell phones, that is. (The ubiquity of them, I\u2019d argue, has proved fatal to the crime film; information can now be instantly shared rather than being withheld in the interests of suspense or lost because of a missed call.) The cars of the period are like whales on wheels, lumbering and wallowing along in the course of a chase. There\u2019s also a splendid, disco-driven sequence at a club, where the beat is interrupted by gunfire. Jean, clad in a glittering jumpsuit, takes refuge in one of the club\u2019s phone booths, and we glimpse the chaos from her point of view, as the customers race past in a terrified stampede.", "\u201cI\u2019m Your Woman\u201d needs these dynamic interludes, because the rest of it, alas, feels dangerously numb. Remember the rollicking tone of \u201cRaising Arizona\u201d (1987), another kid-kidnapping saga? Well, swing to the opposite extreme and you come to Hart\u2019s movie, where nobody rollicks at all. Conversation is pause-heavy; smiles are fleeting and tight with anxiety; the plot is a knot. True, there\u2019s a smoothly controlled performance from Marsha Stephanie Blake as Teri, who also has Eddie troubles. But why is everyone so scared of Eddie, anyway? Is he really Mr. Big? We meet him only briefly, but he strikes me as Mr. Medium-Sized Jerk. Jean and Teri should be their own women, and belong to nobody else. \u2666"], "authors": ["Anthony Lane", "Anthony Lan"], "keywords": ["film", "eddie", "meryl", "tyler", "let", "jean", "talk", "soderbergh", "seas", "streep", "alice", "high", "karen", "movie"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
