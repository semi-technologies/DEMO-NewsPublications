I know, it\u2019s crazy!", "Are you on the app where girls have to send the initial message, and then guys are only allowed to choose from twenty preapproved words for the first hour? That way they can\u2019t say anything overtly sexual or offensive until after you\u2019ve spent an hour talking to them. My friend Amanda met her boyfriend on it.", "I get it\u2014it\u2019s tough out there. Dating seems so different now from the way it was when I was doing it. I was just reading somewhere that young people don\u2019t even go on real dates anymore. They just \u201cslide\u201d into one another\u2019s Blue Apron accounts, and if you \u201clike\u201d the same recipes as someone else then that person gets delivered to your house with your next meal-prep box. It sounds convenient. But I wouldn\u2019t know\u2014I\u2019ve been with Seth for seven years, and we share a toothbrush!", "I also heard that millennials aren\u2019t having sex as much. Like, kids don\u2019t \u201chook up\u201d anymore\u2014now they just do this thing where they lie down and kind of mash their elbows and legs together in an intertwined position and stay like that. Like eagle pose in yoga, but between two bodies? I think it started with the Amish.", "It\u2019s so funny\u2014yesterday, Seth thought I said \u201cSex?\u201d and he got all excited, but I was actually saying \u201cSeth?\u201d because I was going to say, \u201cSeth? Next time you dock the robot vacuum, can you make sure it actually docks? Because I went to use it and it hadn\u2019t been properly charged, so I couldn\u2019t. Thanks, sweetie.\u201d", "Oh! Have you heard about the plant dating app? It\u2019s, like, you earn a point every time you match with a person, and when you get enough points it reminds you when to water your plants. But it lets you see new guys only on days when you haven\u2019t watered your succulents, I think. I tried to get my single friend Eileen to let me swipe as her the other day, but I accidentally turned her into a monstera plant. And I\u2019ll never remember to water her. I\u2019d forget my head if it weren\u2019t for Seth. Sorry, Eileen!", "What\u2019s the name of that other app\u2014the one where if someone doesn\u2019t respond to your message a freelance contract killer goes to his house and kills him for you? I forget the name, but, like, thank you, gig economy, am I right? LOL.", "Really, don\u2019t listen to me. I\u2019m such a boring old coupled-up person\u2014I don\u2019t know anything. In my day, an app meant a bloomin\u2019 onion. Just kidding. Actually, Domino\u2019s does have that pizza-delivery-slash-dating app now, right? You swipe and then, if there\u2019s someone nearby who wants to date you, the person shows up within thirty minutes or your pizza is free.", "It almost sounds kind of fun. Like a game. If you wanted, I could swipe for you for a while, just for fun. I mean, thank God I\u2019m not on the apps, but it would be fun for, like, a day.", "Are you on that one where you put your name, age, credit-card number, whatever on your profile and it matches you with other users who have bought the same paper towels and other household goods? And then you get the paper towels, too. It\u2019s sort of a dating app meets, well, a Web site where you buy paper towels. But you save money by getting them every week. Oh, my gosh, do you belong to Costco? It\u2019s made our lives a million times easier. Sometimes I look at Seth\u2019s body in bed and I feel like it\u2019s my body and I can\u2019t tell the difference. Ha ha ha. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not single anymore! Last week, I came home and heard him crying from the driveway, so I drove around the block a few times so I could keep listening to my podcast instead of comforting him! Fun.", "But anyway.
