One observer at the time likened it to \u201ctwo bald men fighting over a comb\u201d. It grew into a two-decade-long war in which two of the world\u2019s poorest countries bled themselves to exhaustion. Waves of young men charged across the no-man\u2019s-land between their trenches, in battles reminiscent of the first world war in Europe. Perhaps 100,000 soldiers died, and half a million civilians were forced from their homes.", "Among those who fought in Badme was a young Ethiopian radio operator who briefly left his foxhole to position his antenna. When he came back to it, he found his unit had been wiped out in an artillery strike. \u201cWar is the epitome of hell,\u201d said Abiy Ahmed, the radio operator who is now Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister. \u201cI know because I was there.\u201d He ended that pointless conflict in 2018, by promising to withdraw Ethiopian troops from Badme and restoring relations with Eritrea. In 2019 Abiy won the Nobel peace prize.", "Yet now the peacemaker has turned martial. Early on November 4th, while the world\u2019s eyes were boggling at America\u2019s elections, Abiy ordered his troops into action against the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front ( TPLF ), which runs Tigray, a northern region of Ethiopia (see article). He accuses the TPLF of attacking an army base to steal weapons. \u201cThe last red line has been crossed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation.\u201d", "Abiy argues that armed action is needed to bring the TPLF to heel and to hold together Ethiopia\u2019s fractious federation of ethnically based states. Yet in resorting to tanks, rather than talks, he risks rolling Ethiopia into another pointless, hellish war. Such a war could lead to the balkanisation of Africa\u2019s second-most-populous country (with 110m people). It could also spread instability into neighbouring countries."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["abiy", "soldiers", "troops", "worlds", "war", "prime", "starting", "ethiopias", "blood", "tplf", "civil", "young", "badme", "radio", "minister", "ethiopian"], "pubDate": "2020-11-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
