Others from Facebook, Google and from Microsoft are also planning to join the protests.", "Some technology companies have tried to get out ahead of these protests by announcing their own measures to tackle climate change. The day before the strike, Jeff Bezos announced that Amazon would be entirely powered by renewable energy by 2030 and would have net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Google, meanwhile, has said it will increase its investment in renewable energy by 40 per cent. Many of these pledges however do not go as far as some of the employees have demanded. Jeff Bezos, for example, explicitly ruled out one of his employee's demands which was that Amazon should stop working with oil and gas companies.", "The problem is for many of these technology companies that they are no longer small startups which can afford to have mission statements like \"Do no evil.\" Instead they are multinational conglomerates with shareholder demands to fulfil.
