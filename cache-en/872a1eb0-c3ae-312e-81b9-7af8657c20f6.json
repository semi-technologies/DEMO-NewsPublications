Hundreds of people\u2019s lives are still on hold to prove that point", "For more than seven years, Australia\u2019s policy has been clear: if you seek asylum by boat you will never be settled here. You will be sent offshore and have your asylum claims heard there.", "Between the declaration of that policy by prime minister Kevin Rudd on 19 July 2013 and the last transfer offshore in December 2014, Australia sent 3,127 people seeking protection as refugees to Nauru and Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island.", "Analysis by Guardian Australia reveals that almost half \u2013 47% \u2013 remain in limbo. Most of those \u2013 86.7% \u2013 have been recognised as refugees.", "Those numbers represent not only a human story of struggle and endurance but a significant policy challenge for the Australian government which sent them offshore without a feasible plan to resolve their cases.", "\u201cIt shows clearly that they didn\u2019t have a plan when they went into this and certainly not a plan for what to do with the human beings who are going to be trapped up in their system,\u201d says refugee coordinator at Amnesty International Graham Thom.", "\u201cAnd ultimately that\u2019s why, seven and a half years later, we\u2019re still left with 1,500 people in a range of bizarre and cruel forms of limbo.\u201d", "Where are they now?", "Despite the government\u2019s claim that it has worked day and night to get people off Nauru and PNG, 290 people remained offshore in October 2020 \u2013 the last time for which official data was available.", "The numbers were evenly split between PNG and Nauru \u2013 145 in each.

Others have been released into the community on strict conditions.", "Although many have put down roots in their communities, the government says they can be returned to Nauru or PNG at any time. They are not allowed to apply for any visas \u2013 including temporary protection visas. Some are in community detention \u2013 a controlled release from detention which limits travel, allows no work rights and has other restrictions, but accommodation is provided.", "Increasingly this group is being pushed from community detention on to final departure bridging visas with work rights but no support. Those visas allow refugees to work but deny most of them any support if they cannot get a job. The result, community organisations say, is that many risk destitution and homelessness.", "The home affairs department says refugees and asylum seekers sent to Nauru and PNG have permanent migration options: they can resettle in the United States or another third country, settle in PNG, or voluntarily return home or to another country in which they have a right of entry.", "Thom says this is \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d.", "\u201cThey are refugees so they can\u2019t go home,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody is being sent back [offshore] whether they want to go or not.

The Abbott government struck a $55m deal with Cambodia to offer settlement to refugees sent offshore but only seven took up the offer and only one remains.", "The most significant development came in 2016, when then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a deal with the US to resettle up to 1,200 refugees.

It has led to 870 people \u2013 a bit less than a quarter of those sent offshore \u2013 being resettled. About 260 more have provisional approval to go \u2013 20 from PNG, 30 from Nauru, and 220 from Australia.", "That leaves hundreds of refugees without a clear future.", "Since 2013, New Zealand has offered to take 150 refugees from the regional processing cohort each year.
