They are decisions of the therapy doctors, with whom we are in full agreement.

However, when we removed the drain today he laughed, looked at me, grabbed my hand, and the first impression is it is favourable, but it is difficult to evaluate.", "\u201cDiego\u2019s evolution is day by day and in principle today he will be in intensive care as well. We are going to see when, in coordination with the doctors, we carry out a control tomography. That will depend on the evolution.\u201d", "Argentina\u2019s all-time leading scorer Lionel Messi used Instagram on Wednesday to wish his compatriot well.
