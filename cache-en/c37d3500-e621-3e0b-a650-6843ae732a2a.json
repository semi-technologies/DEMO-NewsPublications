The trick is to look for something else", "I\u2019ve been an optimist my whole life, with a rugged dedication that even I can see is, at times, questionable. My optimism mainly rests on a belief in the inherent goodness of people and, in many ways, I haven\u2019t been disappointed. But over the last few years I had to face the fact that most of my significant relationships have been abusive and, clearly, there\u2019s a tonne of evidence of hatred, ruthless greed and intolerance everywhere at the moment.", "These experiences have provoked something of an existential crisis in me. I still feel an optimistic outlook is, fundamentally, the only way to keep going \u2013 otherwise what\u2019s the point? How can I find a comfortable and balanced place in my mind and heart to settle?", "Eleanor says: I am like you. Or at least, I used to be. I was doggedly, irritatingly, Pollyanna-swallowed-a-bubble-of-sunshine optimistic. I ran a blog called \u201cKeep Smiling\u201d and told people to count their blessings. I thought there were always reasons to be grateful, even if there weren\u2019t always reasons to be happy. Then, like you, I discovered the ubiquity of abused power in relationships and in globally life-threatening problems and have been unable to look away since.", "'I\u2019ve tried to raise my daughter with feminist values but I\u2019m struggling with her clothes. What do I say?' | Leading questions Read more", "It\u2019s an accidental glance into the void. Because if bad things are going to keep happening, and if no one is completely trustworthy, then grief and dejection aren\u2019t only inevitable, they\u2019re rationally compelled. But having glanced into the void it\u2019s hard not to stare; we get preoccupied wondering whether things are evil all the way down.", "The problem is there probably just isn\u2019t a settled fact of the matter. There is just too much \u2013 there are too many people, too many actions, too many years in our lifespan in which to do both wretched and holy things to each other. And there\u2019s too little information about what other people are thinking and feeling, too little opportunity to see what would have happened if we\u2019d been put in bad situations, or raised with cruelty and without opportunity.", "It will drive you mad to keep looking for a settled verdict about whether things, or other people, trend towards the good. It will lock you in paranoia: but how do I know? But couldn\u2019t you be lying? Won\u2019t it just go away? We are not given very many gifts in this life. One way to destroy the ones we do get is by asking them to stand in as proof of something bigger \u2013 to ask a relationship to prove people are fundamentally good; to hope that a stranger who helps us cross the road proves that there are pure hearts out there. It sets them up so they cannot fail to disappoint us, and then the disappointment only raises our need for the next thing to prove that it will all be all right in the end.", "But we will never find satisfactory proof that it will all be alright in the end. It is impossible to insulate the optimist\u2019s beliefs from the doubt caused by hurt and inaction and tragedy and death.", "So the trick is to stop looking for proof. The thing we need to keep going isn\u2019t belief \u2013 it\u2019s hope. And hope is a choice; hope doesn\u2019t mind what has happened \u2018til now, because hope lives in the thought the next moment might be different and better.", "Hope isn\u2019t as easily deterred by evidence that goodness sometimes falters, because hope isn\u2019t about evidence. It\u2019s about possibility. Staring into the possibility of other people\u2019s badness makes us rooted to the spot, transfixed with the worst interpretations of what\u2019s going on around us. Looking back into imagination and possibility gives us something else to focus on; it tears our eyes from the void. Don\u2019t look for proof.
