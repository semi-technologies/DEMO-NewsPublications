The President, true to form, announced the departure of yet another senior official via Twitter. Pundits described Trump\u2019s timing\u2014he posted the tweet twelve minutes after the Electoral College had affirmed Joe Biden\u2019s election\u2014as that of a petty narcissist trying to regain the spotlight. Barr\u2019s motive for resigning was less clear, but, for weeks, reports had circulated that the two men were barely speaking. Barr, once the most feared, criticized, and effective member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet appeared to have finally broken with the President, and resigned.", "Last week, it emerged that Barr had known for months that investigations of Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes and financial dealings had been opened, but he adhered to a long-standing Justice Department practice and did not disclose any information that could influence the outcome of a pending election. After Biden won, Barr refused to confirm Trump\u2019s baseless claims that the contest had been stolen from him. This weekend, Trump blamed his Attorney General for his defeat. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Bill Barr reveal the truth to the public, before the Election, about Hunter Biden,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cBig disadvantage for Republicans at the polls!\u201d", "On Monday, the two men engaged in political pantomime. In the tweet announcing Barr\u2019s departure, Trump said that they had just had a \u201cvery nice meeting\u201d and said Barr had done \u201can outstanding job.\u201d Barr released an effusive resignation letter that hailed Trump\u2019s \u201cunprecedented achievements\u201d despite \u201ca partisan onslaught\u201d that \u201cfew could have weathered\u201d and \u201cin which no tactic, no matter how abusive and deceitful, was out of bounds.\u201d A senior law-enforcement official, who asked not to be named, described the exchange to me as scripted: \u201cI think that this was a negotiated departure. The President was clearly frustrated. The A.G. was clearly frustrated.\u201d", "Former Justice Departments officials and legal experts were unequivocal in their assessment of Barr\u2019s legacy. They credited him for breaking with Trump in the prelude to and aftermath of the election. But they predicted that he would go down in history as one of the country\u2019s most destructive Attorneys General. \u201cThe few times Barr put the nation ahead of the President will not atone for the many times he chose the opposite. He leaves a wounded department,\u201d Stephen Gillers, an expert in legal ethics at New York University School of Law, told me. \u201cHis tenure as Attorney General will be akin to the plague years at the Justice Department,\u201d David Laufman, a former Justice Department official, said. \u201cI think his tenure has been an indefensible and disgraceful betrayal of long-established norms,\u201d Donald Ayer, a former Deputy Attorney General, noted. (The senior law-enforcement official was more magnanimous, calling Barr\u2019s legacy a \u201cmixed bag.\u201d) A spokesperson for Barr did not respond to a request for comment.", "What made Barr unusual were the disparate qualities he exhibited as Attorney General. He was aggressive, competent, and astute; even critics admitted that at times his legal machinations were \u201cdevilishly clever.\u201d He was also not simply a Trump acolyte. For decades, Barr has had a consistent legal philosophy: he adamantly opposes the Supreme Court activism of the nineteen-sixties and seventies that legalized abortion, curtailed the powers of the President, and, he has contended, reduced the freedoms enjoyed by religiously observant Americans. He was a committed Reagan-era conservative, fervently advocating a law-and-order approach to criminal justice, including strong public support for the police, the use of overwhelming force to restore order, and the employment of the death penalty. What emerged unexpectedly in the Trump era was his willingness to act in a nakedly partisan manner in order to politically aid the President he served, a pattern reminiscent of John Mitchell, Richard Nixon\u2019s Attorney General.", "The result was a dizzying array of actions in the twenty-two months that Barr has spent in the office. He distorted the findings of the Mueller report, reduced the penalties faced by Trump loyalists whom Mueller prosecuted, expanded the Administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, attempted to restrict access to abortion, aided attempts to win public funding for religious schools, executed more federal prisoners than any of his modern predecessors, criticized judges who ruled against Trump, defied congressional oversight, said that organized religion was under \u201cassault\u201d from the liberal \u00e9lite, vastly exaggerated the role of Antifa protesters in last summer\u2019s marches for racial justice, reportedly ordered the police operation that enabled Trump\u2019s Bible photo-op in Lafayette Square, called pandemic stay-at-home orders the \u201cgreatest intrusion on civil liberties\u201d since slavery, said a Trump re\u00eblection loss would plunge the country \u201cirrevocably\u201d down a \u201csocialist path,\u201d and warned that mail-in ballots would \u201copen the floodgates\u201d to fraud.", "Ayer, the former Deputy Attorney General, said that Barr undermined decades of Justice Department practice aimed at giving Americans confidence that the law applies equally to all citizens. \u201cThroughout much of 2020, there was the Attorney General, using the department\u2019s resources and his own bully pulpit to echo and reinforce the President\u2019s campaign narrative,\u201d Ayer said. \u201cHe did so many things this year that an Attorney General should never do.\u201d", "The senior law-enforcement official countered that Barr is sincere in his belief that a strong Presidency is necessary in order to insure effective government, and that judges often curtail a President\u2019s ability to implement policy. In speeches, he has said that congressional oversight and the appointment of special counsels have become so politicized that the party in opposition uses them to lay relentless political siege to the Administration in power. The official told me that Barr really thinks that the F.B.I.\u2019s 2016 investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia should never have been conducted. This last point is, in part, a reflection of Barr\u2019s belief that F.B.I. directors, who officially report to the Attorney General, have become too independent. \u201cHe truly believes that some of the things the F.B.I. did was wrong,\u201d the official said, referring to the Trump-Russia investigation. \u201cI think he wanted to rein in the F.B.I. more.\u201d", "The problem with Barr\u2019s views of the Trump-Russia investigation is that they fly in the face of fact. They are, in short, Trumpian. The exhaustive investigations by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee found that Russia did intervene to aid Trump in the 2016 campaign, and that Trump campaign officials had met with a Russian intelligence officer or with individuals with ties to the Russian government. A review by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general found that the F.B.I. investigation was legally justified, given the actions of Trump\u2019s associates. Yet Barr, in a move that pleased the President, launched a criminal investigation of F.B.I. officials who opened the Trump-Russia probe. In October, he made John Durham, the federal prosecutor conducting that investigation, a special counsel, which will prevent Biden\u2019s Attorney General from significantly limiting his work.", "Attention now turns to Barr\u2019s successor, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will serve in the post during the final four weeks of Trump\u2019s Presidency. Trump will likely pressure him to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hunter Biden, to keep alive his dark claims of election theft, Biden-family graft, and vast corruption on the part of the liberal \u00e9lite. Rosen\u2019s record does not inspire confidence in his ability to resist Trump. A staunch conservative who has never worked as a prosecutor, Rosen played a leading role in the Justice Department effort to block the publication of the former national-security adviser John Bolton\u2019s unflattering memoir of his time in a dysfunctional Trump White House.", "Barr deserves credit for refusing to go along with Trump\u2019s post-election de-facto coup attempt. But he also exacerbated the explosion of \u201calternative facts\u201d in the Trump era. At a time when division and confusion regarding basic facts were already rampant among Americans, Barr used his position as a fact-finder to increase discord, not ease it. He decried the special-counsel probe and other investigations of Trump as politically motivated inquisitions. Whatever his intentions, his legacy will be that he then unleashed those same demons. Barr has extended the cycle of politically motivated investigations that increasingly plague American politics."], "authors": ["David Rohde", "David Rohd"], "keywords": ["general", "legacy", "trump", "trumps", "president", "investigation", "remains", "barr", "barrs", "william", "official", "justice", "going", "attorney", "trumpian"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
