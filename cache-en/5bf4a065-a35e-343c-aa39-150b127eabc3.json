That design caused me a grand mal seizure, which inspired me to write a small guide about how epileptics and neurologically sensitive players could navigate around that and still enjoy Night City. Since then, I've spoken with CDPR in conjunction with the Epilepsy of Foundation about how a small change can make a huge difference. With the new Cyberpunk 2077 update, that change is reflected inside of the new patch notes.", "The epilepsy fix:", "The patch notes address quite a few issues, including quest bugs, but here is the part that tackles the braindance sequence specifically:", "\"Modified the flashing effect on braindances to reduce the risk of inducing epileptic symptoms.
