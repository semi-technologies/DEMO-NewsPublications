He has long denied any wrongdoing and tried to depict his departure as natural. \u201cI always said a prime minister should not serve for more than two legislatures,\u201d he said in a televised address.

Mr Fenech pleaded not guilty. According to Caruana Galizia\u2019s son, Paul, before her death his mother was investigating links between Mr Fenech, a gas deal with Azerbaijan and two senior figures in Mr Muscat\u2019s government: his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and the former energy minister, Konrad Mizzi.

Both deny any wrongdoing.", "Mr Muscat delayed his departure. He said his party would start choosing a new leader on January 12th. He would step down as prime minister \u201cin the days after\u201d.

Three men charged with her murder are yet to be tried. Last month a fourth man offered information on the killing in return for immunity from prosecution. He testified in court on December 4th that he had paid the alleged killers on behalf of Mr Fenech, who was the sole organiser of the murder. But he added that, after the men were arrested, he was asked by a member of the prime minister\u2019s entourage to tell them they would get bail and \u20ac1m ($1.1m) each.
