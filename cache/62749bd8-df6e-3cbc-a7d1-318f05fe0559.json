Last week, the electric carmaker rolled out a couple of very fun new updates, like \u201ccaraoke,\u201d a sharper Automatic Lane Change feature, and in-car app upgrades. But nothing seemed to catch the attention of Tesla lovers\u2014and haters\u2014more than \u201cSmart Summon,\u201d a feature that allows drivers to beckon their empty cars to them through empty parking lots. But of course, the feature is in beta, and it\u2019s not yet perfect. Does it have normal, no-big-deal bugs, or is it a safety disaster? Well, like most things Tesla, that depends on where you\u2019re sitting. The federal auto safety regulator says it\u2019s aware of Smart Summon and still \u201cgathering information\u201d about the feature. For now, as with all things driving-related: Pay attention out there, people!", "Also this week: A \u201cflying car\u201d gets quieter, a brand new airline won\u2019t squish your legs (because you can\u2019t actually fly inside its \u201cplanes\u201d), and we explore why Rio\u2019s much-anticipated transit system is struggling.
