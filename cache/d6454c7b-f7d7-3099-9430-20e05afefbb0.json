An extra-long M14 bus drove through\u2014honkety honk honk!\u2014and was whooped at. A tech worker named Anton Saleh, in an upside-down Lakers face mask, said, \u201cI feel like I could cry. It\u2019s a real sense of relief.\u201d He pounded his heart. A woman near him, Daniella Deutsch, agreed. \u201cI just feel hope for the first time in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a lot of people have been waiting for this for four years. And now we can actually move forward.\u201d She wore a sweatshirt that read \u201cIt\u2019s Okay Not to Be Okay.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a preschool teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been going in every day. My kiddos know more about democracy and this election than a lot of adults in this country do.\u201d", "Children raise a Biden-Harris banner.", "Under the all-seeing eye of a painted mural at the Horus Caf\u00e9, the horn-blaring was near constant, and a spontaneous group performance of \u201cNa Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\u201d had begun. \u201cThis is wild,\u201d a young Broadway-theatre staffer said, smiling at the scene. When I asked if she\u2019d done any political volunteering, she said, \u201cI\u2019m actually a professional psychic. There\u2019s a lot of witches around the area, and people would come into my store all the time, like, \u2018What do I do to help?\u2019 So I gave them binding spells against Trump.\u201d Nearby, Julian Ribeiro, a skater and retail worker in flowered pants, a butterfly-print baseball cap, and a tattered Bauhaus T-shirt\u2014\u201cMost of these shirts are my mom\u2019s\u201d\u2014had come from Brooklyn to experience the \u201crevelry\u201d in the East Village. \u201cI watched a whole table at brunch in Williamsburg get up with full mimosas and go down the street like a parade,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody was playing \u2018Party in the U.S.A.,\u2019 by Miley Cyrus.\u201d What did he hope to see in the coming year? He\u2019d like to get out of a mask, he said. Otherwise, \u201cI\u2019m hoping for unbounded sweetness.\u201d", "Somebody started chanting, \u201cBiden! Biden! Biden!\u201d Eli Scheinholtz, a local who works in public relations, said, of the coming Biden era, \u201cPolitically, I hope they pass another stimulus package.\u201d Beyond that, \u201cI hope to see my grandma again. She lives in Pittsburgh\u2014she\u2019s one of the Pittsburgh mail-in ballots. She did everything right.\u201d Another city bus drove by, merrily honking. \u201cI saw a garbage truck doing it earlier,\u201d Scheinholtz said. \u201cThere was no way they were picking up anything. Just circling and honking, having the time of their life.\u201d Across the street, two masked bike-delivery guys edged through the crowd and gently bumped into each other; they looked at each other, smiled, and carried on. I talked to Jordan Lapid, who wore a flag bandanna mask and a giant flag cape. \u201cI keep a flag with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it represents everybody, not just half the country. The people have spoken.\u201d Lapid lives nearby and works as a registered nurse. \u201cI\u2019ve been helping out with COVID,\u201d in hospitals in New York and California, he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. The optimism got sucked out of me. But I\u2019m glad people came together and faced the facts and did what had to be done.\u201d"], "authors": ["Sarah Larson", "Sarah Larso", "David Remnic", "Susan B.
