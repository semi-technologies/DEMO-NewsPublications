The company delivered just 239 commercial aircraft in the first half of the year, down 37% from the same period in 2018. And it had no new orders whatsoever in the second quarter for its 737 MAX aircraft, from which it makes around a third of its revenues and profits.", "The news is hardly surprising, given that the 737 MAX was grounded in March by safety regulators around the world after two crashes in just five months killed 346 people. This has hit Boeing in the pocket, as it only gets paid for planes when they are delivered, and airlines are refusing to take any MAX jets until they are allowed to fly again.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Furthermore, carriers are losing confidence that the aircraft\u2019s problems will actually be fixed at any point soon. In May Boeing revealed a fix for the software issues that contributed to those accidents, but more issues are emerging. A new problem with the plane\u2019s microprocessors emerged in late June, which will take months to fix. And on July 5th European aviation regulators revealed another new software fault. The Federal Aviation Administration, America\u2019s safety regulator, does not want to unground the MAX until other countries\u2019 regulators do so. As a result carriers are already cancelling more flights this autumn.", "The rumour among airline executives is that the MAX may not get airborne again this year. And their patience with Boeing is starting to run out. On July 8th flyadeal, a low-cost airline from Saudi Arabia, became the first airline to cancel an order for 737 MAXs\u2014it had requested 30\u2014in favour of Airbus\u2019s competing A320neo.
