The West\u2019s disputes with China mean that trillion-dollar supply chains are up for grabs. India has the abundant land mass needed for manufacturing, the long coastlines needed for shipping, the millions of under-employed young people needed for labour and a vast pool of software engineers, all of which should make it a worthy alternative to the vexing communist state to its north, or at the very least a complement.", "But even before the spread of covid-19 crushed India\u2019s economy, conditions were deteriorating as companies found its virtues more evident in theory than reality. GDP growth has been declining since 2016, and investment since 2018. Annual vehicle sales reported in March 2020 (ie, almost entirely pre-lockdown) were lower than they had been a year earlier. As the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research firm, put it, industrial production went \u201cfrom down to downer\u201d.", "Inevitably, there will be a rebound. Economists have begun suggesting the possibility of a slight contraction in GDP during the first half of 2021, tempered by a sharp increase in the latter half of the year, assuming a catch-up for lost sales. Privately, many speculate about a multi-year decline.", "Years of bad financial management mean the government\u2019s accounts were stretched pre-covid, but disguised by fanciful expectations for tax receipts and windfalls from the divestment of government-controlled entities. Even previously plausible expectations are unfeasible now. Tax collections have tanked; nothing has been divested. Deficits, already huge, will swell even without further demands, which could arise from large-scale vaccinations and recapitalisation of the banking system.", "The repeated delay of a necessary clean-up of government-controlled banks meant the financial system entered the crisis in bad shape. Things have got worse as emergency rules have allowed companies to defer repayments and banks to pretend they were being made whole. At the same time, inflation, fed in part by the cash-starved government\u2019s levies on petrol, has been rising, adding to borrowing costs. The challenge for 2021 will be to manage a national bail-out with money that (unlike richer countries) India cannot print cheaply.", "Mr Modi has been on a global tour to attract needed foreign investment. The reaction has been public enthusiasm but private reluctance. There have been exceptions. Some overseas funds have taken minority stakes in banks and existing assets with strong franchises, such as Delhi\u2019s airport. Money has been flooding into Reliance Industries, India\u2019s biggest company, and (in far smaller amounts) into Adani Group, another conglomerate. Each has the great talent of being able to navigate the country\u2019s mercurial regulators and courts. The billions of dollars poured into these investments by Facebook, Google, and a host of private-equity giants, sovereign-wealth funds and multinational companies were hailed by the local press as expressions of confidence in India Inc. But they may be just the opposite. After years of trying to make it on their own, with decidedly mixed results, many foreign firms have concluded that the only way to get ahead in India is to team up with a well-connected local conglomerate.", "For India to rebound, broad investment must recover and for that, foreign businesses must be persuaded that the deck is not stacked against them. There will be some exceptions: Apple, for example, is scaling up smartphone production in India, both to diversify away from China and to avoid import tariffs that push up its prices. Much of the investment Mr Modi is hoping for, however, will head to Bangladesh, Vietnam and other developing countries with more tolerable business environments.", "Given these difficulties, a genuine economic crisis in India would hardly be a surprise. Credit-rating agencies debated downgrading India\u2019s sovereign debt to junk in 2020, but decided to wait and see if its prior high rates of growth will return. Though a downgrade would not mean much in itself\u2014India has little foreign debt\u2014it would shake already fragile confidence. Multiple financial institutions have failed over the past two years.", "All is not lost. In August a returnee to the largely closed building in Mumbai that houses The Economist\u2019s local office was delighted to be greeted outside by the familiar bookseller, phone repairman and chaiwallah (tea-seller), who were eager to resume business, plague and monsoon notwithstanding. They are part of a vast informal economy\u2014responsible for perhaps 80% of India\u2019s employment and half its GDP\u2014in which resilient entrepreneurism thrives, beyond the government\u2019s asphyxiating grip. It will keep India going in 2021.", "Tom Easton: South Asia business and finance editor, The Economist \u25a0", "This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline \u201cPre-existing condition\u201d"], "authors": ["Tom Easton", "South Asia Business", "Finance Editor", "The Economist"], "keywords": ["crisis", "foreign", "world", "india", "local", "coronavirus", "investment", "economy", "governments", "needed", "modi", "mean", "indias", "half", "sick", "2021"], "pubDate": "2020-11-17T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
