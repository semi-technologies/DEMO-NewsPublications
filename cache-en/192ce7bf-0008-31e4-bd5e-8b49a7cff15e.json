really cool in a way", "because the fans are able to connect with them", "in a little bit more of an intimate setting", "rather than on the stage.", "Sure.", "So K-pop idols use a multitude of tools

that as a role model", "for the rest of the industry.", "Hopefully, that'll trickle down throughout the industry,", "and more stars can take a total break", "and step away from that need to constantly
