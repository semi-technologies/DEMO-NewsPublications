He is the tall, slim man with a mop of dark hair, a jutting chin, and handsome face that looks like it may have taken a few punches. He might be holding an umbrella over the mayor\u2019s gray curls, or a thick clutch of briefing papers. Segarra\u2019s formal title was Special Assistant to the Mayor. These days, he would likely be referred to as a body man, the guy who makes sure his boss has what he needs, and who clears a path to make sure that there are no surprises.", "Dinkins and Segarra first met in 1967, when Segarra was working in City Hall as a community liaison for Mayor John Lindsay. A colleague suggested that he should get to know Dinkins, a Howard and Brooklyn Law School graduate who was serving in the New York State Assembly. Segarra, who is Puerto Rican and who started out as a community activist in East Harlem, said that he recognized a kindred spirit in Dinkins. \u201cHe understood this city. He told me he wanted to work for the city as a whole, to be a voice for the unheard, the hidden figures,\u201d Segarra, who is seventy-eight, recalled last week from his apartment in the West Village, where he is riding out the pandemic. That was the start of fifty-three years of friendship, which ended last month when Dinkins, who served a single term as New York City\u2019s mayor, from 1990 to 1993, died at age ninety-three.", "New York\u2019s first Black mayor was few people\u2019s notion of a militant. He was dapper and soft-spoken, courteous to a fault, a man whose mornings began with a round of tennis and whose evenings often included a black-tie event. A former marine, he had a habit of greeting almost every man he encountered as \u201cbuddy.\u201d The reforms that Dinkins put in place\u2014housing for the homeless, longer hours for libraries, schools, health clinics, and recreation centers\u2014enhanced the quality of life for all New Yorkers. But hostility from those who resented the presence of a Black man in the city\u2019s top office remained an occupational hazard. \u201cThe hate messages would pour into City Hall,\u201d Segarra said. \u201cHe was always under that pressure, but he dealt with it with civility and compassion.\u201d", "Dinkins served for almost a decade as city clerk, a largely ceremonial post but one that still provided opportunities to improve the circumstances of those denied equality. In the early nineteen-eighties, Segarra said that he was visiting his friend at his office, in the Municipal Building, when Dinkins took a call. \u201cHe gets off the phone and says, \u2018Come on, we\u2019re going up to Mount Sinai hospital.\u2019 \u201d At the hospital, Dinkins led Segarra down a corridor to a room where nurses were huddled outside. Segarra recalled, \u201cThey start telling Dave, \u2018Don\u2019t go in there, this patient has AIDS. You could get sick\u2014you could die.\u2019 \u201d Dinkins was undeterred. The patient and his male partner, Segarra recalled, had summoned Dinkins to marry them. This was one of Dinkins\u2019s chief powers as city clerk, and a ritual that he relished. He proceeded to perform the ceremony at the patient\u2019s bedside. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t legal then, of course,\u201d Segarra said. \u201cBut he wanted to do it for them.\u201d", "Arnie Segarra said, of his former boss, \u201cHe understood this city.\u201d Dinkins died, in November, at age ninety-three. Photograph by Steve Mack / Alamy", "Dinkins\u2019s road to City Hall began with his election, in 1985, as Borough President of Manhattan. Segarra was one of his first hires. Another key aide was a veteran labor organizer named Bill Lynch, who helped nudge the cautious Dinkins to consider a run for City Hall. Jesse Jackson\u2019s strong local showing in the 1988 Democratic Presidential primary helped him decide to take the plunge.", "Dinkins was in the midst of his mayoral primary campaign when the city was stunned by a murder. On August 23rd, 1989, a crowd of bat-wielding whites beat and shot to death a sixteen-year-old Black boy named Yusuf Hawkins, in the largely white neighborhood of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. In the wake of the killing, Dinkins went to the neighborhood to meet with civic leaders. Segarra recalled, \u201cWe are walking down the street and these folks are following us and shouting, \u201cGo back to Africa.\u2019 \u201d Segarra grew nervous. \u201cDave said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I got this.\u2019 \u201d When they arrived at the spot where Dinkins was to speak, he turned to address his pursuers. \u201cThe first words out of his mouth are, \u2018I am going to be your mayor, too.\u2019 There was just this silence then.\u201d", "Dinkins\u2019s pledge to salve the city\u2019s racial wounds helped him triumph in the primary over the three-term incumbent, Ed Koch, who had stumbled badly in responding to the city\u2019s racial strife and whose third term was plagued by a major municipal-corruption scandal. In the general election, Dinkins narrowly defeated the Republican, Rudy Giuliani, who had risen to fame as the hard-charging federal prosecutor who convicted top figures in the scandal.", "But, even as mayor, Dinkins was often met with racial animosity in the city\u2019s white neighborhoods. He had served for slightly more than a year in City Hall when, in March, 1991, he went to Staten Island, a largely white borough that had voted overwhelmingly for Giuliani, to march in the local St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade. A few parade-watchers greeted him warmly and offered embraces. But Segarra recalled that there were also jeers and racial taunts. \u201cThere is this guy standing there holding a baby and he is yelling \u2018Nigger, go home,\u2019 \u201d Segarra said. \u201cDave walks over to the man. \u2018Say it to my face,\u2019 he told him. The guy just stood there. And Dave says, \u2018How can you say that while holding your child?\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cWhen he wanted to be, he was one tough Marine,\u201d Segarra said. \u201cWhen he had a certain look on his face, you just stopped.\u201d", "The public rarely glimpsed that side of Dinkins during his years in City Hall. He was better known for his stoic reserve and a reluctance to raise his voice. In a city that celebrated Koch-style brazenness, his tolerance was often interpreted as timidity or weakness. That was especially true in the wake of the Crown Heights riots of 1991, which occurred after a car in the motorcade of the Lubavitcher rebbe, the leader of the neighborhood\u2019s large Orthodox Jewish population, struck two Black children and killed one of them. As Dinkins later acknowledged, police were too slow to respond; a rabbinical student was stabbed to death during the riots, an incident that would come to define his mayoralty.", "The closest the mayor came to a public display of outrage was in September, 1992, when thousands of mostly white city police officers held a raucous and beer-fuelled rally at City Hall, to protest Dinkins\u2019s efforts to allow civilians to review complaints of police misconduct. Off-duty cops stopped traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge, rushed past barricades to seize the steps of City Hall, tossed racial slurs at a Black councilwoman, and held signs condemning the mayor. \u201cDinkins, we know your true color\u2014yellowbellied,\u201d one read. \u201cDump the Washroom attendant,\u201d read another. Giuliani spoke from a platform with police-union leaders and cheered on the crowd. Dinkins\u2019s police-reform efforts, he shouted, were \u201cbullshit.\u201d", "Dinkins was away from City Hall during the mini-riot, but, upon his return, he was livid. \u201cHe was shaken. His reaction was that it was just racist,\u201d Segarra recalled. Still, Dinkins reached for terms that tempered his feelings. The police protest, he told the press, was \u201cbordering on hooliganism.\u201d Giuliani, he said, was \u201cseizing upon a fragile circumstance in our city for his own political gain.\u201d", "The following year, when Giuliani made his second run for City Hall, crime was his main theme. Race, however, often seemed to be his subtext. \u201cNo one group can have all their agenda,\u201d he said repeatedly on the campaign stump, an unsubtle suggestion that Dinkins favored Black New Yorkers. Giuliani claimed that the mayor had tilted against the police, and had failed to punish criminals. In fact, crime had started to fall for the first time in years in the city, thanks to Dinkins\u2019s efforts to put five thousand more police on the streets and his hiring of a capable new police commissioner named Ray Kelly.", "The results were again close, but this time Giuliani was ahead by fifty-three thousand votes. When the election was called, Segarra was with Dinkins in a crowded room at the Sheraton New York Hotel, on Seventh Avenue. Reports had come in during the day that off-duty police officers had been present at some polls, warning voters that they risked deportation for voting illegally. Some of those in the room urged Dinkins to demand a recount. Segarra recalled that Dinkins shook his head and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want a divided city.\u201d The defeated mayor then went downstairs and urged his supporters to help Giuliani to be \u201cas good a mayor as he can be.\u201d It was time to move forward, he told them. \u201cWe have made history,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing can ever take that away from us.\u201d", "After his years in City Hall, Dinkins settled quietly into the role of a civic statesman. He taught at Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs, which later added a chair in his name. He also hosted a talk show, \u201cDialogue with Dinkins,\u201d on the Black-oriented station WLIB, and wrote a memoir of his career. He kept up his tennis game as well, switching to doubles, which a friend said was easier at his age, and lent his name to numerous causes that sought his endorsement. In 2015, the Municipal Building where he had worked as clerk and borough president was renamed in his honor. Dinkins told the small audience at the ceremony that he had tried to stand for \u201cgovernment that lifts us all up and does not beat any of us down, that inspires rather than discourages.\u201d", "Segarra remained close with his former boss, speaking at least once a week, and celebrating Christmas together. In October, he called to console Dinkins after the death of his wife, Joyce, at age eighty-nine. The couple had been married for sixty-seven years. \u201cHis voice was breaking a bit, but he was holding up,\u201d Segarra said. A few days before Dinkins died, on November 23rd, the two old friends planned a socially distant visit for the following Saturday. Segarra told me, \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll see you then, buddy.\u2019 \u201d"], "authors": ["Tom Robbins", "Tom Robbin"], "keywords": ["city", "mayor", "remembers", "segarra", "recalled", "david", "friend", "told", "man", "black", "hall", "dinkins", "old", "giuliani"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
