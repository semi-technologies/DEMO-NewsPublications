Several new carriers have decided to take to the skies in what must be one of the most uncertain periods the aviation industry has ever experienced.", "Earlier this month, South African start-up LIFT Airline completed its maiden flight, signaling the start of regular domestic services just in time for the country's summer season.", "Meanwhile, Pacifika Air hopes to launch in June 2021 with direct services between the cities of Wellington and Christchurch in New Zealand to the Cook Islands, following the announcement of a travel bubble between the destinations.", "And over in Norway, even as the previous decade's low-cost success story Norwegian Air is facing serious financial troubles, a new airline, built from scratch, is about to take off.", "Norwegian aviation veteran Erik G. Braathen unveiled Flyr in October 2020, a carrier created to serve the popular domestic market in Norway, alongside select other destinations in Europe.", "The airline has yet to complete any flights -- Braathen is busy debating which planes to lease in time for launch in spring/summer 2021 -- but there are already 30 employees on the books.", "And while the short-term outlook for airlines might currently be bleak, Flyr's team believe they'll be poised to capitalize on a gap in the market as the roll out of vaccines begins to reopen the world.", "\"What if we start an airline based on a 2020 vintage, that is a low-cost operation based out of Norway, that is the right size for what we see the market is going to be forward?\" says Braathen.", "New vision", "New CEO Tonje Wikstr\u00f8m Frislid, pictured here, is heading up the venture on the ground. Courtesy Hans Fredrik Asbj\u00f8rnsen", "Braathen is no stranger to managing airlines.

Running an airline, with the priorities of safety and punctuality and robustness, is quite complex,\" Wikstr\u00f8m Frislid tells CNN Travel.", "Braathen adds that his vision is to create an airline founded on \"very sophisticated and integrated digital systems.\"", "Flyr wants to make it easy to book a ticket, easy to amend the ticket, and easy to track your flight and all associated details.", "Creating \"modern systems\" is key, says Wikstr\u00f8m Frislid, arguing that the ability to start from scratch was an advantage over legacy carriers. \"That's a huge investment for an old airline.

But he says actually offering competitively low prices can be tough, and the low-cost European market is already quite saturated.", "Mayer is also skeptical about how far a digital-first approach can take an airline, while acknowledging it's a good basis for a business and customer experience:", "\"At the end of the day, you need to have a physical product as well, that's the aircraft transporting a passenger from A to B,\" he says. \"You can't build a brand or a product purely by saying we're doing things digital completely, because that's not really possible.\"", "Related content The spoof airline that could actually predict the future of travel", "Flyr hopes to launch in Norway in the first half of 2021.
