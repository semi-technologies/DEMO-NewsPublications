He is \u201csuffering from pains in his joints, particularly his knees, making it difficult for him to walk comfortably without assistance, and there is evidence of damage to his feet, adding to the pain in walking\u201d, the panel found.", "The panel also claims evidence submitted to it shows \u201che has not been able to contest his detention before an independent and impartial judge, has no access to a lawyer to discuss his situation and his case has not been reviewed to determine whether it is appropriate to continue his detention\u201d. He has not been allowed to see either his family or his doctor.", "The MPs said Bin Nayef had recently been released from solitary detention after nine months, but added he had been warned he would be sent back to solitary confinement unless he agreed to release funds to the kingdom, an alleged threat described as coercion by the panel.", "They claim it is in the interests of the international community and Saudi Arabia itself that it urgently addresses its human rights record so it \u201ccan defend and explain its actions in a way that will not leave it wholly pilloried in the wider court of global public opinion\u201d.", "They also say the Saudi failure to live up to international human rights standards weakens the kingdom and the security of the west.", "Saudi Arabia refused to cooperate with the work of the panel, although the Saudi ambassador to the UK did hold an informal off the record meeting with the panel chairman about the panel\u2019s purpose.
