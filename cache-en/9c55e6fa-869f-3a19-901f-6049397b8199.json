The EU is ready to go the extra mile to agree on a fair, sustainable and balanced deal for citizens in the EU and UK. It is for the UK to choose between such a positive outcome or a no-deal outcome.\u201d", "The focus of the negotiation remains on maintaining fair competition over time, EU access to British fishing waters, and a system of dispute resolution if the terms of the treaty are breached.", "EU leaders will meet on Thursday where they could sign off on an agreement or trigger their preparations for a no-deal outcome, including temporary legislation to keep planes in the air.", "Senior diplomats in Brussels were predicting a difficult phone call between Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Monday evening, the second such call in a matter of days.", "Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said: \u201cHaving heard from Michel Barnier this morning, really the news is very downbeat. I would say he is very gloomy, and obviously very cautious about the ability to make progress today.\u201d", "Progress on the issues of EU fleets access to British fishing waters, as reported by the Guardian, was upended late on Sunday night when David Frost, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator, tabled new demands about the ownership of boats.", "Under the proposals, any vessels majority-owned or staffed by EU nationals would not be allowed to sail under the UK flag, sources in Brussels said.", "Vessels currently need only an \u201ceconomic link\u201d to the UK, such as landing more than half their catch at British ports or having majority British crews. Companies based in Iceland, Spain and the Netherlands fished 55% of the UK\u2019s fishing quota in 2019, according to research published this year.", "EU sources had said the two sides were close to a deal earlier in the day, but Barnier quelled any optimism, telling ambassadors on Monday morning that the negotiation was \u201cdifficult\u201d as he explained the new British demand.", "One senior EU diplomat said: \u201cThis has really caused a lot of problems. A paper was handed over late on Sunday night. This is serious.\u201d", "Confidence had been raised by Britain\u2019s apparent acceptance that quotas should not be negotiated annually. But the government has rejected the bloc\u2019s proposal that this be done every decade.", "Barnier said there also remained differences over quota numbers and the UK\u2019s intention to block access to the six- to 12-mile zone, seas in which French and Belgian fleets in particular have fished for centuries. \u201cThat is worrying at this stage in the negotiation,\u201d he said.", "Barnier said the issue of \u201cnon-regression\u201d from current standards had progressed well but common ground had still not been found on the EU\u2019s demand for a mechanism to ensure a baseline of minimum environmental, social and labour standards raises on both sides over time. The issue was fast becoming the biggest obstacle to a deal, EU diplomats said.", "Barnier told ambassadors that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that an agreement would fall into place on dispute resolution. Downing Street was yet to agree to provisions that would allow for one side to suspend parts of the deal, known as a \u201ccross suspension clause\u201d, Barnier said. He added that he believed there was a way forward."], "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "keywords": ["barnier", "brexit", "uk", "negotiation", "eu", "sides", "michel", "deal", "british", "brussels", "talks", "uks", "agreement"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
