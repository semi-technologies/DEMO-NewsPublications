A few months ago, however, the rakish Rocky Horror Show creator, Crystal Maze presenter and transgender parent-of-three received a stark reminder of his advancing years.", "He was pottering around at home in New Zealand when he suddenly found himself lying on the floor. \u201cI didn\u2019t register that something was desperately wrong,\u201d he says, speaking from the house he shares with his third wife, Sabrina, 10 miles outside of Katikati. \u201cI just thought: \u2018I wonder why I can\u2019t get up.\u2019\u201d Struggling to his feet, he attempted to make a drink, only to discover he couldn\u2019t put the top back on the milk. \u201cI was in a dream-like state. Finally, I gave up with the milk, went to go back to the bedroom, slid down the wall and started speaking in tongues. That\u2019s when Sabrina called the ambulance.\u201d", "It was a stroke. \u201cJust a little one,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cI bounced back.\u201d But he has had to make a few unwelcome adjustments to his lifestyle. \u201cI used to love sitting on the back porch all day with a bottle of very full-bodied red at my elbow and a couple of jazz cigarettes. I couldn\u2019t think of anything nicer, quite frankly.\u201d Those days are over. \u201cIt cheeses me off. What can you have as a substitute?\u201d A mirthless chuckle. \u201cYou can\u2019t drink tea all day.\u201d", "\u2018Pretending you\u2019re someone else is rather wonderful\u2019 \u2026O\u2019Brien\u2019s brigadier character in The Barren Author.", "Still, he is keeping busy. The reason for our conversation today is the six-part Baron Munchausen-esque audio comedy The Barren Author, in which he plays the Brigadier, a spinner of deliriously tall tales. Surreal flights of fantasy \u2014 in the second episode, a highly trained squad of Elton John lookalikes defend the genuine article from the Stasi \u2014 are lent an extra comic gleam by O\u2019Brien\u2019s plummy, unfazed delivery.", "He claims not to see many similarities between himself and the Brigadier. \u201cThough I do have fantasy figures who I introduce into my daily pursuits. I\u2019ll ask a question, flip it up into the air and find a character who\u2019ll answer it for me. I suppose it is a kind of insanity but it doesn\u2019t harm anyone. Pretending you\u2019re someone else is rather wonderful. It\u2019s a very childish pursuit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d", "Do I shave my body hair? Ooh, we\u2019re getting a bit personal, aren\u2019t we? As it happens, yes. All shaving is feminising", "Elements of the character chime so closely with O\u2019Brien that I assumed he had added them to the script himself. Take the Brigadier\u2019s recollection that \u201chair was unwilling to make itself at home on my adolescent body\u201d and his memory of schoolfriends who \u201cdidn\u2019t know whether to invite me to the rugby or buy me flowers\u201d. Doesn\u2019t that sound like O\u2019Brien, who at six years old horrified his older brother by expressing a desire to become a fairy princess? \u201cNothing to do with me!\u201d he protests. \u201cI was as surprised as you were when that came up. In fact, Sabrina raised her eyebrows: \u2018I say!\u2019\u201d", "He started shaving his scalp in the mid-1970s in response to the wear-and-tear from a series of dye jobs. Does he shave his body hair, too? \u201cOoh, we\u2019re getting a bit personal here, aren\u2019t we? As it happens, yes. It feminises the body. All shaving is feminising. I wonder when men first started shaving their faces. That must have been an interesting point in time.\u201d", "O\u2019Brien has spent his life pinballing back and forth between Britain and New Zealand. Born in Cheltenham, he moved to Tuaranga with his parents as a child. They wanted to see \u201cwhether life could be better somewhere other than monochromatic postwar Britain\u201d. What he admired about the new country was its lack of a class system. \u201cNo one was allowed to be your social superior. When I got back to Britain, that was a hugely wonderful card to be holding. Lords and ladies? Fuck that. New Zealand gave me that gift.\u201d", "After growing restless in his early 20s, he decamped, as it were, to London. \u201cI was in Mick Jagger\u2019s front room in 1965. I was friends with his then-girlfriend, [the model] Chrissie Shrimpton, and she introduced me to the rockocracy. England was swinging like a pendulum. There was nowhere better to be on the planet and I went for it. I should be dead, you know. I\u2019ve led a very excessive lifestyle.\u201d", "\u2018It was only meant to run for three weeks\u2019 \u2026 Tim Curry as Dr Frank-N-Furter with O\u2019Brien, right, in 1975\u2019s Rocky Horror Picture Show. Photograph: 20th Century-Fox/Everett/Rex", "He got paid to ride horses in movies (his debut was in Carry On Cowboy) then drifted into theatre, where he took any job going. Even sweeping up after a performance made him happy \u2014 at least he was on the stage. When he was asked to perform at an EMI party, he wrote a song specially for the occasion: Science Fiction/Double Feature, an homage to trashy B-movies. From that evolved in 1973 the most deranged and distinctive stage musical of its age.", "The Rocky Horror Show follows two wholesome American sweethearts, Brad and Janet, who stumble upon a spooky tumbledown mansion where they are relieved of their inhibitions by Frank-N-Furter, the sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania. Booked into the cramped 63-seat Theatre Upstairs at the Royal Court, the show sold out, transferred multiple times, ran for seven consecutive years and has been playing somewhere in the world ever since. A 1975 screen version became the ultimate cult movie, dominating the late-night circuit and inspiring devotees to pitch up weekend after weekend in wigs, corsets, fishnets and slap.", "\u2018I know that I\u2019m loved\u2019 \u2026 O\u2019Brien and wife Sabrina. Photograph: Ian West/PA", "O\u2019Brien, who played the hunchbacked, Time Warp-dancing butler Riff-Raff, remembers the view from the stage on opening night. \u201cThere was a big electrical storm and Vincent Price was sitting in the audience under the skylight. The lightning flashed and lit him up. I thought: \u2018Fuck me, that\u2019s a good omen!\u2019\u201d The theatre was packed and sweaty. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a spare inch. We had one microphone hanging down from the ceiling, and it would swing past the audience\u2019s heads.\u201d", "During the show\u2019s first transfer, \u201cthe penny dropped that there was a life to this piece that we hadn\u2019t anticipated. I was dispassionate about it. I was one of those people who held off getting too excited about things in case they got taken away.\u201d That said, he will admit to some astonishment at its longevity. \u201cIt\u2019ll be 50 years old in three years\u2019 time. It was only meant to run three weeks!\u201d", "Does he think Rocky Horror contributed to the discussion of gender and sexuality? \u201cMost definitely so. That wasn\u2019t intended but I\u2019m grateful it\u2019s helped other people feel less isolated or lonely.\u201d It helped him, too. \u201cBeing transgender is a nightmare for many people. I\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019m in showbiz where I can be this eccentric person and therefore it\u2019s allowed. If I were a primary school teacher maybe that wouldn\u2019t be the case.\u201d", "His openness and inclusivity made it surprising when he remarked in 2016 that a trans woman \u201ccan\u2019t be a woman. You can be an idea of a woman.\u201d It felt like an inflexible statement from the man who in Rocky Horror preached the ultimate message of empowerment and self-actualisation: \u201cDon\u2019t dream it. Be it.\u201d", "Does he still hold that view on trans identity? \u201cYou and I have to be very careful here,\u201d he says, sounding wary for the first time. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what\u2019s been happening with JK Rowling. I think anybody who decides to take the huge step with a sex change deserves encouragement and a thumbs-up. As long as they\u2019re happy and fulfilled, I applaud them to my very last day. But you can\u2019t ever become a natural woman. I think that\u2019s probably where Rowling is coming from. That\u2019s as far as I\u2019m going to go because people get upset if I have an opinion that doesn\u2019t line up with theirs. They think I\u2019m being mean-spirited and I don\u2019t want that at all.\u201d He came out as transgender comparatively recently, saying at the time \u201cI believe myself probably to be about 70% male, 30% female \u2026 I think of myself as a third sex and it makes things easier.\u201d", "There have been grim times in his life, including a period that he has described cryptically as \u201cthe abyss.\u201d What was the nature of that? \u201cI went mad,\u201d he says gravely. \u201cI stepped off the edge. I took this drug \u2014 I think it was probably a pipe of crack. It was a night from hell and it sent me loopy. It took me a long while to get over that. I could only see madness, people killing each other. I was trying to be sane but I couldn\u2019t find sanity in the world.\u201d It was 18 months before he felt he had fully recovered with the help of friends and family, including his grandchildren \u2014 five of them, with another on the way. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that gets me through the day,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that I\u2019m loved.\u201d"], "authors": ["Ryan Gilbey"], "keywords": ["dead", "think", "body", "sabrina", "horror", "shaving", "thats", "richard", "obrien", "ive", "excessive", "woman", "rocky", "horrors", "im", "lifestyle"], "pubDate": "2020-11-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
