IAC, under Chairman Barry Diller, is pushing back, saying such a move would devastate a key part of its business.", "The Alphabet Inc. unit so far hasn\u2019t acted on the internal recommendation of its Chrome trust and safety team regarding IAC in part because the two are rivals in some categories and because the search giant\u2019s executives, including Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker, are concerned that penalties could be viewed as anticompetitive, according to people familiar with the matter.", "Google was sued in October by federal prosecutors for allegedly operating an antitrust monopoly in search. State officials are wrapping up their own investigations, which may result in additional charges. Google has said it would contest any allegations in court.", "The search company\u2019s concern with IAC centers on browser extensions, which are external applications that run inside Google\u2019s Chrome browser. IAC-made browser extensions promise users quick access to content such as daily Bible quotations, power-tool manuals and government forms.", "Google\u2019s investigators found that IAC\u2019s browser extensions often promise functions they don\u2019t deliver and steer users toward extra ads, according to documents reviewed by the Journal. The Google report said the behavior was egregious and recommended \u201cimmediate removal and deactivation\u201d of IAC\u2019s browser extensions from the search company\u2019s web store, the documents show.", "The concern is a big one for IAC and Google, which collect hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue through deals with each other, the people familiar with the matter said. Google earlier this year took down five IAC browser extensions, the documents show, but many more remain operational.", "A Google spokesman, Scott Westover, said in a statement that the two companies remain in discussions. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing the remaining extensions and our enforcement options, and have not made a decision regarding IAC\u2019s status on the store,\u201d he said.", "An IAC spokeswoman, Valerie Combs, disputed that the extensions violate Google policies. \u201cGoogle has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from us to advertise and distribute these products in the Chrome Store,\u201d said Ms. Combs. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new here\u2014Google has used their position to reduce our browser business to the last small corner of the internet, which they\u2019re now seeking to quash.\u201d", "Publicly traded IAC owns Angie\u2019s List, Investopedia and more than 100 other online products. The company offers a search engine called MyWay that maintains a tiny fraction of the search business, using results and ads provided by Google.", "Google is by far the world\u2019s largest online advertising brokerage. Researchers estimate about one of every three dollars in online ads are sold through the company.", "Mr. Diller\u2019s company was once Google\u2019s biggest advertiser, according to Kantar Media, and current and former Google employees said IAC remains one of Google\u2019s larger advertising clients.", "IAC spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on Google ads, according to people familiar with the matter, and its financial statements show Mr. Diller\u2019s company received 27% of its total revenue last year from Google.", "IAC\u2019s dozens of browser extensions, which Google documents show have been installed by Chrome users more than 150 million times, accounted for $291 million in IAC revenue last year. The extensions change users\u2019 Chrome home pages to versions of MyWay, the IAC-owned search engine.", "IAC earns money from the Google-furnished ads served in MyWay\u2019s search results. Google both takes a share of that revenue and earns money on the ads that IAC buys on Google platforms to promote its browser extensions. IAC\u2019s profit from the browser-extension business has fallen 87% over the past three years, according to the company, and in the most recent quarter accounted for only 5% of overall revenue.", "The concerns raised by Google\u2019s enforcement staff center on whether IAC\u2019s browser extensions and their marketing are misleading Chrome users.", "The search giant this year performed a broad audit of IAC\u2019s business practices on Google platforms.", "Many users of IAC extensions expressed agitation, the audit found. \u201cTricked into installing it and can\u2019t delete it,\u201d said one user in a review on the Google Chrome store, which the audit called representative. \u201cDO NOT INSTALL\u201d warned another.", "\u201cIAC\u2019s business model appears to rely almost exclusively on unintentional installs,\u201d members of the Chrome safety team wrote in the audit.", "Of special concern in the audit were ads that IAC ran against search terms such as \u201chow to vote,\u201d \u201cvote by mail\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d Users who clicked on the ads didn\u2019t get voting-related information, the audit found. Instead, their browser home pages were reset to MyWay, and the separate, IAC-owned Ask.com toolbar was installed on those users\u2019 browsers, the audit found. The audit found that IAC continued to run such ads even after Google told the company to stop.", "The practice of changing a user\u2019s browser settings without his or her full understanding and consent is known as \u201cbrowser hijacking\u201d and has been deemed unethical by antivirus companies.", "Ms. Combs, IAC\u2019s spokeswoman, acknowledged that some of the ads cited by Google\u2019s investigators were inappropriate and misleading. She blamed affiliate marketers that the company said it has since fired.", "But IAC bristled at the finding that its browser extensions were generally unwanted and duplicitous, adding that Google approved those extensions in its Chrome store for years as part of the companies\u2019 partnership agreement. Emails reviewed by the Journal reflect Google\u2019s involvement, with Google staff discussing the extensions\u2019 marketing, down to the wording of disclosures and the sizing of fonts.", "\u201cGoogle exercises significant control over what we do with these products,\u201d Ms. Combs said."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["practices", "search", "chrome", "dillers", "browser", "spars", "marketing", "iac", "barry", "extensions", "audit", "iacs", "google", "users", "ads"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
