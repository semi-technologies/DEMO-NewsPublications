(They did also announce the best bars globally. But thanks to the raging coronavirus pandemic in this country, we can\u2019t cross international borders, so that\u2019s irrelevant!) So as Friday night nears, here\u2019s a handy guide for where to order a state-of-the-art cocktail while anxiously awaiting the state of the union.", "Dante (New York)", "The official best bar in America? That would be Dante, the 104-year-old institution that recently opened a second outpost in the West Village. Under the leadership of Linden Pride and Nathalie Hudson, they\u2019ve become a critical darling\u2014in 2019, they took the official crown as The Best Bar in World. This year they claimed second place, making them the top spot in North America.", "With an outdoor dining setup that echoes the bistros and caf\u00e9s of Europe, it\u2019s the perfect place to have an aperitif al fresco this fall. Especially with their new warm drinks menu, which includes a hot buttered rum with raspberries or hot smoked toddy with marmalade.", "Attaboy (New York and Nashville)", "There is no menu at Attaboy, a custom craft cocktail bar in New York and Nashville that\u2019s been a staple on the World\u2019s Best Bar ranking for the past several years. (Currently, they\u2019re ranked as number 12 in the world, and second in America.) Instead, you just tell the bartender what you\u2019re feeling. Which, let\u2019s be real\u2014is probably a lot.", "NoMad Bar (New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas)", "The NoMad Bar, which is ranked as the third best bar in America, is closed at each of its respective hotel hotspots in New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas. But when they do reopen, you should go there. Especially those in Clark County\u2014who, thanks to John King\u2019s magic map, I now care about deeply.", "Katana Kitten (New York)", "This Japanese cocktail bar, ranked as 16th best bar in the world and fourth in America, is the epitome of cool: there are vintage posters from Tokyo, a retro playlist, and decor inspired by Japan\u2019s Taiso period\u2014known as the country\u2019s jazz age. Order a Toki highball and stay awhile.", "Employee\u2019s Only (New York and Los Angeles)", "There have been 12 years, and 12 editions, of the World\u2019s Best Bar Awards. Employee\u2019s Only has been listed on every single one. This year, they rank 38th in the world and fifth in America. Credited with bringing the mixologist movement to New York City, it\u2019s got a prohibition-style vibe that makes it perennially popular with Gotham\u2019s denizens. In 2018, they opened a second watering hole in West Hollywood.", "Caf\u00e9 La Trova (Miami, Florida)", "A haunt in the heart of Little Havana, Caf\u00e9 La Trova crafts creative cocktails Cubanos: think mojitos, frozen banana daiquiris, and a Hotel Nacional (pineapple rum, apricot liqueur, pineapple juice, lime juice).
