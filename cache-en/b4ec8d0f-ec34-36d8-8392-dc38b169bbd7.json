The government had offered no data to back up the notion that eating outside increases the spread of COVID-19, and Rodriguez, a Democrat and the first woman to represent L.A.\u2019s seventh district (deep valley, taquerias and take-out joints), noted that seven hundred thousand jobs were at stake. She called on the county to reconsider, and to \u201creserve the tightest restrictions for activities that data prove are the leading causes of outbreaks.\u201d", "\u201cLike, everybody that went out to celebrate the Dodger game,\u201d she said the next day, on a video call, or \u201cchurches still holding gatherings without proper protective gear.\u201d She had a salt-and-pepper bob and wore large tortoiseshell glasses. She called the application and enforcement of the county\u2019s COVID restrictions \u201cinconsistent,\u201d and added, \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating as all hell.\u201d She cited New York City, where her husband was born, as a model for how restaurants should function. \u201cI saw some of the tents on Instagram,\u201d she said, referring to the sidewalk bubbles in which New York restaurants are serving meals. \u201cI thought, Oh, my God, look at what they\u2019re doing, and how quickly they\u2019re doing it. It was phenomenal.\u201d", "Rodriguez\u2019s resolution passed eleven to three in the L.A. City Council and (as of last Friday) is awaiting a response from the mayor. But the outdoor-dining ban will be in place for a minimum of three weeks (indoor dining has been banned since July), and any loosening of restrictions will have to be approved by the county. Rodriguez has asked the county to provide data to support the ban. Restaurants, she said, \u201cwere operating all summer, and we didn\u2019t have a problem. So I want to understand: how do we all of a sudden have a problem now?\u201d Last week, a judge ordered county health officials to provide scientific evidence justifying the ban. (At least one county supervisor who supported the ban seems conflicted: hours after Sheila Kuehl called outdoor dining \u201ca most dangerous situation,\u201d she dined on the patio of a Santa Monica Italian restaurant.)", "Rodriguez, who is forty-six, grew up in the San Fernando Valley and started working for the city at twenty, interning at city hall. Prior to being elected to the city council, in 2017, she was the vice-president of L.A.\u2019s board of public works. In that role she worked with restaurateurs, helping the owners of Jon & Vinny\u2019s navigate sidewalk dining, and expediting the opening of Petit Trois, a Hollywood bistro helmed by the French chef Ludo Lefebvre. (\u201cHe was, like, \u2018Zee city permeets ees terrible,\u2019 \u201dshe recalled.) In 2014, Rodriguez and her husband met Doug Rankin, Lefebvre\u2019s director of culinary operations. \u201cShe\u2019s the only person I know that\u2019s in the conversation,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cI can reach out and be, like, \u2018Hey, what the fuck\u2019s going on?\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cI think we can do without that, Eddie.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Mort Gerberg", "Last fall, the restaurateur Jeff Ellermeyer asked Rankin to be the executive chef of a French bistro in Silver Lake. (It\u2019s called Bar Restaurant, to the chagrin of the uninitiated who Google it.) On the final night of outdoor dining before the ban took effect, Rankin wistfully surveyed the more than two dozen patrons lingering at tables set out in the parking lot of Bar Restaurant. He wore a navy-blue apron and a face mask, which he lowered, intermittently, to sip from a tumbler of extra-dirty Martini. In July, Ellermeyer had spent ten thousand dollars on heat lamps, potted olive trees, and outdoor speakers. \u201cPlus all the gear\u2014fucking thermometers and shit,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re asked to do everything, and you comply, and then complying is still not enough.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIf they told me, \u2018Shut down for three weeks, we\u2019re gonna give you P.P.P. again, and make sure your people are paid\u2019\u2014cool.\u201d He added, \u201cBy the way, show me the data that says we should shut down, first of all.\u201d", "Behind him, an engine revved, and he turned around to address the driver, who was one of his sous-chefs. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Rankin asked. \u201cAll right, buddy, I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d He turned back and explained, \u201cThat\u2019s one of my right-hand guys. What we realized, after doing the math, is that we can only keep three of the four of us in the kitchen, even at a reduced rate. We had to have the conversation about who was in the best position in their life to be furloughed.\u201d The sous-chef\u2019s girlfriend works from home. The rest, including Rankin, are breadwinners. \u201cHe made the decision to furlough himself,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cYou know how hard it is to have a conversation like that with people? Like, \u2018Hey, who\u2019s losing their job?\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cFor me, what\u2019s weird about the whole thing is that it\u2019s kind of skewed my political views a little bit,\u201d he went on. \u201cLike, am I a Democrat? Because if this is what that is, I\u2019m not into it.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Sheila Marikar", "Sheila Marika"], "keywords": ["restaurants", "rankin", "rodriguez", "city", "data", "councilwomans", "quest", "dining", "county", "outdoor", "called", "asked", "open", "ban", "california"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
