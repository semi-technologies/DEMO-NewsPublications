One moment too sweet, the next too creamy, and sometimes that crucially crisp biscuit base goes soggy: it is hard to get them right. I often find they are over-filled, leaving me slumped in my seat. But this one is different: a cheesecake tart with a shallower filling than normal. There\u2019s enough sugar to sweeten, but not so much as to spoil the flavour of the cream cheese.
