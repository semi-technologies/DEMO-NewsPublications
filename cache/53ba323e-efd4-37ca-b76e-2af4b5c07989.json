She was planning a huge relaunch with three new sets: Witch Cottage, Magick Avenue, and Olde Salem Village. Each set was hand built and later hand painted by Hitchcock herself. \u201cPeople walk in and say that their jaws just dropped,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are very much theatrical sets.\u201d Hitchcock also noted that pre-pandemic she had invested in expanding her women\u2019s costumes as well. \u201cThis year, we have 30 new women\u2019s costumes,\u201d she says. \u201cI know 30 is not a huge number, but it is in my operation.\u201d", "Owner Hope Hitchcock and photographer Billie Desmond wearing custom Witch Pix masks Photo: Courtesy of Witch Pix", "Hitchcock notes that crowds of people are still coming into Salem to celebrate Halloween, but that has brought in another issue: The City of Salem has instituted sets of COVID-19 rules and regulations regarding crowd control, sealing off parking lots and enforcing geo-fencing so people can\u2019t buy tickets to events unless they are already inside the city. (Local train service has been skipping the Salem stop.)", "\u201cIt\u2019s very mixed emotions and different sides of the rationale,\u201d says Hitchcock. Despite the obvious constraints on her busiest month of the year, she is staying positive. \u201cI\u2019m hanging on until the next season, which is spring. I think I am going to be okay by the skin of my chinny chin chin. I will do what I can because I know in my heart that what I had planned on, what we built this year, it\u2019s in place now, it\u2019s successful, and it\u2019s going to be successful next year. I have to keep reminding myself because there is truly an emotional seesaw.\u201d \\", "@halloweenhappy in a custom Witch Pix mask", "Customers sanitizing their hands before they take photographs Photo: Courtesy of Witch Pix"], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["witch", "costumes", "set", "pix", "citys", "favorite", "weirdest", "womens", "hitchcock", "successful", "sets", "halloween", "surviving", "salem", "courtesy"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
