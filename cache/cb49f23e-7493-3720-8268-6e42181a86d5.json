My main thing when you play someone who is real, you kind of want their blessing because you have a responsibility.", "\u201cSo I asked her: \u2018Are you OK with me playing you?\u2019 and she said: \u2018You\u2019re better than the other actress\u2019 \u2026 that they were thinking of. They will not admit who it was. It was me and somebody else.", "\u201cThat made me think maybe she is here, because that is a classic Margaret thing to say. She was really good at complimenting you and putting you down at the same time.", "\u201cThen she said: \u2018But you\u2019re going to have to brush up and be more groomed and neater.\u2019 Then she said: \u2018Get the smoking right. I smoked in a very particular way. Remember that \u2013 this is a big note \u2013 the cigarette holder was as much a weapon for expression as it was for smoking.\u2019\u201d", "Bonham Carter is taking over the role in seasons three and four of The Crown from the Bafta-winning Vanessa Kirby.

They loved the woman and were very happy to talk about her because they miss her.\u201d", "Bonham Carter said Margaret was a misunderstood and misinterpreted royal. People thought her \u201cangry, rude and tough\u201d but \u201cshe wasn\u2019t tough at all, she was highly vulnerable and often attack is the best form of defence\u201d.", "She said Margaret was very much her father\u2019s daughter, with his stammer and anxiety. \u201cShe smoked throughout her life and she drank. It was like she didn\u2019t have the extra layer of skin.\u201d", "The actor\u2019s interviewer, Emma Freud, told a story of meeting the princess at a drinks party shortly after having her first child and asking whether she wanted to see a photograph. Margaret said no.", "Bonham Carter said she had learned that Margaret had an inability to dissemble. \u201cShe just couldn\u2019t feign, which is an appalling lack when you are famous and you have to meet all these people. Whatever was in her head popped out of her mouth. She was like a time bomb.\u201d", "The Crown is drama, not documentary, and the royal household has gone out of its way to stress it does not give it a seal of approval.

I have photos of them together and they look really dashing as a couple \u2026 It was definitely pre-Townsend. They remained forever friends.\u201d", "The connection meant they met on the odd occasion. At one reception Margaret said: \u201cOh Helena \u2026 You are getting better at acting, aren\u2019t you?\u201d", "Bonham Carter has starred in around 90 films over three decades but will in some eyes always be just one character: Bellatrix Lestrange.", "Harry Potter fans had screamed in her face, she said. \u201cWhat did they scream?\u201d asked Freud. \u201cNo, just screamed \u2026 aaaagh, terror.
