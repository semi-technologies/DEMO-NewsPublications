When the duo were looking to evolve the colorful and classic styles from European conservas for a modern brand that would appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds, they tapped LA-based graphic designer Danbo, the creator behind their illustrated logo. But while seeking to evoke the simple rituals and old world charm of European conservas with their offerings, Fishwife is also intended to help Americans expand their appetite and palate for tinned fish. \"The kinds of tinned fish that people are familiar with are largely limited to tuna, maybe salmon,\" explains Millstein. \"Somewhere along the line, it seems that Americans had decided that tinned fish was not a desirable culinary choice. We want to kick open the door to the glory that is forking lemony sardines over a buttered baguette, plucking juicy mussels in olive oil straight out of the can.\"", "For their array of mouth-watering offerings, Fishwife is sourcing both internationally and domestically. Their sardines and mussels are from the coast of Galicia, a region with one of the richest conservas traditions. \"The oceanography is such that the cold waters of the Atlantic mix with pure river water from the mountains, creating a perfect environment for harvesting fantastic fish and seafood,\" explains Goldfarb. For species that they can readily source from the Northern Pacific, like salmon and tuna, they're working with independent domestic fisherwomen and men. \"In speaking with fishermen up and down the west coast, we learned that many had lost revenue due to a drop in their restaurant sales during COVID-19, and were looking for other routes to market,\" says Millstein. \"Tinned products, which are shelf-stable, can provide an alternate revenue stream.\" While tried-and-true favorites such as the sardines in olive oil with natural lemon and herby garlicky mussels will be available year-round, the pair says Fishwife will be \"keeping it spicy\" with small runs of seasonal, domestic tinned fish releases as well. Fishwife is releasing their first limited drop in partnership with fisherwoman Kat Murphy, who runs her own salmon fishing business, Katfish Salmon Co. in Southeast Alaska.", "Photo: Natalie Berger", "Amid the global pandemic, with travel largely on hold, Fishwife not only offers the flavors of faraway seas, but helps foster a deeper appreciation for how the ocean nourishes and inspires. Since its soft launch, Fishwife has been collaborating with female-identifying writers, including poet Natasha Rao, choreographer and doula Ogemdi Ude, and critic and reporter Sophie Haigney, to compose snippets of fish, boat-side, and sea-related writing to roll out on their Instagram.", "\"Sly wink of a fish, brackish then brined, thin gills brimming with light,\" writes Rao in her Ode to the Sardine. \"O slip of glitter, I want to scoop you into my pelican mouth, my snark snout, I want to chase you with a sip of wine for a taste of frenzy, of freedom, you who have flickered through the coursing waters of time, dined with emperors, brought sauces to life. You prove nothing is too small to be mighty, O shimmering symbol of spirit and sea!\" While helping to stock pandemic-time pantries, Fishwife is revitalizing centuries-old tradition and offering a new kind of tinned fish experience."], "authors": ["Lauren Valenti", "Lauren Valent"], "keywords": ["tuna", "small", "waters", "mussels", "tinned", "fishwife", "fish", "conservas", "stylish", "sardines", "sustainablysourced", "meet", "salmon", "kitchen"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
