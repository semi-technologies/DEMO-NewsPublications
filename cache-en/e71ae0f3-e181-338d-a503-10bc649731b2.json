(Born in Maputo, Mozambique, Namoda spent time in a handful of countries across Africa, while Denizeri lived between Istanbul and London.) Since then, their relationship has evolved even further. Last week, Namoda and Denizeri, who launched her eponymous swimwear label in the spring of 2019, revealed their year-in-the-making collection of spirited, playful maillots.", "\u201cI feel like you really took a leap [with your line] and were like, \u2018I\u2019m making a bright orange bathing suit!\u2019 So when you approached me about doing a collaboration, it seemed like a unique opportunity,\u201d explains Namoda, who set to work on a series of watercolors that could be transformed into patterns while in residency at Pocoapoco in Oaxaca last fall. \u201cI was thinking about my childhood chasing crabs on the beach, as well as Melisa\u2019s summers spent in the south [of Turkey],\u201d she continues. The result is a trio of nostalgic motifs\u2014evil eyes, simple shells, and the colorful cubes of the traditional Turkish dessert lokum\u2014married with a dreamy palette of lilac, cherry red, and dusty chocolate. The last of which, Namoda notes, is a universally flattering shade: \u201cI 100% believe that everyone across the board\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter what skin tone [you have]\u2014looks good in brown.\u201d", "Photo: Brad Ogbonna Photo: Brad Ogbonna", "Fans of Denizeri\u2019s clean lines might be surprised to discover that this collaboration plays with some embellishments. \u201cI wanted to introduce more feminine silhouettes,\u201d Denizeri says of her new ruffle trim, which was inspired by children\u2019s swimwear and appears on both a bikini set and a strapless one-piece. Yet her loyalists can rest assured that though the shapes may be frillier, they\u2019re still functional\u2014a must for both Denizeri and Namoda. \u201cWith so much swimwear today, you need an ultra bikini wax,\u201d Namoda says with a laugh, before adding, \u201cI can wear these surfing. I can wear them doing yoga. I can feel free in my feminine body in them.\u201d For proof, look to the collection\u2019s look book, photographed by Brad Ogbonna, in which a Denizeri-clad Namoda sits atop a moped and lounges around her studio with her chocolate Lab, Montana, by her side.", "Such images are a testament to the wearability of Denizeri\u2019s designs\u2014not to mention emblematic of how Namoda styles them in real life. \u201cThe swimsuits I have of yours are covered in paint!\u201d Namoda tells Denizeri. \u201cI wore them all summer because they were just so comfortable and utilitarian.\u201d When it gets warm again, Namoda is looking forward to slipping into the new, bolder suits, such as a \u201970s-esque purple-and-black one-piece, which she\u2019ll pair with an oversized scrunchie, or the candy-color bandeau bikini. \u201cIt feels really sexy,\u201d muses Namoda. As for Denizeri? \u201cThe seashell print just makes me so happy,\u201d she says, smiling.
