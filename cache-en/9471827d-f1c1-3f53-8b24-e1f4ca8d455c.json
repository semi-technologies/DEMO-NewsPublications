Photograph by Chris McAndrew / Camera Press / Re\u200bdux", "Atul Gawande is outlandishly accomplished. The son of Indian immigrants, he grew up in Athens, Ohio, and was educated at Athens High School, Stanford, Oxford, and Harvard, where he studied issues of public health. Before working as a surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, in Boston, he advised such politicians as Jim Cooper and Bill Clinton. He teaches at Harvard and is the chairman of Ariadne Labs, which works on innovation in health-care delivery and solutions, and he recently spent two years as the C.E.O. of a health-care venture called Haven, which is co-owned by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway.", "Gawande is also a writer, and he has been publishing in The New Yorker for more than two decades. In 2009, heading into the debate over the Affordable Care Act, President Obama told colleagues that he had been deeply affected by Gawande\u2019s article in the magazine called \u201cThe Cost Conundrum,\u201d a study conducted in McAllen, Texas. Obama made the piece required reading for his staff. Gawande\u2019s most recent book, a Times No. 1 best-seller, is \u201cBeing Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End.\u201d", "Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Gawande has been sharp in his criticism of the Trump Administration and, like Anthony Fauci and other prominent figures in public health, insistent on clear, basic measures to reduce levels of disease. After the election in November, President-elect Biden formed a COVID-19 advisory board and included Gawande among its members. Earlier this week, I spoke with Gawande for The New Yorker Radio Hour. In the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Gawande says that President Trump\u2019s relative silence on the issue after the election might be a blessing (considering the alternative). He suggests that the development of vaccines promises great things down the line, a return to relative normalcy some months from now. But, before that happens, he says, we may not only see terrible rates of illness and death\u2014we will also experience an almost inevitably contentious rollout of the vaccine. Questions of who gets the vaccine and when will test a deeply divided society. As Gawande put it, \u201cThe bus drivers never came before the bankers before.\u201d", "We currently have one of the highest death and transmission rates of COVID-19 in the world. What went wrong?", "There\u2019s so many things that went wrong, but you can boil it down to the difficulty of pulling together. One of the most critical things you have in the toolbox in public health is communications. It\u2019s your ability to have clear priorities and communication about those priorities to your own public and to all of the players who get stuff done. We didn\u2019t get testing started early. We weren\u2019t calling the laboratories together to get testing built and created right from the get-go. And then fast-forward to where we are today. We still are in a world where we have not had clear communications from the top of the government around whether we should be wearing masks and having an actual national strategy to fight the virus. I would boil down what went wrong to not committing to communicating clearly and with one voice about the seriousness of what we\u2019re up against and what the measures are to solve it.", "When this began, I read \u201cThe Great Influenza,\u201d John M. Barry\u2019s book about 1918 and the horrendous flu that killed millions worldwide, and many hundreds of thousands in the United States. I thought to myself, Well, it\u2019s not possible that we would repeat these mistakes, because, after all, we learn from history, even if the President of the United States does not. How is it possible that we made these same mistakes on such a mass scale? Do you lay it all at the feet of the President?", "There\u2019s a big part of this that I lay at the feet of the President. Imagine Pearl Harbor happened, and then we spent seven or eight months deciding whether or not we were going to fight back. And then, seven or eight months into it, a new President is going to come in who says, O.K., we are going to fight now. But you now have substantial parts of the country already arrayed against the idea that fighting it is worthwhile. In the meantime, some states have fought the attack and other states have not, and they\u2019ve had to compete with each other for supplies. That\u2019s the mess we have.", "In May, I got to write about this in The New Yorker: the hospitals learned how to bring people to work and have them succeed. It was a formula that included masks, included some basic hygiene, some basic distancing, and testing. That\u2019s been the formula, and is the formula still, for making it possible for people to resume a normal life. But we did not have a commitment from the very top to make this happen on a national basis. And we are continuing to litigate that issue to this very day.", "You are now on President-elect Biden\u2019s advisory board on COVID-19, and I wonder what kind of co\u00f6peration you\u2019re getting from the Trump Administration\u2019s own advisory board.", "Well, remember: up until just a few days ago, there was no contact allowed at all between any Administration officials and the Biden-Harris transition team. So only in the last few days have there started to be the contacts that would allow for basic information to be passed. I think it\u2019s too early to say how well those channels of communication are turning out.", "I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, Atul, but, just to be clear here: we\u2019re in a public-health emergency. Are you saying that the President\u2019s theories, ill-founded and fantastical theories about the election, held up any communication whatsoever between President Trump\u2019s advisory board and President-elect Biden\u2019s board?", "Absolutely. And I want to put a pin in what that means, in concrete fact. Here, we had a vaccine trial that came out three weeks ago showing a successful, effective vaccine, followed, just a few days later, by another vaccine trial. We did not have access to the information they were getting about the status of those trials. We did not have access to information about supplies. So, at the beginning of the year, with Operation Warp Speed, the target was three hundred million vaccines produced by the end of the year. Instead, what we\u2019re seeing is reportedly thirty million or so by the end of [December]. We\u2019re seeing in the press some backtracking from that as well. What were the bottlenecks that meant that this couldn\u2019t be done? Is it a shortage of raw ingredients? Are they having stockpile problems? Is it a problem with the actual production processes?", "Here\u2019s another one when I\u2019m talking to colleagues around the country who are going to be involved in distributing the vaccine: We hear about everything from shortages of gloves, uncertainty about supplies of needles and syringes for three hundred and thirty million people to get two rounds of doses. There\u2019s no information yet on how many vaccines will be allocated to a given state or a given big pharmacy company like CVS or Walgreens\u2014places that are an important part of the distribution chain. So there\u2019s a lot of basic information that hasn\u2019t been known. That discovery process is just starting.", "The Biden Administration-to-be\u2019s COVID-19 task force has got a seven-point plan to stop the pandemic. What are the crucial elements of that plan?", "It\u2019s the same story that we\u2019ve known since April: It\u2019s mandating masks\u2014that\u2019s one of the most important tools we have for driving transmission down. It\u2019s testing and being able to make sure that there\u2019s widespread availability of testing. It\u2019s supplies for the places that are going to need proper gloves, masks, et cetera. It\u2019s continuing, based on the level of spread in a given community, to tune how much capacity restriction you have on indoor environments, whether it\u2019s bars and restaurants or weddings or other gatherings that are seen to be currently driving transmission. Those are all critical elements. I\u2019m firmly in agreement with where the President-elect is going on heeding the advice from public-health people that schools can be opened. But, in order for kids to be back in schools, especially elementary and middle schools, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to insure they have the supplies that they need to maintain distancing, to have the right ventilation."], "authors": ["David Remnick", "David Remnic", "Atul Gawand"], "keywords": ["theres", "vaccines", "supplies", "coronavirus", "president", "information", "gawande", "ending", "basic", "vaccine", "going", "testing", "pandemic", "prospects", "states", "atul"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
