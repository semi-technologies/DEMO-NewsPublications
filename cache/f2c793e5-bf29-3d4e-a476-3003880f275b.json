You defeat enemies by commanding swarms of the titular creatures who pummel giant bugs and other pests with their tiny fists until the foes are vanquished. You face multiple (and often competing) tasks, which must be prioritized and managed as the daylight relentlessly fades. Pikmin 3 added another juggling element when it first released on Wii U in 2013, giving players alternating control of three different diminutive astronauts. Leave one idle, and you\u2019re wasting precious time and resources. Moving between all of these things competing for your attention can make you feel like every plate is just a few spins away from crashing to the floor \u2013 but it\u2019s a good kind of overwhelming, to be clear. Pikmin 3 Deluxe doesn\u2019t overhaul objectives or streamline tasks, but it gives you the opportunity to add a co-pilot along for the campaign, which lets you focus more on coordination and less on fussy micromanagement.", "If you didn\u2019t play the original version, Pikmin 3 Deluxe is largely the same game when you tackle it solo. As a member of an alien crew, you\u2019re responsible for saving your home planet by scouring the Earth-like planet PNF-404 for fruit and other edibles. Thanks to their diminutive size, an orange provides a bounty of juice that can sustain the trio for days. They\u2019re so small, however, that moving that kind of prize back to their ship would be an impossible task, even if all three of them pitched in. That\u2019s where the Pikmin come in. These friendly critters are happy to carry objects around, uncover shortcuts across the levels, and fight comparatively gargantuan beasts on your behalf.", "Pikmin are split across a variety of colors, with each type providing special abilities. Pink ones can fly across streams and ponds, while blue ones can dive right in. Try that with one of the other varieties, such as the shockproof yellow ones, and you end up with a team of drowning victims. Fortunately, their numbers can be replaced by converting the corpses of defeated foes into new Pikmin seeds. It\u2019s pretty grim stuff if you take the time to consider what\u2019s happening, so the less you think about it all the better. You\u2019re introduced to new types as you progress through the campaign, and you\u2019re incentivized to revisit the handful of maps with Pikmin who can get you through previously impassible barriers.", "The campaign was a lot of fun in its original form, thanks in no small measure to its frantic nature. Once you reunite your crew, successfully maneuvering through the day requires a fair measure of planning. Some areas can only be reached by tossing a crewmate across a gap or otherwise splitting up. The dedicated map (which was on the Wii U touchscreen) is gone from the deluxe edition, but the addition of co-op throughout the campaign is a worthy exchange. It breathes new life into the game, making some of the most strenuous challenges much more manageable.", "Another player can jump in at any time via split-screen co-op. Each player has free rein (or whistle) to enlist Pikmin and explore the map for fruit and other elements. That cooperative framework was already in place originally, but through A.I. companions or multiplayer side missions. In Deluxe, it\u2019s easier than ever to coordinate goals for an in-game day and find efficient ways to accomplish them. A bridge needs to be constructed? I can focus on that element with my little group as my teammate aims their attention on scouring the area for hidden fruit. Functionally, it is the same process before, but being able to simply talk to another person and come up with plans together or react on the fly is more engaging than I would have guessed.", "In addition to the campaign, you can spend some time with a variety of different side missions. Most of those are from the original release or its DLC, but there\u2019s also a new string of missions that show what a pair of other explorers, Olimar and Louie, got up to after the events of the story. It\u2019s a pretty slight addition, but I enjoyed mastering each set of challenges (with a helper) to unlock platinum medals in each one. I also liked seeing a few twists on the mission types and even a small tweak or two to familiar maps. Seeing a stream I\u2019ve crossed dozens of times drained wasn\u2019t mind-blowing by any stretch, but it was a nice change of pace.", "Pikmin 3 was one of my favorite Wii U games, which isn\u2019t meant to be faint praise it sounds like. Thanks to Pikmin 3 Deluxe, players who didn\u2019t get around to checking it out in its original form have a chance to do so on the Switch. And better yet, they\u2019re getting a version that lives up to its potential as a game to bring people together \u2013 even if it\u2019s just to move tangerines and grapes around."], "authors": ["Senior Editor", "Jeff Has Spent Countless Hours Using His Thumbs To Maneuver Images On Television Screens."], "keywords": ["review", "campaign", "thanks", "small", "missions", "original", "ones", "youre", "sharing", "pikmin", "deluxe", "load", "wii"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
