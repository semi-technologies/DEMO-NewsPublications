I have spent a lot of time with them over the past eight months to better understand their struggles. For a lot of these children, their parents will have worked their entire lives and this is the first time they will have lent on the government for help.", "", "The prospect of not being able to provide for your child is mortifying. I often saw the fear in my mum\u2019s eyes, and she was trying her very best to beat a system that felt like it was set up to fail her. Children can develop anxiety from as early as seven years old\u2014they can clearly read the environment they find themselves in. You end up seeing children trying to grow up too quickly. My goal is to see that children remain children for as long as possible, not carrying the weight of financial struggles. No child should have to be sat in a classroom worried about how they are going to eat that weekend.", "Can you talk us through the organizations that will benefit from your partnership with Burberry?", "Two of the organizations, Norbrook Youth Club and Woodhouse Park Lifestyle Centre, were actually my childhood youth centers [where I would go] every other evening. Youth centers and youth charities up and down the country have been financially hit because of the effects of the pandemic, and closing them down is like closing the heart of the community. The centers offer a level of stability and consistency that is unmatched in underprivileged communities, so Burberry and I wanted to make sure they were championed and offered every resource needed to carry on the great work they do for children all over the world, not just in the UK.", "How did those youth centers change your life and the lives of those around you for the better?", "I grew up in Wythenshawe [south Manchester], which at the time wasn\u2019t the safest place to be, yet it was a beacon of hope for so many. We were always taught to keep our heads down and keep quiet, yet at the same time, we would openly walk into neighbors\u2019 homes to check if there was anything to eat, without judgement or question. The youth center offered stability for us. It was where we felt most free. Knowing we were in a safe space that taught us about respect and discipline\u2014but more than anything, it was a guaranteed meal that day. I recently wrote on my social media that the youth centre was where friendships were made, where lessons were learned and where food was served. That pretty much sums it up. Growing up, it was an integral part of our lives."], "authors": ["Julia Hobbs", "Julia Hobb"], "keywords": ["marcus", "youth", "forces", "uniteds", "lives", "joins", "organizations", "centers", "children", "stability", "rashford", "global", "initiative", "charity", "burberry", "trying", "manchester", "taught", "struggles", "past"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
