Top of that list is a shortage of nursery schools.", "Europe\u2019s efforts to recover from covid-19 focus on poorer regions like Sicily. One of the aims of its \u20ac750bn recovery fund, currently blocked by Poland and Hungary (see article) but due to come on stream next year, is to \u201clevel up\u201d the EU . The Italian government will soon spell out to the European Commission how it wants to spend its share of the loans and grants on offer\u2014more than a quarter of the total, says the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. Last month, Sicily\u2019s regional government sent Rome a list of schemes it hopes will qualify for funding. But although the island\u2019s needs are great, the EU scheme may not help to satisfy them.", "Most of the projects the regional government wants for the island are large-scale, long-term and designed to fulfil relatively basic requirements. But the conditions attached to the EU \u2019s main recovery fund prioritise schemes that are \u201csmart\u201d, green and can be completed quite fast. Vincenzo Provenzano, who teaches economics at the university of Palermo, worries that the regional government\u2019s aims may be too ambitious and that it ought to focus more on the potential of the EU \u2019s promised Green Deal. \u201cIf we want to have immediate effects, we need to work on areas where Sicily has a comparative advantage,\u201d he says. Organic farming, which Sicily has a lot of, is a perfect example.", "Other doubts over Sicily\u2019s capacity to benefit from this unique opportunity have a longer history. The island\u2019s bureaucracy is notoriously sluggish. It may struggle to meet the deadlines set for having access to the EU \u2019s funds: 70% of the money has to be committed, with contracts awarded and signed, by the end of 2022, the remaining 30% within the year after. The entire fund has to be spent by the end of 2026. Sicily has in the past found it hard to devise projects suitable for EU funding and then spend the money it has been given.", "In any event, a worry persists that EU or state money invested in Sicily will enrich the island\u2019s Mafia, known to affiliates as Cosa Nostra (\u201cOur Thing\u201d). In this respect there are grounds for optimism. Once the beefiest of Italy\u2019s three main organised-crime syndicates, Cosa Nostra has been losing ground since the 1990s to the Camorra, which operates in and around Naples, and to the Calabrian \u2019Ndrangheta. Since the early 1990s police and prosecutors have relentlessly pursued it. Under Mr Musumeci, a former president of Sicily\u2019s anti-Mafia commission, they have had solid backing from the regional authorities.", "One reason Cosa Nostra has retreated from the streets is that it has increasingly concentrated on white-collar crime. As many investigations have shown, it is still able to muscle in on the allocation of contracts and has a special penchant for helping itself to EU financing."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["sicily", "islands", "nostra", "money", "s", "eus", "eu", "regional", "island", "cosying", "cosa", "fund", "sicilys", "desperate", "cash"], "pubDate": "2020-11-28T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
