His announcement on Sunday was greeted with celebrations on the streets of Baku as Azerbaijanis gathered to wave flags and sing.", "Officials from the Nagorno-Karabakh administration and Armenia\u2019s defence ministry denied Aliyev\u2019s statement, saying heavy fighting continued in the vicinity of the town, known in Armenian as Shushi.", "\u201cShushi remains an unattainable pipe dream for Azerbaijan. Despite heavy destruction, the fortress city withstands the blows of the enemy,\u201d the Nagorno-Karabakh rescue service said.", "As many as 5,000 people have died since Azerbaijan launched an offensive in late September to reclaim Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountain enclave, internationally recognised as Azerbaijani territory but under the de facto control of Armenians since a ceasefire was agreed between the two former Soviet neighbours in 1994.", "The war is complicated by the growing rivalry between Turkey and Russia for regional dominance. Azerbaijan has the outright support of Ankara, while Moscow, which sells arms to both sides, appears wary of honouring its military pact with Armenia if the violence extends outside the disputed territory.", "Shusha, Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s second biggest settlement, is a mountaintop town that was mostly populated by Azeris before the 1990s war. It is strategically located on the main corridor connecting the territory with Armenia and regarded by both sides as an important spiritual centre.", "Its Armenian Orthodox cathedral was hit by Azerbaijani shelling in October.

Both sides deny deliberately targeting civilian areas and the use of banned cluster-bomb munitions.", "Emboldened by Turkish support, Azerbaijan has gained the upper hand in the conflict, retaking much of the land in and around Nagorno-Karabakh occupied by Armenia that it lost in the previous war. Much of the gains are due to Azerbaijan\u2019s state-of-the-art military hardware, including the use of Turkish- and Israeli-made drones.", "Aliyev vowed on Sunday to continue the offensive until Armenia completely withdraws from the territory. Azerbaijan\u2019s chief ally, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, congratulated Aliyev on his Shusha victory later on Sunday.", "\u201cI congratulate my Azeri brothers\u2019 Shusha victory \u2026 I believe [it] is a sign that the rest of the occupied lands will be liberated soon too,\u201d said Erdo\u011fan, addressing crowds in Turkey\u2019s north-west province of Kocaeli.", "Two Russian and one US brokered ceasefire to date have done nothing to stop the hostilities, with each side immediately accusing the other of violations.", "The fierce fighting over the weekend comes amid reports that Ankara and Moscow have drawn up a draft ceasefire deal under which Armenia would surrender five of the seven Azerbaijani regions it currently occupies and agree to the establishment of a new corridor connecting Baku to the Azerbaijan territory of Nakhchivan, which is surrounded by Armenian land.", "Turkish and Russian peacekeeping forces would then be deployed to uphold the ceasefire, Middle East Eye reported."], "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan"], "keywords": ["azerbaijan", "territory", "armenian", "nagornokarabakh", "claims", "captured", "sides", "town", "ceasefire", "key", "armenia", "fighting", "azerbaijani"], "pubDate": "2020-11-08T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
