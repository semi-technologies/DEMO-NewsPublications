Christie said,", "\"If you go anywhere else in the world. And you say to people, if you can have one place you'd want to go other than where you live. The overwhelming majority people in this world say they want to come to America. This is the place that has to remain as the shining light of freedom and liberty and prosperity and capitalism and democracy. And the only way that happens if we participate. And so you've got to get out there tomorrow and vote no matter who you're going to vote for. If you haven't voted already, filling your ballot and drop it off in a Dropbox or if you can go to a poll and then letting you do that in your state get there, because I really believe this. If you don't vote, you forfeit your right to complain. And so if you want to complain, gosh, Americans love to state their opinion. You want to do that, then earn that right by getting out to the polls and voting for the person, you think is the best person to lead this country for the next four years. And I'll tell you, as a candidate, there's nothing that invigorates you more than watching people lining up at a voting booth to go and vote knowing your name's on that ballot. It could be a wonderful affirmation or a rejection. I've had both in my career, but both of them are gratifying because, you know, that people cared enough to show up and let their voice be heard.\""], "authors": ["Wyatt Dobrovichfago"], "keywords": ["vote", "christie", "person", "forfeit", "urges", "say", "americans", "state", "voting", "right", "dont", "chris", "place", "world", "complain"], "pubDate": "2020-11-02T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
