But a group of tourists are taking pictures, and flower seller Michael Saarloos, 65, sighs. \u201cAh, well, only four weeks to go.\u201d", "He has been working at the market for forty-five years, but he announced he was moving his shop, and it made international headlines. He shows us the Guardian\u2019s website on his phone: Amsterdam\u2019s Last Floating Florist Closes, Blaming Tourists.", "\u201cI want to keep the business going, but not here,\u201d says his son Julien, 26. \u201cIf you want to survive in this place, you do what everyone else does: you sell bulbs, clogs, and souvenirs. That\u2019s not my idea of fun.\u201d", "So the shop is relocating to nearby Gasthuismolensteeg. \u201cWe\u2019re very busy, no thanks to the tourists,\u201d says Michael. \u201cThey just make things more difficult by standing around and getting in the way.\u201d", "\u201cParis, Rome, Bangkok, lots of other cities have proper flower markets,\u201d adds Julien. \u201cAnd here in Amsterdam, which is famous for its flowers, there\u2019s nothing left. Tourists come and ask us where the rest of the flower stalls are, and I just feel embarrassed.\u201d", "Not the bulb season", "A process that began in the 1990s is almost complete. Even then, Amsterdammers were increasingly buying their flowers from other flower shops, big garden centres, and supermarkets. Back in 1993, three of the seventeen stalls had been converted into souvenir shops and there were concerns for the market\u2019s survival.", "So the city imposed a covenant to prevent the place from turning into a souvenir market, requiring the stalls to devote no more than 25 percent of their space to tourist trinkets, with the rest being given over to flowers, plants, shrubs, trees, seeds, and bulbs.", "This did not have the desired effect. The displays have become increasingly monotonous over the past ten years, and now consist largely of bulbs and souvenirs, complying with the letter but not the spirit of the covenant.", "\u201cWe think the market is a very sad place,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 Hoogendijk, the KAVB\u2019s deputy director. \u201cIt\u2019s a tourist trap full of junk and past-dated bulbs.\u201d", "He points out that there are no garden centres selling tulip bulbs right now, because the season runs from September to December.\u201c If they don\u2019t overwinter in the ground, they don\u2019t grow. The whole thing is a mess. They\u2019re selling remaindered stock at exorbitant prices.\u201d", "If the bulbs do sprout, they\u2019re often not what the customer paid for. \u201cLook at the stalls selling blue tulips. Our association is like the central registry for all of the world\u2019s tulips: we have more than eight thousand of them, and not one is blue. There\u2019s no such colour. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d", "Purple is almost blue", "The market vendors will tell you to chill the bulbs if you want them to germinate, and they\u2019ll claim that purple tulips look almost blue. It\u2019s like buying Olay: it\u2019s the appearance of youth that matters, not the reality. Spend a day hanging around at the market, and they\u2019ll say people who work with bulbs are no angels, there\u2019s nothing wrong with putting the occasional red one in the bag if you\u2019re out of orange, and if it weren\u2019t for tulip bulbs the market would have shut down years ago.", "Saarloos\u2019 colleagues say he should stop complaining and flogging a dead horse, and simply adapt to the market. And if he really hates tourists so much, why has he now bought a pancake shop at the market?", "\u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut pancakes are nothing to do with flowers. My daughter\u2019s going to run it, and it\u2019s just an investment for me. They\u2019re just jealous because they all wanted to get their hands on the shop.\u201d", "Crown imperials", "So things aren\u2019t as bad as they seem at the market, and the flowers aren\u2019t about to disappear. At least not according to Felipe Liebano, co-owner of Laddrak Bouquet, which runs five bulb and souvenir stalls and has acquired Sarloos\u2019s. \u201cI like flowers, and I want to learn the business and continue selling them there,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just flowers, because you have to make a living, but they won\u2019t completely disappear.\u201d", "But how far can you trust a business when a recent TV investigation found it to be selling bags containing fewer than the advertised number of bulbs? It\u2019s also selling crown imperial fritillary bulbs for \u20ac3.50 each \u2013 popular with tourists, but you won\u2019t find them on sale anywhere else in the Netherlands at this time of year. \u201cThe bulbs in that bag are real,\u201d says Liebano. \u201cOne hundred percent. We refrigerate our bulbs properly.\u201d A few hours later, when we return it and tell him it\u2019s not a crown imperial fritillary but a tuberose, he says: \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t a nice thing for the supplier to do. We\u2019ve stopped selling them.\u201d"], "authors": ["Lex Boon", "Translation", "Het Vertaalcollectief"], "keywords": ["dont", "selling", "stalls", "theres", "market", "tulip", "sold", "flowers", "tourists", "bloemenmarkt", "flower", "bulbs", "tulips", "theyre"], "pubDate": "2019-10-23T06:26:36Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
