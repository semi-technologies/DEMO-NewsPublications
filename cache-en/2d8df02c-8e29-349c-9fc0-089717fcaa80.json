But the tune soon changed and Boris Johnson has gone from \u201cMr Brexit to Mr U-turn\u201d, in the words of one German newspaper, as he has lurched from disaster to disaster.", "Here we trace the winding road of his government\u2019s many U-turns.", "Mass community testing", "12 March 2020", "One of the earliest and perhaps most damaging of the volte-faces of Johnson\u2019s government was the decision to end the mass testing programme despite advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) that it was vital. Instead, Johnson announced that health workers would focus solely on testing those already in need of hospital care.", "The decision appeared all the more bizarre because the previous day NHS England had announced a \u201csignificant expansion of coronavirus testing\u201d and insisted that the demand for tests had never exceeded its existing capacity.", "Announcing the decision, Johnson said: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d", "The visa surcharge", "21 May 2020", "Johnson backed away from a policy that would have required people coming to the UK to work for the NHS to pay a health surcharge of hundreds of pounds, after criticism from his own party that it was \u201cmean-spirited and immoral\u201d.", "The prime minister waved away Labour pleas to exempt NHS staff \u2013 many of whom are on the minimum wage \u2013 from the charge, claiming it would contribute about \u00a3900m per year.

He thanked Rashford for helping bring it to his attention, and the footballer later became an MBE.", "The NHS app", "18 June 2020", "In April the health secretary Matt Hancock, trumpeted plans for an NHS mobile app that he said would be \u201ccrucial\u201d to stopping the virus spreading.
