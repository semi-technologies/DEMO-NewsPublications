Senator Ted Cruz of Texas might not have been quite right when he said that, after all, President Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t campaign on cutting the debt.\u201d Actually, Mr. Trump did, but in a throwaway manner, while putting more stress on continued, even increased, big spending and debt.", "And as is so often the case with one-party control, as in Mr. Trump\u2019s first years, big spending took hold. According to the Cato Institute, over Mr. Trump\u2019s four years, spending went up by a total of 10 percent. Something similar happened under George W. Bush: Spending shot up 24 percent.", "But what really seems like an effective arrangement for controlling spending is a Democratic president with Republicans in charge of at least one body of Congress. During the first four years of the Barack Obama and Bill Clinton administrations, both of which included years of split control of government, spending was more restrained or even reduced. Under Mr. Clinton, spending inched up only 3 percent. In Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, total spending actually went down by 10 percent.", "There are ways beyond the budget that a Biden presidency could be a boon to libertarians. Mr. Trump was a disaster when it came to free trade, kicking off a huge trade war with China and \u201crenegotiating\u201d NAFTA so that it contained more protectionist, anti-free-market measures like wage controls.", "By contrast, Mr. Biden will probably cut a more pro-trade profile. Congressional Republicans and Democrats were reluctant to give Mr. Trump trade negotiating authority, but they are more likely to give Mr. Biden that authority than they are to withhold it (despite some pressure from the party\u2019s progressives like Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez)."], "authors": ["Liz Mair"], "keywords": ["mr", "total", "libertarians", "deficit", "trump", "hawks", "election", "york", "worked", "trade", "republicans", "spending", "times", "control", "went", "trumps", "biden"], "pubDate": "2020-11-08T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
