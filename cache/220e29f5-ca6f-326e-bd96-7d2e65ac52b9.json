{"pubDate": null, "title": "Sunday Reading: The World of Calvin Tomkins", "paragraphs": ["In an interview in 2014, Calvin Tomkins remarked that he doesn\u2019t believe art can be defined. \u201cArt is too diffuse, too vital. It\u2019s always growing and changing,\u201d he observed. The same could be said for Tomkins and the evolution of his work. He has been a staff writer and an art critic at The New Yorker for more than five decades, contributing nearly four hundred pieces to the magazine since 1958. Over his long career, he has published masterly profiles of visual artists and creative virtuosos, including Marcel Duchamp, Robert Rauschenberg, John Currin, Julia Child, Frank Gehry, and many more. His pieces are marked by a keen eye for detail and an elegant understanding of an artist\u2019s relationship to her work. He has also authored eighteen books, including \u201cMerchants and Masterpieces: The Story of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u201d and \u201cDuchamp: A Biography.\u201d His new anthology, a six-volume set of eighty-two of his most significant profiles, titled \u201cThe Lives of Artists: Collected Profiles,\u201d was published on October 2nd.", "This week, we\u2019re bringing you a selection of Tomkins\u2019s pieces from the magazine. In \u201cHer Secret Identities,\u201d he profiles the influential photographer and portrait artist Cindy Sherman. In \u201cInto the Unknown,\u201d he examines the innovative work of the painter Chris Ofili and writes about the opening of a major retrospective of Ofili\u2019s pieces at the New Museum. In \u201cThe Man Who Walks on Air,\u201d he traces the journey of the intrepid high-wire artist Philippe Petit. In a piece from 1974, he visits the legendary painter Georgia O\u2019Keeffe at her home in Ghost Ranch, in Abiqui\u00fa, New Mexico, and explores her evolution as an artist. In \u201cA Sense of Place,\u201d he chronicles the career of the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, who designed the National Museum of African American History and Culture, in Washington, D.C., among other buildings. Finally, in \u201cLiving Well Is the Best Revenge,\u201d he recounts the lives of Sara and Gerald Murphy, the couple who were the inspiration for F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cTender is the Night.\u201d We hope that you enjoy these glimpses into a creative mind at work.", "\u2014David Remnick", "Photograph by Martin Schoeller / Saba", "Cindy Sherman\u2019s art is as mysterious as ever.
