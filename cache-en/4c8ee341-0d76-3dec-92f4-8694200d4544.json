In most places, I have to tell you, we are not quite there yet, and the pressures on the NHS remain.\u201d", "In tier 3, the strictest level of restrictions, hospitality businesses must close except for takeaway services. In tier 2 they can open but customers can only sit inside with other members of their household or bubble. People can mix with up to five other people in beer gardens and on outside tables in tier 2.", "Stephen McPartland, the Tory MP for Stevenage in Hertfordshire, tweeted: \u201cRidiculous that we are being dragged into tier 3. Totally unacceptable & clearly shows I was right to vote against a second lockdown and tier system.\u201d", "Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Portsmouth council, said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d to move the city into tier 3 but not nearby areas also served by the city\u2019s hospital.", "He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not unexpected but I am slightly surprised as we have been told the problem is the Queen Alexandra hospital, which doesn\u2019t just serve Portsmouth. Just a third of its intake is from Portsmouth and two-thirds from others around including areas which are within a mile.\u201d", "The lack of any movement out of tier 3 for areas in the north and Midlands also brought a strong reaction, with Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, calling it \u201cbitterly disappointing so close to Christmas\u201d.", "In a joint statement, the leaders of councils in north-east England said that while they accepted the region had to stay in tier 3 on public health grounds, they needed \u201ca greater understanding of how moving out of tier 3 will be determined in the new year\u201d.", "Responding to Hancock in the Commons, the Conservative backbencher Sir Graham Brady, who represents Altrincham and Sale West, noted that infection rates were below the national average in nine out of 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester, and lower than in Bristol or Cheshire, both now in tier 2. \u201cWhat exactly do we have to do to move out of tier 3?\u201d Brady said.", "For the past week, political and business leaders in the north and Midlands \u2013 large parts of which have been under strict lockdown restrictions since the summer \u2013 have been making the case to the government for their areas to be downgraded to tier 2. But those pleas fell on deaf ears amid warnings from health experts that the virus is already out of control again in the run-up Christmas.", "In the Commons, Hancock also came under pressure over the government\u2019s plans to allow households to meet at Christmas, given the still-rising Covid case numbers.", "Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about cancelling Christmas, Santa will still deliver his presents. But is he really telling us that allowing indoor mixing of three households, across regions and generations, for five days is sensible given the virus is raging with such ferocity at the moment?\u201d", "Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and chair of the Commons health committee, also sought clarification over Christmas plans. He said: \u201cOf course, personal responsibility matters. But in a pandemic, so does clarity. So irrespective of the law and the regulations, should we or should we not have indoor social gatherings with elderly and vulnerable family members?\u201d", "Hancock, in response, said people \u201cshould act with great caution\u201d.", "London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire entered tier 3 on Wednesday, meaning 38 million people will be living under the toughest level of restrictions \u2013 68% of the population of England.
