We hope it will bring some joy to your reading list.", "\u201cMatt loves to tell this long-winded\u2014and untrue\u2014story about how he hired me,\u201d jokes Sita Chantramonklasri, of how she and her now husband Matthew Lee met at work. The two dated for about four years before getting engaged at Blackberry Farm, a resort on a 4,200 acre estate situated amidst the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. \u201cWe usually go once a year as a mini tradition,\u201d Sita explains.", "A few months after they moved back to New York following a stint in London, Matt planned a surprise trip there. \u201cI suspected where we were going a few days earlier, but did not want to ruin his efforts!\u201d she admits. \u201cThe day we arrived, he told me we were going to meet farmer John, who we adore, at the barn, but on the way, he took me to the boat house that was covered with sunflowers and candles, and he proposed. He jokes that even though I knew he was going to propose when we left our cottage, I chose to pack a cookie instead of a camera.\u201d", "After the engagement, they started planning their wedding in Sita\u2019s home country of Thailand for February 16th through the 22nd. \u201cWe wanted to showcase the amazing food, beautiful flowers, and unique culture of Thailand, so we chose to highlight the specific aspect of each place, from Bangkok to Chiang Mai to Phuket,\u201d Sita explains. \u201cIt felt more like a vacation with our family and friends than a wedding, which was exactly what we wanted.\u201d The couple worked with Easton Events to achieve their multi-day, multi-city celebration, which started in Bangkok. \u201cThey\u2019re a team of creative geniuses,\u201d Sita says.", "The bride tried to infuse that sense of creativity into her wardrobe as well. \u201cSince I spend the vast majority of my time wearing somewhat boring neutral colored basics [due to my job working in finance], I really wanted to use this whole week as an excuse to dress up!\u201d Sita says.", "At the first event in Bangkok, Sita wore an embroidered pink Carolina Herrera gown. Then, for the Thai ceremony in Chiang Mai, she went with a traditional Thai outfit and jewelry. \u201cThe shawl had Matt and my names embroidered in it in Thai,\u201d Sita says. For the reception that followed, she changed into a custom Asava gown. \u201cHe is an incredible Thai designer who went above and beyond to deliver what was really a dream outfit that sadly I will probably never have the chance to wear again!\u201d Later in the week, when the wedding party traveled to their final destination in Phuket, Sita wore a custom Sahroo two-piece for the welcome party. \u201cOne of my close friends works for her and recommended her,\u201d the bride explains. \u201cI loved it as it felt a lot more like my personality. I like to wear pants.\u201d For the rehearsal dinner the night before the western wedding, she wore a Giambattista Valli dress with soft floral undertones in nude pink.\u201d", "", "After going to countless wedding designers in search of the perfect dress for her Western ceremony, Sita realized that while she liked a lot of the ones she\u2019d seen, none of them felt like they really fit her. \u201cI had a pretty clear vision of what I wanted for my main gown for the Western ceremony so I knew I needed something custom,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted it to feel traditional yet untraditional and unique to our relationship.\u201d With the help of stylist Carrie Goldberg, Sita was able to create a custom dress with Hermione de Paula in London. The train of the dress had references to the couple\u2019s story and travels sewn into it, and the designer incorporated a nude and blush floral garden on top of it. During the ceremony, Sita had a long-sleeve bodice on for a more traditional look, and for the reception, she took off her train so she could dance in her gown.", "", "The Thai ceremony was formal and very special to the couple and their families. It started with a traditional gatecrashing parade: \u201cMatt had to go through different obstacles, and each \u2018gate\u2019 was guarded by my bridal party,\u201d Sita explains. \u201cHe had to do push ups, make up a rhyme or rap about me, pick which chicken bone was the one I ate, etc. My friends designed each obstacle, and it was absolutely hilarious. After the gatecrashing parade, Matt had to formally ask my parents for their permission for my hand in marriage and then we had a formal Buddhist monk blessing followed by a water blessing. We felt like it was really special for us to have our friends from abroad witness a whole different culture as well.\u201d", "A formal dinner set under a light structure, in Thai architectural style, was served after the service. \u201cDespite everyone\u2019s attire and the setting, it almost felt a bit casual as everyone was so eager to see each other and rotate between tables,\u201d Sita remembers. \u201cWe wanted to pay tribute to Matt's Chinese heritage so we served fine-dining Chinese food, which is actually often the tradition for Thai weddings.\u201d There were fire dancers and traditional Thai dancers at various intervals during the dinner. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect there to be dancing afterwards,\u201d Sita says. \u201cBut everyone jumped in the middle of the space and made a make-shift dance floor\u2014we all had a blast!\u201d", "At the beginning of the Western ceremony a few days later, Sita walked down the aisle in her Hermione de Paula dress. This service was very personal, as this is when the couple shared the vows they\u2019d written themselves. \u201cIt was funny to see that both of us referenced almost the exact same jokes and roasted each other a little bit during our vows,\u201d Sita notes. \u201cWe were surprised and touched to see so many of our friends and family tearing up through their laughter. It all felt so joyous,\u201d Sita says. \u201cWe both joke around with each other a lot and felt like though this was an important moment, it was no different.\u201d", "The reception at Amanpuri following the Western ceremony was the finale event and a final send off for many of the guests in attendance. Each table held oversized tropical flowers that sat high above each guest, and there was a floating floor surrounded by large lotus flowers. Elan Artists provided the entertainment. \u201cThe band, \u00c9lan International Band, was truly better than what we could have hoped for,\u201d Sita says. \u201cEveryone was on the dance floor throughout dinner. At one rare point when we were all seated, \u2018Shallow\u2019 came on, and our friends got so excited that they all immediately jumped up because they just had to dance to it.\u201d After midnight, there were fireworks and a traditional cake cutting. Then, late night, a small group made their way back to one of the villas in Amanpuri for the after-party. \u201cThe pool was lit up beautifully with white lights,\u201d Sita remembers. \u201cBites were passed around and our guests were in and out of the photo booth until morning.\u201d"], "authors": ["Alexandra Macon", "Alexandra Maco"], "keywords": ["traditional", "friends", "mai", "chiang", "wanted", "phuket", "thailand", "sita", "western", "ceremony", "felt", "thai", "wedding", "dress", "tour", "doubled"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
