He was referring, vaguely and falsely, to the process of counting votes cast in the Presidential election, and echoing President Trump\u2019s claim, in an appearance at the White House earlier that evening, that \u201chorror stories\u201d regarding the vote count abounded. The horror for Trump is that he is losing: as the votes have been counted, his early leads in Michigan and Wisconsin have disappeared; he has fallen behind in the ongoing counts in Georgia and Pennsylvania; and he has so far failed to catch up in Arizona or Nevada, where he is narrowly trailing. Trump seems to see a single path to victory: baselessly blame everybody in sight, buy time in court, and see if his problems will just go away. The plan gets a little fuzzy at that last point, but the first two steps are clear: slander and sue. At the White House, he said, falsely, \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous litigation going on, and this is a case where they\u2019re trying to steal an election.\u201d", "At this point, the litigation is not, for the most part, tremendous, or even about specific allegations of fraud. This may be because there is no real evidence of widespread fraud anywhere in any of these states. (Systemic issues regarding voter suppression are another matter.) Instead, most of the lawsuits are about circumstances that Trump and his team have decided might lead to fraud. In many cases, Trump and his allies are lying about what those circumstances are, and even about the substance of many of the lawsuits that his campaign has filed.", "For example, at the White House, Trump, referring to one of his campaign\u2019s suits in Pennsylvania, said that the state had been trying to \u201cban our election observers and very strongly\u201d; he said that the state didn\u2019t \u201cwant anybody watching them as they count the ballots . . . they\u2019re trying, obviously, to commit fraud.\u201d On Twitter, he went further, saying that observers hadn\u2019t been let in \u201cin any way, shape, or form.\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, in his own appearance on Hannity\u2019s show on Thursday, said that Philadelphia was \u201cnot allowing election observers in,\u201d adding that \u201cevery time they close the doors and shut out the lights they always find more Democratic votes.\u201d This is a fantasy; in fact, the only real dispute in the litigation turned out to be how many observers there could be in the Philadelphia convention center, where the votes were being tabulated, and how close they could stand to election workers. (There is a pandemic to consider.) No doors have been closed; no lights have been shut; there is even a live stream of what\u2019s going on inside. And, by Thursday night, even the technical issues seemed largely resolved after a state-court judge said that the observers could come within six feet, and a federal judge\u2014the Trump team was trying its luck in both venues\u2014dismissed the matter, with instructions, according to the A.P., that both sides work out an agreement to adjust the number of observers, like \u201cresponsible adults.\u201d (Good luck.)", "The cases include one about fifty-three supposedly late-arriving absentee ballots in Georgia, and video cameras observing ballot drop boxes in Michigan; both of those were dismissed by the first judges who heard them, and, although they may be appealed, the lack of substance is striking. A Nevada woman\u2019s tale of a supposedly stolen ballot was highlighted at a Trump campaign press conference, but Nevada officials say that she declined to give them an official statement. There is one notable exception to what is otherwise a pattern of high-stakes nuisance lawsuits, though, and it is in Pennsylvania: Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Kathy Boockvar et al. (Boockvar is Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of state.) The Trump campaign petitioned the Supreme Court for permission to join the case on Wednesday. This case, which the Pennsylvania G.O.P. brought to the Supreme Court in September, concerns the date by which Pennsylvania\u2019s mail-in ballots need to arrive. Under state law, the deadline is Election Day, but, in pandemic-related litigation, Pennsylvania\u2019s highest state court extended that to Friday, as long as the ballot is postmarked by Election Day. (There is a side dispute about how legible the postmark has to be.)", "There are real legal issues there\u2014the central question is how state election rules, which, according to the Constitution, are the purview of the state legislature, are limited by state constitutions, and what judges get to say about that\u2014but, again, no specific accusations of actual, rather than potential, fraud. The Pennsylvania G.O.P. has asked the Supreme Court to hear the case on an expedited basis; a couple of days before the election, that petition was denied. In a statement accompanying the denial, Justice Samuel Alito regretted that it couldn\u2019t be heard in time and indicated that he thought that the Court should hear it at some point. If it does, one of the Justices with a chance to decide the case will be Amy Coney Barrett.", "At any rate, because of the possibility of further litigation, Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general instructed election offices to segregate any ballots that arrived between eight P.M. Tuesday and five P.M. Friday. This means that, even if the Supreme Court finds that these specific ballots came in too late, they can simply be left out of the count. They will not taint the tally as a whole. The real question at this point may not be whether the Supreme Court rules for Trump but whether the number of ballots in question\u2014which is not yet final\u2014even makes a difference in Biden\u2019s margin of victory in the state, which is growing. (It is possible, too, that Biden can get the two hundred and seventy electoral votes he needs to win the Presidency without Pennsylvania\u2019s twenty electors.) The math should be clearer by the end of Friday.", "In short, no one is trying to commit fraud, except the President. When Trump says, as he did at the White House, \u201cIf you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,\u201d he is doing more than lying. He is defining \u201clegal\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d in an entirely political manner\u2014one helps Trump, and the other doesn\u2019t. He and his allies hardly try to hide that. For example, one of the obvious hypocrisies is that Trump keeps demanding that the vote be stopped in states where his lead is evaporating but continued in Arizona, where he believes he has a shot at catching up with Biden. Lindsey Graham offered Hannity this explanation for that disparity: \u201cI trust Arizona; I don\u2019t trust Philadelphia.\u201d Graham said that Philadelphia elections\u2014all of them, apparently\u2014are as \u201ccrooked as a snake.\u201d", "When Hannity pushed the view that Pennsylvania was just so hopelessly corrupt that none of its numbers could be trusted, and that the state\u2019s legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, should just declare the whole election invalid, Graham said, \u201cI think everything should be on the table.\u201d The Pennsylvania legislature is under Republican control, and one Trumpian dream is that the legislature just picks the state\u2019s electors themselves, as was the case early in the Republic, though it\u2019s far from clear that they have the power to do so. (They have delegated the power to voters under state law, after all.) If they tried, the litigation would, indeed, be spectacular. Even Cruz, when Hannity posed the same scenario to him, called invalidating the election \u201ca big cannon to use.\u201d There will likely also be litigation once the recounts that are expected in other close states, such as Wisconsin and Georgia, get under way. The aim may be to delay certification of the results and thus interfere with the appointment of electors. But that\u2019s an extreme long shot because the problems, as far as we\u2019ve seen, just aren\u2019t there\u2014not even notionally\u2014and because Biden is now ahead in too many states. (This isn\u2019t 2000, when it was all about Florida.) Anyone seeking a rich debate on constitutional law or the gray areas of election rules should probably look elsewhere; the President\u2019s legal strategy is about smears and a fight for power. Soon enough, the legal effort may be nothing more than a vehicle that allows him to air his grievances but which goes nowhere\u2014the disorganized clattering of a defeated President on the way out.", "The legal effort is also becoming an exercise in showing loyalty to Trump. Graham told Hannity, \u201cI\u2019m gonna donate five-hundred thousand dollars tonight to President Trump\u2019s defense legal fund.\u201d He urged Hannity\u2019s viewers to give as well: \u201cDonald J. Trump dot com\u2014five bucks from a million people goes a long way.\u201d His appearance, and Ted Cruz\u2019s, came after both Eric and Donald Trump, Jr., complained that Republicans weren\u2019t helping, and it can\u2019t be called anything but shameful; the question now is how many others in the G.O.P. share in the ignominy. Kevin McCarthy, the House Minority Leader, also appeared that night, on Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News program, to voice his support for the President. Graham said that \u201cevery Senate Republican and House Republican needs to get on television and tell this story.\u201d And what a wild story it is.", "Read More About the 2020 Election"], "authors": ["Amy Davidson Sorkin", "Amy Davidson Sorki", "Eliza Griswol", "Benjamin Wallace-Well"], "keywords": ["legal", "pennsylvania", "trumpist", "strategy", "trump", "litigation", "trumps", "court", "states", "state", "challenging", "votes", "observers", "election", "fantasy"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
