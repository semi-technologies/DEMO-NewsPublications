It\u2019s a little like Marylebone \u2013 quite residential and one step away from the galleries and big stores in the city centre, and there are lots of schools and families too. We have a typical 1930s apartment, with two bedrooms \u2013 a complete luxury in Paris \u2013 and an old-fashioned lift in wood and metal. It\u2019s incredibly peaceful, apart from the motorbikes that echo through the courtyard. Paris is not a relaxing city; it\u2019s very hard to find a quiet spot anywhere.", "On Saturday morning I often go to see any new pastry shops that have opened and one of my favourites is P\u00e2tisserie Gilles Marchal. It\u2019s tiny but worth going up the hill towards Montmartre for, and it\u2019s good exercise. There are fantastic cakes, Viennoiserie and biscuits, and everything is made in the studio at the back. I\u2019ll buy a coffee and some madeleines \u2013 they are the best in Paris.", "On the way back home I\u2019ll stop off at Oh My Cream!, a fantastic beauty shop that stocks lots of American brands that are hard to find here, such as Tata Harper \u2013 I love her natural oils, and the smell of everything she makes is wonderful. I\u2019ll also buy some creams by Susanne Kaufmann.", "After a quick sandwich at home, I\u2019ll go to Le Bon March\u00e9. They\u2019ve redone the whole store and it\u2019s a wonderful place to browse \u2013 I love the \u00e9picerie and the homeware department, where I stock up on sheets and linens. I have three grandchildren now, so the children\u2019s department on the third floor is another place where I can spend lots of money.", "Advertisement", "I used to go to galleries a lot and I feel ashamed that I don\u2019t visit them more often so I will go to La Maison Rouge, an independent gallery that shows private collections of contemporary art from around the world. It\u2019s a beautiful space and always has interesting exhibitions.", "If it\u2019s sunny I will go and get myself some English books from WHSmith on Rue de Rivoli and then have a wander around the Tuileries Garden opposite. Jean-Charles is usually working on Saturdays so I will treat myself to tea at Toraya, which is close by. It\u2019s one of the few places that I really enjoy \u2013 it\u2019s so serene and calming with a lot of pale wood, very Japanese. The food is simple and there\u2019s not much choice but it\u2019s perfect; they have a tray with little bowls of different vegetables, an egg dish, miso and lovely tea and they bring you a Japanese cake afterwards. It\u2019s fabulous. You feel very good about it because it\u2019s wholesome and healthy.", "We often have Mondays off, so sometimes on Sunday we go to our house in Normandy. If we stay in Paris, eating out can be tricky as so much is closed \u2013 one of my favourite new restaurants, La Bourse et La Vie, was opened by an American serving classic French bistro food in a long, elegant restaurant that\u2019s very Parisian. He brings a lovely goug\u00e8re, a cheese puff pastry, to the table instead of bread and it\u2019s just to die for. His steak and chips are the best in Paris. But he\u2019s not open on Sundays. Instead I\u2019d opt for lunch at a Japanese noodle place, and our favourite is Kunitoraya \u2013 there is no booking and it\u2019s easy food. I normally have the bowl of udon noodles with either the tofu or deep-fried prawns.", "Sunday night, we might go and see a film at a small cinema, the Gaumont in the Op\u00e9ra district, which shows lots of foreign-language films. My husband likes intellectual films because he comes from the heartland of pure French cinema, so he sniffs at anything that\u2019s American. But I quite like blockbusters, so we have to compromise."]}
