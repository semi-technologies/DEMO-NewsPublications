He found her attractive, but was nervous about speaking to her. \u201cI went to her room to ask, but every time I plucked up courage, I would hear her hair dryer going.\u201d", "Eventually, he succeeded and they went for drinks. \u201cHe wore a shell suit and trainers \u2013 I asked him to go back and change,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ve never worn a shell suit since,\u201d adds Ian.", "Linda thought Ian was a \u201clovely man\u201d but wasn\u2019t convinced there was a spark. However, they got on extremely well as friends. \u201cWe spent every day together,\u201d she says. On the second night of the trip Ian found a gold dolphin charm that fallen from someone\u2019s necklace and gave it to Linda. \u201cI had it mended and put it on one of my chains,\u201d she says.", "Ian was only in Greece for a week, while Linda was staying for a fortnight. \u201cWhen he left, I really missed his company. We exchanged numbers, though.\u201d", "Three weeks after she returned home, Ian visited on her birthday weekend. \u201cI was definitely very impressed by Linda. I drove 221 miles to see her,\u201d he says.", "Before he arrived Linda still thought of the relationship as a friendship, but it was soon clear that there was romantic chemistry. \u201cI\u2019d invited friends for dinner on the Saturday evening in case things weren\u2019t working out well with Ian\u2019s visit. All through dinner, we both just wished they weren\u2019t there.\u201d", "They became a couple that weekend and a few weeks later Linda went to see Ian in Hull. \u201cI was one of those people who never really left London so I had no idea where I was going,\u201d she recalls. From then on, they spent every weekend together, as well as Christmas and New Year.", "Ian and Linda, both keen travellers, were married in Kenya.

Keen on travel, they decided to marry in Kenya in 1992, and throw a party when they got home. Two years later, their first son was born, followed by his brother in 1996.", "\u201cAs well as travelling, we love going out to eat, to the theatre and entertaining friends,\u201d says Ian. \u201cWe really enjoy sport, such as boxing and rugby too,\u201d says Linda. She now works for a children\u2019s charity, and writes short stories, novels and plays. \u201cWe\u2019ve got on so well during lockdown. For years Ian has worked away in the week, so it\u2019s been nice to have him at home. We also have one of our sons staying with us at the moment.\u201d After celebrating their silver (25th) wedding anniversary in Lefkada, the couple are keen to go back for their 30th anniversary in 2022. \u201cWe want to get a big villa and have the boys with us,\u201d says Linda.", "\u2022 Want to share your story?
