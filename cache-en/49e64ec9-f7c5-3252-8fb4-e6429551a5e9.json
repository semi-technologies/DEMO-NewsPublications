Each circle represents a person (or group of people if you\u2019re on a device with a small screen) and scrolling the timeline will update the charts to show where people were at each point in time.", "The timeline shows important events and also highlights the stories of some of the people who have been through Australia\u2019s offshore processing system.", "Notes and methods", "All the data in this project comes from official government sources. They include answers to questions at Senate estimates, annual reports, Operation Sovereign Borders public updates, submissions to parliamentary inquiries, answers to questions at parliamentary inquiries, weekly statistics from the Department of Home Affairs released under freedom of information laws, and monthly detention statistics and other documents periodically published on the department\u2019s website. A small number of the statistics on release from detention in Nauru are sourced from Nauruan government media announcements.", "This project focuses on the 3,127 people sent to offshore detention after 19 July 2013.", "At the time of Rudd\u2019s announcement, there were already a number of asylum seekers detained on Nauru and Manus Island. Some of those people necessarily appear in our early population counts of Manus and Nauru, as the government data does not distinguish between people who were transferred after 19 July and people who were there before.", "But the government quickly transferred the vast majority of the people who were already there back to Australia to make room for people who arrived after 19 July. The exception was a small number of people facing criminal charges or serving sentences. Those people were all returned by April 2015.", "You can read more detail about the data here."], "authors": ["Hannah Ryan", "Nick Evershed", "Andy Ball", "Alexandra Spring"], "keywords": ["processing", "australia", "happened", "detention", "australias", "caught", "asylum", "statistics", "regime", "seekers", "person", "offshore", "nauru", "small", "interactive", "number", "timeline"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
