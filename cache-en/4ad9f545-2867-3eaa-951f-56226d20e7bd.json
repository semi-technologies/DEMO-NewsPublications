The year has called for entertainment that inspires, uplifts, and (momentarily) distracts. It would be easy to dive into Netflix and find an old favorite, but Emily Blunt and Jamie Dornan\u2019s latest film provides a welcome new fantasy. Wild Mountain Thyme is the kind of quirky romance that takes viewers into a whole new world, namely the Irish countryside\u2019s endless greenery. As Rosemary Muldoon, the story\u2019s unflappable heroine, Blunt sets out to make magic happen with her bashful suitor and childhood friend, Dornan\u2019s Anthony Reilly. A reversal from the usual boy-chases-girl rom-com, director John Patrick Shanley\u2019s script felt wholly original, which is exactly what drew Blunt to the project. \u201cSo often I read scripts that are usually a bit derivative of one another, especially with romantic stories. The characters often are a curated version of a romantic lead, so I was bewitched by the fact that there was a romance with two strange, odd, and uncertain people,\u201d she shared on the phone from Manhattan. \u201cIt was just the most unique little fairytale I\u2019d ever read.\u201d", "The characters\u2019 idiosyncrasies are reflected in their wardrobe. Rosemary\u2019s clothes are appropriate for her life on the farm, but they\u2019re also colorful and ethereal. Think blue and red tartan jackets worn over gauzy tiered skirts, plenty of floral prints, and of course, a wealth of good boots. Created by costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone, the pieces reflect Rosemary\u2019s free spirit.. \u201cShanley and I talked about her as someone who is very expressive with her clothes, and it\u2019s all really like those birds of paradise who dance to attract a mate,\u201d says Blunt. \u201cShe has this wild style, and it\u2019s a bit mismatched.\u201d During a pre-production fitting with Walicka-Maimone, Blunt tried on a pair of vintage, wide-leg pants that set the tone for the look they were trying to create. \u201cWe almost just built the quirkiness of her around that first pair of pants that I tried on,\u201d explains Blunt. \u201cThen everything else I would imagine she would have found in a thrift store, a secondhand store, or something her mother might\u2019ve made. I think just to create that mismatched, bohemian quality in her was the key.\u201d", "Photo: Renato Campora", "For the movie\u2019s virtual press tour, though, Blunt chose a romantic wardrobe full of color and texture, with help from some of Blunt\u2019s closest friends. Stylist Jessica Paster, who has been working with the actress for more than a decade, makeup artist Jenn Streicher, and hairstylist Renato Campora came together for a week\u2019s worth of interviews and outfits, setting up shop in the TriBeCa office of Blunt\u2019s husband, actor-director John Krasinski. The process was surprisingly laid back. \u201cI was around people that I\u2019m incredibly comfortable with. It was just us in a spacious office, so everyone felt safe [and] we\u2019d all been tested beforehand, so you didn\u2019t have any of that uncertainty health-wise,\u201d Blunt explains. \u201cWe had a blast just playing records and laughing.\u201d Cycling through video conference meetings and FaceTime calls is very 2020, but Blunt admits to missing a few old media promotion staples. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m sad not to do in person are the talk shows,\u201d she says of the conversations with television\u2019s most engaging interviewers. \u201cAnything like Good Morning America or one of the late-night shows\u2014they\u2019re always fun, and I enjoy that part of it.\u201d", "The unspoken dress codes associated with daytime and nightly television also provide structure to any wardrobe choices. After all, what works at 7 a.m. isn\u2019t always the same as what seems stylish after hours. Blunt and Paster kept that idea in mind as they sought out looks to suit each situation. \u201cWhat [Jessica] does is she brings in all of the racks\u2014they\u2019re countless. You should see the amount of clothes she comes in with just for one event,\u201d says Blunt. \u201c[Afterward] I\u2019ll do a small first pull. We go through each look and as soon as I see it, I either go, yup, or no, as it passes by.\u201d Though she selects outfits based on \u2018gut instinct,\u2019 Blunt occasionally needs convincing when it comes to outr\u00e9 runway pieces. \u201cOver the years, Jessica has encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and see style as a way of expressing your artistic sensibilities,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019ll back me up with the more ambitious looks [or] push me when I need a nudge in the right direction. Jessica is just the most generous, kind-hearted person I\u2019ve ever met. She loves her job, we love each other, and we make a great team.\u201d", "Photo: Renato Camporo", "Paster also sought to infuse a bit of the film\u2019s mood into their selections. \u201cBecause the movie is set in Ireland and there\u2019s beautiful rolling hills and pastures and wood...I wanted her wardrobe to have that saturation of beautiful colors, and I wanted it to be cozy for winter,\u201d she says. That meant colorful knitwear from St. John, tweed Saint Laurent jumpsuits, and a wealth of texture worked into each outfit. \u201cWith all these looks, I made sure to include sweaters, wools, and a lot of boots,\u201d says Paster. \u201cI used the color mustard quite a bit, and quilted textures because cottage core is a trend for this season, and I wanted Emily to have a romance with clothing as well.\u201d", "Naturally, Blunt connected with each outfit. She and Paster aimed for variety, switching between bright yellow Christine Alcalay pantsuits and ruffled prairie influenced Miu Miu dresses with ease, but the styles were connected by the mood they brought out in their wearer. \u201cSometimes why you like something can be rather abstract; it just appeals to you,\u201d says Blunt. Instantaneous reactions are great, but there is also something to be said about falling in love with a piece after giving it a test drive. \u201cWhen I saw that Celine dress, I thought \u2018oh that\u2019s cute,\u2019 but when I put it on, I understood how beautiful it is,\u201d says Blunt of the Hedi Slimane-designed number she wore for her first interview of the tour. \u201cYou appreciate the way a designer cuts the dress. It\u2019s so different putting clothes on your body versus seeing them on the hanger; it can turn it into something much more magical than you\u2019d realized.\u201d", "Though the star doesn\u2019t play favorites, there were a few looks that she found incredibly chic. \u201cThe St. John was so gorgeous to me; when I put that on, I was like, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most beautiful outfits ever,\u201d says Blunt. \u201cThe color combination was so unique, and yet the shades worked so beautifully together. I loved the Brandon Maxwell brown tweed dress with that high collar too. I think Jessica called it \u2018farmer glam.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No farmer would be wearing this on a farm, Jessica!\u2019\u201d", "No press tour is complete without a few glamorous moments, though. \u201cI always knew when I had something on that worked because when I came upstairs, everyone in the room went, \u2018wow,\u2019\u201d says Blunt of the silver Saint Laurent jumpsuits that brought everyone to a standstill. A ruffled metallic look from Alexander McQueen's pre-fall 2020 collection had a similarly showstopping effect. \u201cI always love what Sarah Burton does and I just adore her as a person,\" says Blunt. \u201cShe's just such a cool lady. I just loved the essence of that silver dress for this time of year. It was whimsical and Christmas-y it made me happy when I put it on and felt lighter than air.\u201d", "Though she\u2019s capable of making a team of fashion veterans gasp when she walks into a room, the down-to-earth actress admits that despite decades of experience posing for the world\u2019s best photographers and walking the most prominent red carpets, she\u2019s still a casual girl at heart. \u201cI\u2019ve started to embrace fashion as a way that I can dissociate myself from the jeans and sweatpants I normally walk around in,\u201d Blunt says. \u201cWhen I do press or a red carpet, it can be a bit of a spectacle for me, and I dig that.\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["john", "paster", "blunt", "emily", "thyme", "tour", "dress", "renato", "looks", "jessica", "clothes", "press", "bit", "wild", "wardrobe", "mountain", "virtual", "romantic"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
