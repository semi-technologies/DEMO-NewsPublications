Six months? One year? Try one day. Undergarments are a glaring pain point in the sustainable fashion conversation. There are brands making organic cotton and bamboo briefs, but no matter what your undies are made of, they\u2019re still what you might call \u201csingle use.\u201d Underwear is the only thing we can\u2019t donate or sell to a consignment site, so when we\u2019ve worn them out, we have little choice but to throw them in the trash.", "Eleanor Turner, a designer who has worked for Tory Burch, J.Crew, and, most recently, the suiting label Argent (she co-founded the brand in 2016 and departed last year) just launched a timely solution: The Big Favorite, a line of pima cotton underwear and T-shirts designed to be worn, sent back to the brand, and recycled into new garments. In other words, it\u2019s real circularity. Many brands have started using that buzzy term to describe clothes made of recycled content, but unless they\u2019re taking responsibility for the full life cycle of those garments\u2014by taking them back, repurposing them, or recycling them\u2014they aren\u2019t actually closing the loop.", "Few brands have done so. There\u2019s Kristy Caylor\u2019s circular basics label, For Days, and Thousand Fell, which makes recyclable vegan sneakers. What they have in common with The Big Favorite is that they\u2019re making \u201chigh-frequency basics\u201d: Underwear, T-shirts, and sneakers are items we tend to wear until it\u2019s time to replace them (and, let\u2019s be honest, sometimes beyond that point). Even if you wanted to recycle sneakers or thongs from another brand, most of the products on today\u2019s market actually can\u2019t be recycled. Sneakers typically have a dozen plastic pieces that can\u2019t be broken apart, and underwear is often made of blended synthetic fibers, which are difficult to break down and spin into new yarns.", "\u201cBrands will try to approach circularity as an afterthought, but that\u2019s inauthentic,\u201d Turner explains. \u201cIt has to be part of your approach from the very beginning. Our products were specifically designed for their \u2018end of life\u2019\u2014they\u2019re engineered to come apart easily, and we chose pima cotton because it\u2019s a longer-staple fiber that\u2019s better able to be recycled. We\u2019re making those considerations, and that\u2019s where the rubber meets the road,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s where good design and prioritizing the planet meet. That\u2019s where I see the opportunity\u2014by building this brand, we\u2019re also building the experience of taking back garments, and changing people\u2019s behavior with it.\u201d"], "authors": ["Emily Farra", "Emily Farr"], "keywords": ["taking", "favorite", "making", "underwear", "joins", "circular", "cotton", "thats", "cant", "big", "theyre", "movement", "sneakers", "recyclable", "returnable", "recycled", "brand"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
