It will be a gift to the virus, because a crowded Christmas dinner table is the ideal condition for transmission, but if anyone were to fall ill it would be just about the worst present we could give to each other.", "\u201cFor a few exceptional cases it will make sense to meet up \u2013 if you have a relative with limited life expectancy or suffering severe mental health problems from isolation. But they will be exceptional. And if everybody takes advantage of the flexibility then infections will surge and there will be mourning in January.\u201d", "Reicher suggested the government should learn from Zoom\u2019s offer and work with other companies to provide more free options to replace in-person socialising.", "\u201cThey could ask various sectors (especially those that have done well in the pandemic) to help out in a whole series of ways \u2013 say give the latest games to young people asked to self-isolate. The problem then \u2013 and I speak as the father of a 16-year-old \u2013 would be ever to get them out of their rooms rather than trying to keep them in. Or, say, free connection over Christmas so everyone can keep in touch as much as they like without data limits.\u201d", "Susan Michie, the director of the UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, echoed Reicher\u2019s calls for other help. \u201cWe need to remember that many households do not have access to the internet or do not have digital equipment that would allow them to make use of this,\u201d she said.", "Michie, who is a member of both Sage and Independent Sage, added that the latter group had \u201ccalled for all households with children to be provided with laptops or tablets connected to the internet, to mitigate the disparities in education caused by last year\u2019s disruption to education.\u201d", "Zoom is not the only option for a socially distanced Christmas. Google Meet is free for all users until 31 March, and a number of other services including Facebook Messenger, Apple\u2019s FaceTime and Epic\u2019s Houseparty have always been free for all users."], "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "keywords": ["limits", "say", "meet", "accounts", "lifts", "40minute", "zoom", "limit", "users", "help", "sage", "free", "christmas", "socially"], "pubDate": "2020-12-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
