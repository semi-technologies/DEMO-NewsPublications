The calendar is a way for me to archive and catalogue all of the pieces that have been through my hands.\u201d This year, with the pandemic and quarantine, she had an even bigger abundance of pieces that were begging to be worn\u2014so she channelled her creativity into a 2021 calendar shoot, which was shot at a secret hotel in Palm Springs this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s this \u201970s motel, and they have all these crazy themed rooms,\u201d says Chachki. \u201cThe rooms and spaces dictated each month.\u201d", "Each calendar month saw Chachki embrace its feeling or mood. She got spooky for Halloween, or romantic and flirty for February\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day theme. (December, however, proved to be not very Christmas-like, instead, it\u2019s more ballerina-inspired. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m kind of a Grinch,\u201d she says.) For Chachki\u2019s birth month in June, she also went for a Barbarella-inspired look, a favorite film of hers. \u201cIt\u2019s super surreal and campy,\u201d she says. \u201cI love that retro-futuristic look, because it feels modern in a way. I had this reflective mylar corset and panty made by my corset maker in Atlanta, who I call my own personal Mr Pearl.\u201d"], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["feast", "violet", "chachkis", "month", "glamorous", "stuff", "pieces", "calendar", "rooms", "way", "visual", "im", "corset", "chachki", "look", "2021"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
