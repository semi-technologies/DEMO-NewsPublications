Ha! Bet you\u2019re not as bad as me.", "For years this rarely bothered me but, like so many of us in the first lockdown, I gloried in previously familiar green city spaces, and longed to record the joy they brought. A quick snap on my phone \u2013 destined to join hundreds not looked at again \u2013 never quite captured the moment. So I was intrigued to see that Walthamstow-based artist Sharon Drew was running \u201cgreen sketching\u201d sessions in Epping Forest, on the edge of north London, near her home and mine.", "This seemed a perfect Covid-safe activity \u2013 held outdoors, groups limited to five plus Sharon \u2013 and were also perfect, she assured me, for the untalented. And even pouring rain wouldn\u2019t ruin them, because we could use watercolour pencils, which are \u201cdesigned to work with water\u201d.", "(I joined a session at the very beginning of November \u2013 before new restrictions obliged Sharon to cancel dates later in the month \u2013 but lockdown would seem to offer space and time to go to a green space alone or with family for a spot of doodling.)", "My daughter, Laura, agreed to come along to offer moral support, so as I tried to quash long-held feelings of inadequacy, we grabbed waterproofs and headed for a clearing in the south of the forest called Gilbert\u2019s Slade.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The sessions are run by artist Sharon Drew. Photograph: Harriet MacSween", "Our group were all women, a couple with some artistic training, most carrying bars of chocolate and flasks of coffee, as well as paper and pencils. Sharon gave us newbies boards, clips, watercolour pencils and slim sticks of charcoal, then set us all going on exercises to waken the creative brain: doodling randomly with a pencil in each hand, then trying to draw fallen leaves with our non-dominant hand. Strangely, my left-handed leaves gave me more confidence, not less.", "What I needed was to just get over myself, and I\u2019d been helped in this by looking into the origins of \u201cgreen sketching\u201d. Sharon has used the forest for inspiration in her painting for decades, but got the idea for spreading the word about it to non-artists from an environmental scientist.", "Dr Ali Foxon was in Switzerland working with climate experts on a report about greenhouse gas emissions when she had an epiphany: yet another wordy, evidence-based document was not going to make one jot of difference to public behaviour and attitudes. What Ali found more worthwhile was sketching: a 10-minute doodle of trees, birds or flowers \u2013 while her baby slept in his pram \u2013 made her see natural beauty and filled her with delight. Spreading this joy could be the key, she thought, to making people care about nature.", "Great \u2013 but the point that hit home with me was that according to her, the quality of the sketch is irrelevant. It\u2019s the process of drawing, not the look of the finished product, that matters.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The writer captures the forest around her. Photograph: Harriet MacSween", "Ali launched her movement, Boggy Doodles, in 2016, with information, blog and courses (mostly cancelled this year, sadly). Sharon discovered it recently and says it \u201ctotally resonated\u201d with her own approach. \u201cAnd with the majestic Epping Forest in full autumn splendour on my doorstep, everything fell into place.\u201d", "The day we were there the forest was glorious \u2013 all gold, copper and bronze \u2013 and mercifully it was dry, mild and reasonably still, which meant we could set to sketching tree bark and fallen logs with charcoal. The little black sticks are a reassuringly forgiving medium \u2013 blunders can be erased, covered up or muddled into something else \u2013 but charcoal easily gets washed away in heavy rain.", "We spent the last hour trying to capture a forest scene. Sharon suggested picking three trees and drawing them in relation to each other and their backgrounds.", "I settled on a couple of oaks and a hornbeam \u2013 my favourite tree, for its elegant fluted bark and the crazy angles it can grow at. Hoping not to embarrass myself too much, I made a real effort to catch the dark and brighter areas of the trunks, their textures, and the light feathery bracken and darker holly around them. I surprised myself with the idea of using an eraser to create the white shape of a silver birch in the middle distance.", "Mine looked more like a winter scene \u2013 I hadn\u2019t managed to capture the fuzz of autumn leaves as well as the interlaced twigs and branches. But when the five of us brought our work together at the end, I wasn\u2019t too ashamed: mine was the clumsiest, but not egregiously so.", "I had relished this chance for a real and physical creative experience \u2013 I can\u2019t be the only one to feel bleak at the prospect of a new round of Zoom quiz nights and video drinks. Sharon talked about how it\u2019s not always easy to work outdoors \u2013 with walkers passing and excited dogs running about \u2013 but I\u2019d been so much \u201cin the zone\u201d I wasn\u2019t aware of any of that.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The group\u2019s finished work, the writer\u2019s drawing is in the middle row on the left. Photograph: Liz Boulter", "Ali Foxon quotes research showing how sketching calms a busy, anxious mind \u2013 it worked with me \u2013 and that training the brain to notice \u201clittle things\u201d that spark joy boosts resilience to life\u2019s challenges.", "While engaging with nature may well make us more keen on protecting it \u2013 in Robert Macfarlane\u2019s words, \u201cWe will not save what we do not love \u2013 and we rarely love what we cannot name or do not see\u201d \u2013 the benefits of sketching work the other way, too. After all, most of are going to have sore need of sources of calmness and resilience over the coming winter.", "\u2022 Green sketching sessions with Sharon Drew cost \u00a330pp including materials.
