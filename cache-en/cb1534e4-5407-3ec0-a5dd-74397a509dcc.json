It was amassed mostly from trips to the American Museum of Natural History gift shop, or just digging around in my grandparents\u2019 backyard. It grew to 62 specimens according to an elementary school journal, and featured the likes of pyrite, marble, limestone, and pumice. I wasn\u2019t under the impression these rocks held any metaphysical powers, I just thought they were cool. That the same dirt could produce so many different objects, alternately glittering or sleek or waxy or colorful, seemed like magic enough.", "But according to some, I was collecting powerful tools\u2014pyrite to combat impostor syndrome and marble to lure stability and rational thinking.

St. Hildegard von Bingen wrote in the 12th century that spitting on an amethyst and rubbing it on your face would get rid of unwanted spots, and that drinking pearl-infused water would cure headaches. In Twelfth Night, Shakespeare referenced the common association of opals with fickleness. According to the Feng Shui tradition, a properly placed amethyst can bring luck in business.", "Today, the casual power of the crystal has been co-opted by capitalism, wellness, and whiteness. The pressure is to buy a crystal for every mood (which can quickly add up) so you can have the perfectly Instagrammable altar that representings a perfectly boho-chic lifestyle. Crystals are advertised as vague tools for self-optimization. You are supposed to get rid of that negative energy, to communicate better so you can work better.
