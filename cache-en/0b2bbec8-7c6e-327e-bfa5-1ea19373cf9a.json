She opted for pieces fresh from the Fall 2020 runway, including a sleek pinstriped blazer and a pair of incredibly tailored jeans. For a little skin, she donned a polka dot top that buttoned at the collar and let a sliver of d\u00e9colletag\u00e9 come through. This isn\u2019t the first time that Pfeiffer has had a standout fashion moment for her press tour. Back in early October, she wore an equally French outfit by Yves Saint Laurent, which included a knit red blouse, a burgundy blazer, and a pair of jeans.", "Celine Fall 2020 Photo: Alessandro Lucioni / Gorunway.com", "There has always been debate around what \u201cFrench style\u201d really entails, especially after Netflix\u2019s Emily in Paris and the titular character\u2019s divisive wardrobe. But we can agree that Pfeiffer nails the concept. The secret here? Pfeiffer wears a pair of jeans with an elevated top. It\u2019s a tried-and-true French wardrobe trick, employed by Parisian icons Jane Birkin and Caroline de Maigret, as well as former Vogue stylist Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele. Who can forget when de Dudzeele put model Michaela Bercu in a bedazzled Christian Lacroix sweater and a pair of Guess jeans for Anna Wintour\u2019s first issue of Vogue back in 1988?
