Her lungs collapsed, or partially collapsed, on five occasions, as she struggled to survive what the coroner heard was a form of asthma that flooded her lungs with fluid.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kissi-Debrah has launched a charity in Ella\u2019s name to improve the lives of children with asthma in south-east London. Photograph: Claire Cox/PA", "It was Holgate\u2019s examination of these years, recorded in medical notes from a range of experts whom Kissi-Debrah turned to for help, that led to a pattern emerging.", "Unlike most people with asthma, Ella\u2019s attacks were not triggered by pollen or respiratory infections but something else. Holgate\u2019s work exposed that pattern as a seasonal one: it was in winter when air pollution levels spiked that Ella was brought down with coughing fits, which triggered secretions in her lungs that in turn triggered her collapses.", "Ella and her family lived just 25 metres from South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London, where levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution from traffic constantly exceeded the annual legal limit of 40\u00b5g/m3 between 2006 and 2010.", "The scale of the crisis was a public health emergency, the hearing was told, and the efforts of the authorities to tackle it were glacial.", "But as she walked to school along the main road and sometimes the back streets, Ella and her mother were in ignorance of the damage the toxic air was causing. No one had told them.", "Kissi-Debrah said she knew almost nothing about air pollution or nitrogen dioxide while her daughter was alive. \u201cI knew about car fumes, the phrase, but nothing else.\u201d", "The first inquest into her daughter\u2019s death in 2014 recorded that Ella had died in Februrary 2013 of acute respiratory failure. There was no mention of any environmental factors causing the fatal collapse.", "It was only when Kissi-Debrah launched a charity in her daughter\u2019s name to improve the lives of children with asthma in south-east London that she started to make connections.", "\u201cI got a call from someone who told me [that] in the two days around Ella\u2019s death there were big spikes in air pollution locally,\u201d Kissi-Debrah said. From there the evidence grew, and the case was taken up by the human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The first inquest into Ella\u2019s death recorded that she had died of acute respiratory failure. Photograph: Rosamund Kissi-Debrah/PA", "When Holgate produced a report for the family last year linking air pollution levels to Ella\u2019s death, the attorney general quashed the first inquest.", "Over the past two weeks a very different inquiry into what took the nine-year-old\u2019s life has been played out in the coroner\u2019s court.", "This time government departments, officials from the local authority and the mayor of London were questioned about what they did \u2013 or did not do \u2013 to reduce illegal air pollution levels around the area Ella lived.", "Crucially, they were interrogated about whether they informed the public of the risk to their lives from the air they were breathing, and whether their failings might have breached Ella\u2019s right to life.", "In heartrending evidence, Kissi-Debrah, a former teacher, told the coroner that had she known the air her daughter was breathing was killing her, she would have moved house immediately.", "\u201cWe were desperate for anything to help her. I would have moved straight away, I would have found another hospital for her and moved. I cannot say it enough. I was desperate, she was desperate,\u201d she said.", "The impact of leaving the toxic surroundings could have led to a different outcome for Ella, Holgate told the hearing.", "He referred to a case in France last year, where a mother successfully sued the French state over the impact of living near Paris\u2019s traffic-choked ringroad in Saint-Ouen. The mother and daughter moved to Orl\u00e9ans on doctors\u2019 advice and their health improved considerably.", "For Ella, that did not happen. But the finding this week by a London coroner that air pollution was to blame for her death, after her mother\u2019s long fight for the truth may help to prevent other children in her daughter\u2019s situation from suffering as she did."], "authors": ["Sandra Laville"], "keywords": ["told", "deaths", "kissidebrah", "ellas", "ella", "fight", "air", "prevent", "pollution", "mother", "mothers", "help", "justice", "death", "london", "asthma"], "pubDate": "2020-12-16T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
