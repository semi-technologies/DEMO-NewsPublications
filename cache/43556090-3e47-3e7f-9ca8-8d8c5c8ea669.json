What are they going to do on Wednesdays without us?\u201d", "Helen Jones\u2014a Black woman, whose son, John Horton, died in the custody of the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department, in 2009\u2014and Baba Akili, a veteran organizer and Black Lives Matter leader, stood outside the Hall of Justice, in downtown Los Angeles. They have been there every Wednesday for three years, protesting, along with other activists and families of people killed by the police at grocery stores; in malls; on bicycles; while in the midst of mental-health crises. To the protesters, the building is the Hall of Injustice: the headquarters of the sheriff\u2019s department, which is responsible for many of those deaths, and the office of District Attorney Jackie Lacey, who has been cautious about charging law-enforcement officers. The day after the election, the street was the site of celebration. Lacey had been voted out.", "\u201cDay One, she\u2019s been in bed with law enforcement,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe thought, She\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s a mother. She\u2019s a Black woman. She understands our plight. Who knows better than her? It was exactly the opposite.\u201d Lacey, who opposed numerous pieces of criminal-justice-reform legislation and sent twenty-two people of color to death row, reportedly raised seven million dollars, mostly from police and deputy unions. Her opponent, George Gasc\u00f3n, who is Cuban-American and a former L.A.P.D. officer\u2014he also served as police chief in San Francisco and, later, as the city\u2019s D.A.\u2014ran on a platform of decarceration and decreasing police funding. He outraised Lacey nearly two to one.", "Dr. Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter L.A., arrived, in a B.L.M. T-shirt and beaded cowrie-shell earrings. What looked like military planes passed overhead; L.A.P.D. and sheriff\u2019s-department helicopters buzzed back and forth; the streets were blocked by parked police S.U.V.s, lights flashing. Abdullah looked serene. \u201cWe have been demanding for years that Jackie Lacey be accountable to the constituency that elected her, especially Black folks,\u201d she said. \u201cShe continues to run and duck and hide and refuses to meet with us.\u201d Right before the primary, Abdullah led a bus full of protesters to Lacey\u2019s house. \u201cWe headed out to the deep valley, where she lives, and set up chairs on the public sidewalk in front of her house. We prayed, we poured libations, we did a land acknowledgment, and then we walked to her front door and invited her to join us.\u201d When the door opened, Abdullah said, it was Lacey\u2019s husband, a retired investigative auditor for the District Attorney\u2019s office, pointing a gun at her chest. \u201cHe says, \u2018I will shoot you, I don\u2019t care who you are.\u2019 He had his finger on the trigger.\u201d (In August, the state attorney general\u2019s office filed assault charges against Lacey\u2019s husband, to which he pleaded not guilty, and Abdullah recently filed a civil claim.)", "\u201cI thought working from Hell would be temporary.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by P. C. Vey", "Los Angeles is the most populous county in the country; the city of L.A. is among the world\u2019s largest jailers. A progressive district attorney would be a triumph for the criminal-justice-reform movement. The crowd was giddy with victory. \u201cBye,\u201d one protester had written, in eyeliner, underneath one eye. \u201cByeee Jackie\u201d read a banner stretched between two protesters. On the flatbed stage of the organizers\u2019 truck, \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d played from a set of speakers. Next to the speakers was a suitcase with a sign on it saying \u201cPack Your Shit Up Bitch.\u201d A security announcement: Avoid \u201cundisciplined factions that have come to disrupt.\u201d And be aware of undercover cops in the crowd.", "Akili pointed out a parked police van. \u201cI have never seen them that close,\u201d he said. He is seventy-two, was wearing a \u201c#byeJackie2020\u201d T-shirt, and had a glitter tattoo of a black-and-gold fist on his arm. He recalled, as a child, hearing his parents talk about the murder of Emmett Till. He was happy about Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s win, but wary. \u201cWe have no illusions,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is in an institution that is set up, designed, and implemented to punish, and in America if you set up an institution like that it will always punish Black people more and more severely.\u201d He went on, \u201cThere\u2019s been at least nine murders, mostly by the sheriffs, since George Floyd. Control the threat and suppress the danger, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trained to do. We are seen as a threat and a danger. The difference now is at least whoever occupies that office knows that we are going to be expecting some accountability.\u201d", "On the other side of the Hall of Justice, the sheriff\u2019s department had amassed a huge concentration of trucks and deputies in riot gear. They said they were there to protect the building. A legal observer in a neon-green hat and a face mask approached with a notebook, asking questions. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you!\u201d one deputy shouted three times, until he went away. More legal observers gathered on a street corner, watching as people joined the event. Two beefy men with buzz cuts approached purposefully. \u201cHere come some more undercovers,\u201d one of the observers said. \u201cYou can tell by the body language, build, their whole demeanor.\u201d A reporter tried to follow them, but, conspicuous as they had seemed a moment before, they disappeared into the crowd. \u2666"], "authors": ["Dana Goodyear", "Dana Goodyea"], "keywords": ["protesters", "woman", "activists", "set", "lacey", "abdullah", "da", "la", "black", "sheriffs", "welcome", "protests", "office", "shes", "lives"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
