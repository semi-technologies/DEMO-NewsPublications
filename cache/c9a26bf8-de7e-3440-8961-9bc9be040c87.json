The truism in Hollywood has long been that, although a man could emerge into the klieg lights at almost any age, a screen actress who didn\u2019t break through by her mid-30s had lost her chance. For Colman, life as a true movie star didn\u2019t begin until after 40; her coronation holds the promise of a slow, thrilling transformation in the industry. \u201cDefinitely, roles are getting more interesting, complicated, and textured,\u201d says Weisz, who, like Colman, has been shining brightest in her 40s. \u201cBut women in their 40s are interesting.\u201d Over breakfast, keeping one eye on the clock because the second of her three children has an early dismissal from school, Colman tells me that she doesn\u2019t think she could have made it big as a young actress, nor would she have wanted to. \u201cTo be the ingenue and to keep working is rare because once people see you as that, they don\u2019t like the process of aging,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhich is fucking ridiculous!\u201d She meets my eyes. \u201cI grew to my place.\u201d", "It is customary for Vogue to choose its cover stars from emerging young talent and soaring celebrity leaders. At 45, Colman is a cover woman for a new era: proof of the glamour of slowly and devotedly building one\u2019s life and craft; a reminder that, for a rising generation of powerful women, it is possible to reach success and mastery while remaining honest, patient, healthy, whole. \u201cEveryone shines a little more when she is acting with them,\u201d says Waller-Bridge. \u201cI will always aspire to her level of brilliance, but I\u2019ve been equally inspired by who she is as a person and a professional. Work hard, and be nice to people. And don\u2019t take yourself too seriously. And karaoke. I say those are the secrets to being as close to Olivia Colman as possible. Oh\u2014and be hysterically funny and a genre-defying acting genius.\u201d", "COLMAN LIVES IN SOUTH LONDON, in a timeworn, light-filled house that she and Sinclair purchased seven years ago. It is nested in a quiet neighborhood, leafy but not precious, with parks not far away. On summer weekends, neighbors work in their front yards, tending rosebushes and lavender. When I show up, it is the day after the solstice\u2014one of the bright summer Saturdays in London that begin with trees catching the early--morning winds and end with a long, wild, luminous-blue gloaming sky. Sinclair, a silver-haired man with a trim beard, is dressed in cargo shorts and a daddish button-down shirt, untucked; Colman wears a casual charcoal-gray dress. I get on my knees to greet the dogs: Pockets, a Kokoni mix rescued from Cyprus (who leaps to lick my face), and her senior, Alfred, Lord Waggyson, a magisterial terrier-poodle. Sinclair is gathering children out the door, bound for the market.", "\u201cEggs?\u201d he calls.", "\u201cI think we have enough,\u201d Colman says, gazing into the refrigerator.", "\u201cSugar?\u201d", "The goods are for a barbecue that they are hosting that evening.
