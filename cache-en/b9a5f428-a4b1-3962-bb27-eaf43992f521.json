Microsoft\u2019s Teams platform has also been a formidable challenger to Slack. Shares in Slack have performed poorly compared with other providers of remote tech. See article.", "What looms for Zoom?", "Zoom, one of the chief beneficiaries from the turn to remote working, reported that revenue soared by 367% in its latest quarter, year on year, to $777m. But its share price took another knock, as the news on vaccines and the prospect of a return to office normality raised more questions about its future.", "There was more consolidation in the data-provision industry, as S&P Global , best known for compiling credit ratings, struck a deal to acquire IHS Markit, an American-British information provider. At $44bn, it is the largest takeover in America this year. See article.", "Airbnb said it would price its forthcoming IPO at between $44 and $50 a share, which would value it at up to $35bn. That is double a private estimate from earlier this year, when the home-rental firm was hit by lockdowns. It has since bounced back, as people seek remote dwellings either to work in or to get away from it all. The pandemic \u201chas accelerated the ability to live anywhere\u201d Airbnb recently said.", "China followed through with its threat to impose tariffs of between 107% and 212% on Australian wine imports. China is the biggest market for Aussie wineries. Beijing says the tariffs are an anti-dumping measure to stop Australian imports damaging the domestic wine industry, but it has slapped tariffs on other Australian goods this year, as the countries\u2019 diplomatic relations have worsened.", "The government might be about to change in Washington, DC , but a new law that may in effect ban trading in shares of Chinese companies on American stock exchanges over concerns about their accounting practices is very close to becoming reality.

However, with exports falling, a widening current-account deficit could spell more trouble for the lira.", "India\u2019s economy is still struggling, contractingby 7.5% in the three months ending September, year on year. Still, that was an improvement on the previous quarter, when GDP shrank by 24%. See article. The OECD \u2019s latest outlook forecast that global GDP will return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year, if outbreaks of covid-19 are under control and vaccines are widely available. It forecasts the world economy will grow by around 4% in both 2021 and 2022. The recovery will be uneven, however. China and other non- OECD countries will chalk up faster growth rates than developed ones. In Britain, the pandemic pushed more long-struggling retailers to the wall. Arcadia, which owns a string of high-street clothing brands, such as Topshop and Burton, fell into administration.
