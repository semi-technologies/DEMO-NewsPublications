We hit all the metrics.\u201d", "The ValleyCats were a short-season affiliate of the Houston Astros for 18 seasons, winning three league championships and drawing more than 4,000 fans per game for 11 straight seasons from 2008-18.", "In their most recent season, Tri-City had the third-highest attendance in the 14-team league, averaging more than 3,869. The only two teams that were higher, Brooklyn and Hudson Valley, both survived with moves to a new league.", "\u201cYou look at the facility, the attendance, you look at the fan base, you look at the geography,\u201d Murphy said, pointing to a metropolitan area of more than 1.1 million residents that includes the nearby cities of Albany and Schenectady. \"You look at the market size and what we\u2019ve been able to do for the last 18 years, and you would think it would have put us in a good position to be part of the 120.\u201d", "Tri-City wasn't the only team that had cause to gripe.", "The Lexington Legends, long one of the better-drawing clubs in the Class A South Atlantic League, were cast aside in the contraction.", "Ditto for the Kane County Cougars, a Class A Midwest League team based in the Chicago suburbs for nearly three decades. Despite ranking in the top three in attendance every year but one over their long history, the Cougars didn't get the call from the big leagues.", "Now, they'll have to carry on as an independent franchise in one of the \u201caffiliated leagues\u201d that MLB is partnering with to supposedly help find landing spots for at least some of the spurned teams.", "The American Association or the Frontier League seem the most likely destination for a relaunch that the team's owners bravely called \u201cKane County Cougars 2.0.\u201d", "\u201cAt this point, we\u2019re not sure where we\u2019re going to end up,\u201d Curtis Haug, the Cougars' vice president and general manager, told the Chicago Tribune. \u201cThe baseball landscape has changed quite a bit.\u201d", "Even some of the teams that survived the purge got the short end of the bat.", "Take the Wichita Wind Surge, a team that has yet to play its first game. Formerly the New Orleans Baby Cakes of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, the team was lured to Kansas by the promise of a $75 million, 10,025-seat stadium.", "Well, the stadium was built, but the team couldn't play in 2020 because MLB shut down the minor leagues in the midst of the pandemic.", "Now, while still waiting to take the field in their new home, they have been demoted to the Double-A Texas League as part of a reorganization that MLB also imposed to enhance regionalization between big league clubs and their affiliates.", "Not surprisingly, getting sent down without ever playing a game in Triple-A did not go over well with some Wichita fans.", "\u201cI know there are people who had their hopes set on Triple-A,\u201d Mayor Brandon Whipple told The Wichita Eagle, though he insisted there wouldn't be much of a difference.", "\u201cIt all comes down to fan experience,\" he said. \u201cAnd we have one of the best stadiums in minor league baseball and our fan experience will be second to none.\u201d", "The Fresno Grizzlies took an even greater fall than the Wind Surge.", "MLB essentially gave the team an ultimatum: Agree to shift from the Triple-A PCL to the California League \u2014 which will be at the lowest level of the new four-class alignment \u2014 or be dumped from affiliated baseball altogether.", "With few other options, the city signed off on a deal late Thursday to allow the Grizzlies to drop down.
