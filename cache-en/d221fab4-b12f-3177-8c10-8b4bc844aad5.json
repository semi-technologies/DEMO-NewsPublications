Plus, Julie\u2019s and my relationship at that point was not in the best place.\u201d By 1991, they had separated. \u201cI was struggling with some personal stuff, psychological stuff, and Julie, what with the child and the movie, couldn\u2019t help me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just very immature.\u201d He also said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to become Mr. Dash.\u201d", "Talking on Skype, as Jafa and I were obliged to do because of the pandemic, has unexpected limitations. I was on the East Coast, and Jafa was in Los Angeles, and it took me three sessions to realize that Jafa\u2019s brother Boston was sitting across the desk from him, working quietly while we talked. I finally \u201cmet\u201d him when he got up and walked into view and waved. The brothers don\u2019t look alike, but they sound very much like brothers, with Deep South accents. A.J., who is interested in clothes and gets invited to openings at Gucci, wears a small diamond stud on his right eyebrow, and another one just under his lower lip. \u201cI\u2019ve had the studs for more than twenty years,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople used to think the one below my lip was a crumb\u2014before Covid, they\u2019d try to brush it off.\u201d", "Jafa usually sat with his back to a window, so on bright days he was in shadow, and only gradually did I become aware of his tattoos. They were more or less everywhere: a black panther on his neck; a drawing of an early work by Zaha Hadid, \u201cThe Peak,\u201d which was never built, on his left arm; \u201cFRODO,\u201d from \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d in capital letters and also on his left arm; Krazy Kat on the back of one hand. There were a lot more of them, he said, and a story to go with each. So, Krazy Kat? \u201cPeople have pointed out to me that it\u2019s ironic, because I don\u2019t like cats,\u201d Jafa said. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect your personal space. But Krazy Kat at one point was the biggest thing in American popular culture, and the artist who drew him, George Herriman, is such an interesting figure to me\u2014his own kids never knew their father was Black.\u201d", "When Jafa tells stories, the words come slowly at first, in a baritone drawl, but as he gets going the pitch rises and the tempo accelerates. \u201cThe cat loves the mouse, the mouse hates the cat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dog, Officer Pupp, loves the cat, but the cat can\u2019t see him because the cat loves the mouse. And what makes it worse is that the mouse keeps throwing a brick at Krazy Kat\u2019s head, which is an act of violence, but the cat sees the violence as an act of love, and so the circle continues. The absurdity of it strikes me as being as good a model of Black love and hate in white society as we\u2019ve ever seen, a profound and absurd meditation on the thin line between love and hate.\u201d", "Jafa was born in 1960 in Tupelo, Mississippi, the birthplace of Elvis Presley. \u201cMy mom was born in Tupelo, and so were my aunt and uncle, and my grandparents grew up there,\u201d Jafa told me. His aunt Nettie has served on the Tupelo City Council since 2001. Jafa\u2019s full name is Arthur Jafa Fielder; he dropped Fielder (as his grandfather, another Arthur Jafa, had done) when he was in his early twenties, but his family ties have never weakened. Arthur and Rowena, his parents, were teachers, and his siblings\u2014three younger brothers\u2014have all found arts-related careers: Boston, the second oldest, is a musician and a filmmaker. (Named for their father\u2019s cousin, Ralph Boston, he was called Ralph until he got to high school, where everyone started calling him Boston.) Jim teaches film production in New York City high schools, and his twin brother, Tim, writes graphic novels.", "A still from Jafa\u2019s film \u201cLove Is the Message, the Message Is Death.\u201d \u201cIt was a response to the influx of footage of Black people being assaulted, which I had just been throwing in a file,\u201d Jafa says. Art work courtesy the artist and Gladstone Gallery", "Jafa\u2019s school integrated the year he entered first grade, and he was one of a handful of African-Americans in his class. Two years earlier, the family had moved to Russellville, Alabama, but Jafa was sent back to Tupelo to live with his grandparents so that he could go to school there. When the Ku Klux Klan burned down their house in Russellville (Arthur had been named football coach of the recently combined white and Black high schools), they returned to Tupelo. The whole family moved again, less than a year later, to Clarksdale, Mississippi, where Arthur and Rowena had been offered positions at Coahoma Junior College, an innovative school for Black students. Arthur taught physical education and coached football and basketball; Rowena, who taught business administration, became the school\u2019s financial director.", "Clarksdale is in the Mississippi Delta, which Jafa describes as a Black Jurassic Park. \u201cI grew up in a region where some of the more horrific acts in the century occurred,\u201d Jafa said. \u201cEmmett Till was killed, the three civil-rights workers were killed, people were tortured and murdered and nobody was brought to trial.\u201d Unlike Tupelo, Clarksdale had held on to hard-core segregation long after it became illegal. And yet, growing up in a supportive family and on a college campus, the Fielder children felt protected and encouraged. For the first few years, the family lived on the campus in a blue-and-white trailer with three bedrooms. \u201cArt and I shared a room,\u201d Boston recalled. \u201cIt was filled with Marvel and DC comic books, and boxes of the magazines that Art cut pictures out of and pasted in notebooks. He slept in the top bunk, and I was on the bottom. We\u2019d tell each other stories and make drawings\u2014he\u2019d draw something and hand it down to me, and I\u2019d hand one up to him.\u201d", "\u201cThe move from Tupelo to Clarksdale was mainly a change in soundtrack,\u201d Jafa said. \u201cIn Tupelo, the radio was dominated by Elvis Presley. I remember my grandmother telling stories about Elvis. They knew him in the Black part of town\u2014that\u2019s how poor he was. When Elvis was a kid, he would sit on the porch of a nearby house and play guitar.\u201d Jafa was never a Presley fan. In Clarksdale, where the soundtrack was Memphis soul, all four Fielder boys went to Catholic school, because their non-Catholic parents thought they would get a better education that way. (Their father eventually converted to Catholicism.) Jafa was an altar boy and a straight-A student, and in high school he became a National Merit Scholar. \u201cI was just elated to know that I had one student, just one, who could have gotten into M.I.T.,\u201d Olenza McBride, his social-studies teacher, recalled.", "Jafa read all the time\u2014first comics, then science fiction, the World Book (his parents bought the series, and later they added the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica), history, sociology, and world literature. \u201cOur neighbor was head librarian at the college,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would let me stay there after hours\u2014I\u2019d fall asleep in the stacks, and my dad would come to pick me up at two in the morning.\u201d Jafa and Boston saw every movie they could get to. One Saturday afternoon, when Jafa was ten, their parents dropped them off at the white people\u2019s theatre on the other side of town to see Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d The theatre was empty except for a few white couples, who left before the intermission. \u201cThe lights go down, the movie begins, and it\u2019s like being buried alive,\u201d Jafa wrote, in a 2015 essay called \u201cMy Black Death.\u201d \u201cEven now, I\u2019m still searching for an art experience capable of matching the effect this film had on me.\u201d When it ended, he and Boston walked out in a daze to the empty lobby, where the white theatre manager sat in the ticket booth reading a newspaper. \u201cAt this point in my life I didn\u2019t have un-chaperoned interactions with white people, young or old,\u201d Jafa wrote. \u201cHe was sitting in the ticket booth with the door open, so I walked over to him and said, \u2018Excuse me, sir, I\u2019ve just come out of the movie, could you tell me what it was about?\u2019 He looked at me over his paper, paused a moment, and said, \u2018Son, I\u2019ve been looking at it all week and I haven\u2019t got a clue.\u2019 \u201d", "There was a coda to the experience. In the mid-nineties, when Jafa was working as a cinematographer, Kubrick hired him to be a second-unit cameraman for \u201cEyes Wide Shut.\u201d Kubrick shot most of the film in England, but it was set in New York, and Jafa spent a lot of time filming locations there. \u201cWe were constantly shooting things over and over, because Kubrick kept sending notes saying would we try it again three degrees to the left, or three degrees to the right,\u201d Jafa recalled. \u201cHe called many times a day, and occasionally the assistant director would say, \u2018Stanley\u2019s on the phone, he wants to say hi,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018Not now, I\u2019m shooting.\u2019 \u201d In 1999, returning from Europe to attend the film\u2019s New York premi\u00e8re, Jafa saw a newspaper headline: \u201cSTANLEY KUBRICK DIES AT 70.\u201d \u201cStanley Kubrick was one of my heroes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was so much I wanted to say to him, and I\u2019d had this fantasy that when we finished shooting we\u2019d be able to have a proper conversation. I went to the premi\u00e8re and got very depressed, trying to figure out why I had never spoken to him.\u201d", "Shooting other people\u2019s films was always, for Jafa, a stepping stone to shooting his own. \u201cI love cinematography, but once I\u2019d mastered the craft it was never fulfilling on its own,\u201d he told me. \u201cDaughters of the Dust\u201d had brought no directing offers, though, and until recently neither Dash nor Jafa could get funding for a second feature. Hollywood producers had financed and profited from nineteen-seventies blaxploitation films, some of which had Black directors, but the first Black filmmaker of Jafa\u2019s generation to break into the Hollywood system and establish a career on his own terms was Spike Lee. Lee went to a screening of \u201cDaughters\u201d and as he was leaving the theatre he introduced himself and asked if Jafa would like to work on a film about Malcolm X. Jafa said yes, and his skill as a cameraman on the movie led to his becoming the cinematographer for Lee\u2019s next feature, \u201cCrooklyn.\u201d \u201cSpike changed my life,\u201d Jafa said. \u201cHe put me on the path to being a legitimate entity in the film universe.\u201d The two of them didn\u2019t get along, though, and they haven\u2019t worked together since. Lee had no interest in Jafa\u2019s urge to experiment on \u201cCrooklyn\u201d with lenses and film speeds, cinematic rhythms, and nonlinear storytelling. \u201cWe had a rocky collaboration, but we\u2019ve finally reached a rapprochement, and I want to keep it that way,\u201d Jafa told me.", "I asked him to name the filmmakers he most admired. \u201cI like films more than filmmakers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, anything Andrei Tarkovsky ever did, especially \u2018The Mirror\u2019 and \u2018The Sacrifice,\u2019 his last. Tarkovsky\u2019s films are philosophical meditations on life, time, aging, things like that.\u201d Yasujir\u014d Ozu, he said, was \u201cright up there, not quite as high as Tarkovsky. Ozu will sit with things.\u201d The Italians? \u201cI love Fellini, Pasolini, Antonioni. Antonioni is a great filmmaker, but to me that really does come down to \u2018L\u2019Avventura,\u2019 the film where he plays with dimensions of dramatic time and space. There\u2019s a scene with Monica Vitti in a hotel corridor. She walks into the frame, and then out of the frame, and in a Hollywood film you would cut, but the camera just stays on that long, empty hallway.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m a huge proponent of control over speed.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Juan Astasio", "Jafa respects Ingmar Bergman, but, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if his films have aged so well, even \u2018Persona,\u2019 which is clearly a great film.\u201d He likes Godard more than Truffaut, and, he said, \u201cBresson is above anybody we\u2019ve mentioned, except Tarkovsky\u2014Bresson is the Beethoven and Bach of cinema.\u201d He also paid homage to Oscar Micheaux, whom he called \u201cthe godfather of Black American cinema.\u201d I asked him about Andy Warhol. \u201cNeck and neck with Bresson,\u201d he said, to my surprise. \u201cEvery moment in a Warhol film is an extended moment. You think of Miles Davis, the speed at which he improvises. His notes sit in the air like they\u2019re unfurling in slow motion. They always feel introspective, considered, not in the moment.\u201d Jafa puts \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d in his top ten films, \u201cbut Coppola is not in my top ten directors.\u201d", "From the early nineties to 2000, living in New York, Jafa shot documentaries (on Audre Lorde and W. E. B. Du Bois, among others), music videos, and television commercials. \u201cThe early nineties was when you started to see more Blacks in Hollywood movies,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to direct music videos, and I was very unsuccessful. I could never crack it. I guess I could have moved to Hollywood and done what everybody else does, but I didn\u2019t see that.\u201d Ideas for films proliferated in his head. The schoolboy notebooks in which he\u2019d pasted images from comic books and magazines when he was ten had been succeeded by three-ring binders filled with movie stills, advertisements, news photographs, and reproductions from art books and countless other sources\u2014images that he liked to show to people. He often had binders with him. \u201cA.J. was always a great storyteller of his own film ideas,\u201d the writer and critic Greg Tate recalled. \u201cHe would act out all the parts.\u201d Tate and Jafa connected when they were both returning books to the Founders Library at Howard. They talked for six hours on the library steps, and the conversation has been going on ever since.", "Jafa also spent time in art galleries and museums, and immersed himself in art history and theory. His fascination with Marcel Duchamp kept surfacing in our conversations. \u201cMy whole understanding of Duchamp has to do with African artifacts, aesthetic artifacts, and their profound effect on Western art,\u201d Jafa said. Picasso, Matisse, Derain, and other artists in Paris during the early years of the twentieth century had discovered African sculpture at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Ethnographie du Trocad\u00e9ro, and it had changed the way they saw the world. \u201cAll those people used African artifacts to make paintings, because they had certain spatial and formal implications, and the massing of those implications produced Cubism,\u201d Jafa said. \u201cDuchamp made paintings in that modality\u2014\u2018Nude Descending a Staircase,\u2019 where you see the figure multiple times at the same moment and from different vantage points. But Duchamp was smarter than anybody around. I think he realized that a lot of the energy produced by African objects came not from their formal and spatial qualities but from their being what I would call radically alienated. It was contextual. An African artifact in a white museum space, with all this baggage of ideas about painting and contemplation, was deeply alien.\u201d", "Jafa believes that Duchamp\u2019s 1917 \u201cFountain,\u201d a porcelain urinal from a plumbing-supply store, turned upside down and signed \u201cR. Mutt,\u201d was directly influenced by African sculpture and drew its undeniable power from the same sort of radical alienation. \u201cWhat Duchamp did better than any other artist was to take something that existed and turn it into another thing,\u201d Jafa said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make it\u2014he turned it into something else. It\u2019s like what I say about Black people and basketball. We didn\u2019t invent basketball, but we created it. One of the more telling things about Black people is that we do things that don\u2019t make our job easier. Why do a three-sixty before you land a basketball? You don\u2019t get more points\u2014it just raises your level of difficulty. What is that about?\u201d (His voice went up about an octave.) \u201cFolks argue that it\u2019s entertainment, but it\u2019s central to who we are. It\u2019s refusing the structures that want to turn the game into a business. We know it\u2019s a business\u2014winning\u2014but we refuse to acquiesce in the elimination of play. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big leap to say that\u2019s central to Duchamp\u2019s entire practice. For all the intellectualism around Duchamp, what did he always insist on? That it was playful. His tongue was definitely in his cheek.\u201d", "So was Jafa\u2019s when he revealed his \u201csecret theory\u201d that Jeff Koons is \u201ca very light-skinned Black guy passing for white.\u201d He argued, \u201cLook at the works that made his reputation. The vacuum cleaners refer to Black women, domestic workers. The two basketballs floating in vitrines, I insist, are testicles, connoting everything from castration to Black sexual prowess. The bunny rabbit, which most people say is his masterpiece, is clearly Brer Rabbit.\u201d Jafa went on in this vein for quite a while before returning to Duchamp.", "\u201cHe is one of the non-musicians I would put in the company of John Coltrane and Miles Davis,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were occasionally white people at our family reunions, in-laws and white friends of my parents. Duchamp is one of the people we will always reserve a seat for.\u201d", "Arthur Jafa on the set of \u201cDaughters of the Dust\u201d in 1989. Photograph by Kerry James Marshall", "In 1999, Jafa decided to quit the film world. He wasn\u2019t getting any closer to directing his own films, and it seemed to him that the art world offered more opportunities to realize the ideas swarming in his head. He\u2019d been interested in art since his second year at Howard, when one of his architecture teachers sent the class to see I. M. Pei\u2019s new East Building, at the National Gallery of Art. \u201cThere was an exhibition of Mark Rothko, eight brownish paintings that all looked the same to my untrained eye, and they infuriated me,\u201d Jafa recalled. \u201cI told the instructor it was bullshit. I was irate. I went back to that show ten times, kept going back, couldn\u2019t get it out of my mind. I was obsessed. He\u2019s still my favorite painter.\u201d", "Twenty years later, when Jafa decided to do \u201cthis art thing,\u201d success came almost immediately. A group of his short videos appeared in the 2000 Whitney Biennial\u2014one of the curators, Valerie Cassel Oliver, described them in ARTnews as \u201cvery subtle, very poetic.\u201d Jafa\u2019s \u201cTree\u201d was included in the Whitney\u2019s \u201cBitStreams\u201d exhibition a year later; it\u2019s an eight-minute video of a blurry, constantly moving tree that looks like it\u2019s escaped from a Monet painting and gone off on its own. Other art works by Jafa appeared in group shows in this country and abroad: a metal bench he had found on a visit to Bamako, Mali; a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, resting on a frame that gave it the appearance of floating; a video of a man in a yellow jacket lying on a sidewalk with people walking past. By 2005, though, the overbearing whiteness of the art world had driven him back to filmmaking. \u201cI was invited to parties where I was the only Black person,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t feel right, so I walked away from the art world.\u201d", "In 2002, at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in New York, he met Sun\u00e9 Woods, a young woman on her way to becoming an artist. \u201cIt was almost like a force turned me around, and I said to Greg Tate, \u2018Hey, man, who is that? I\u2019m going to marry her.\u2019 \u201d Woods and Jafa never married, but in 2004 they had a son, Ayler. \u201cThen we just fell apart,\u201d Jafa said. \u201cSun\u00e9 said she was going to graduate school in San Francisco and taking Ayler with her, and that was terrifying to me, because I\u2019d had the same experience when I split up with Julie.\u201d Jafa commuted between New York and San Francisco for two years, before moving to Los Angeles in 2010. He wanted to be closer to Ayler, and also to N\u2019Zinga, who was living with her mother in L.A. Dash had built an impressive reputation as a director of film biographies (she\u2019s currently doing one on Angela Davis), and she and Jafa had never been out of touch. (\u201cWe\u2019re still best friends,\u201d Dash told me recently. Their first grandchild, Adrian Julian Arana, born to N\u2019Zinga in 2017, brought them even closer.) When Jafa moved to Los Angeles, his self-confidence was at a low ebb. The film industry seemed less and less interested in hiring him. He was approaching fifty, and he felt as though he hadn\u2019t achieved any of his goals. His friends were worried. \u201cHe was like a falling star,\u201d John Akomfrah said. \u201cHe\u2019d always been a figure of such promise. All of us expected something great to happen, and as the years went by some people were thinking maybe it wasn\u2019t going to come.\u201d", "In 2011, he hit rock bottom. Depressed and suicidal, he went to stay with his parents, in Atlanta. (\u201cYou can always come home,\u201d they had told their children.) After the breakup with Dash, Jafa had dealt with his depression by going into therapy. This time, the film world intervened. Sitting in his parents\u2019 living room, wondering what to do with his broken life, he got a telephone call from Paul Garnes, a Hollywood producer who worked with the showrunner Salim Akil. \u201cPaul said I was like a mythical beast, because everybody out there had heard of me but nobody knew me,\u201d Jafa told me. He had called to see if Jafa was available to shoot the pilot for a new TV series, a comedy-drama like \u201cEntourage,\u201d about Black people, that Akil was directing. \u201cAvailable? I was broke and out of work. The producers must have liked the pilot, because they asked me to shoot the series\u2014for a shitful of money. I thought, Well, maybe just grow the fuck up and take the money.\u201d", "Jafa used the forty-five thousand dollars he\u2019d been paid for the pilot to buy a new Prius and to rent a small apartment in L.A. The series wasn\u2019t picked up, though, and he had to find something to do right away\u2014he was determined not to sink back into despair. Kahlil Joseph, a filmmaker and a close friend, called to say that ZDF, a German public-television network, had commissioned him to make a documentary about the March on Washington, whose fiftieth anniversary was coming up in 2013. Joseph had scheduling conflicts. Would Jafa be interested in directing it? Jafa said he would\u2014and he had ideas about how. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in looking back,\u201d Jafa told me. \u201cI was interested in where Black people are now. I wrote a really insane, crazy treatment that had very little to do with the March on Washington, and they gave me the money and I went off and did it. And that was the beginning of the work I\u2019m doing now.\u201d", "Jafa\u2019s film, called \u201cDreams Are Colder Than Death,\u201d is a fifty-two-minute collage of brief and not so brief interviews with African-American artists, writers, filmmakers, academics, and friends, alternating or coinciding with images of houses and back yards, waves breaking over rocks, Civil War photographs, extreme closeups of eyes, mouths, and faces, photographs of Martin Luther King, Jr., and James Baldwin. The speakers pull no punches, and what comes through is an orchestrated assault of incendiary thinking about racism. There were financial disagreements with a producer, and \u201cDreams\u201d wasn\u2019t televised in the U.S. But it was shown in 2014 at the BlackStar Film Festival, in Philadelphia, and at the New York Film Festival. By then, Jafa had started working on a project that he called \u201cAPEX.\u201d", "Close to eight hundred separate images flash by in \u201cAPEX\u201d \u2019s eight minutes and twenty-two seconds, against a pounding techno beat: a man\u2019s deeply scarred back, Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse, the fiery surface of the sun, a cartoon shark, lynchings, Sojourner Truth, Aretha Franklin, a cross-legged monk on fire, movie stills of white actors in blackface, Black people being fire-hosed, a 1920 Harlem street parade beneath a sign that reads \u201cThe New Negro Has No Fear.\u201d Jafa worked on \u201cApex\u201d for four years, off and on, without knowing what it was. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand it as a film, or as art,\u201d he told me. \u201cI assumed it was an internal document that I showed to my friends.\u201d", "Early in 2016, working again as a cinematographer and staying in a New York hotel room between jobs, Jafa put together the basic elements of \u201cLove Is the Message, the Message Is Death.\u201d There was no concept and no script. \u201cIt was a response to the influx of footage of Black people being assaulted, which I had just been throwing in a file.\u201d A week later, he heard Kanye West\u2019s \u201cUltralight Beam\u201d performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and decided to use it as the soundtrack\u2014without notifying West or getting permission. (West\u2019s reaction, when he and Jafa met, in 2020, was to say that Jafa\u2019s film had brought him \u201cback to life,\u201d and to hire him to direct a music video for the song \u201cWash Us in the Blood.\u201d) Jafa showed an early version of \u201cLove Is the Message\u201d to Greg Tate, Fred Moten, Saidiya Hartman, the cinematographer Bradford Young, and other friends. Tate said, \u201cThere\u2019s something about the construction of it, the flow and the velocity, that\u2019s very much the way young people experience the Internet. It resonates with this generation\u2019s hip-hop culture.\u201d", "\u201cI just never got into the whole Nativity scene.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Bruce Eric Kaplan", "Jafa wanted to post the film on YouTube, but Kahlil Joseph urged him not to give it away. Joseph screened it several times on film nights at the Underground Museum, in Los Angeles, as an unannounced opener for the main feature. Soon afterward, in June, Joseph showed it to a small, private audience in Switzerland during Art Basel, the international art fair. Gavin Brown, a British-born artist who had become a New York art dealer, and who had a long history of finding and nurturing new talent, saw it there. \u201cI remember being stuck to my chair, eyes wide, trying to keep up with it, and then as it ended I felt the air being expelled from my body,\u201d he said."], "authors": ["Calvin Tomkins", "Calvin Tomkin"], "keywords": ["white", "told", "say", "went", "black", "arthur", "film", "alienation", "york", "films", "art", "radical", "jafas", "jafa"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
