First comes the visit to your doctor, where you receive the (hopefully) happy news. Then comes the Talk, which goes something like: \u201cRemember to take it easy for the next nine months. Pamper yourself. Get lots of sleep. And don\u2019t eat any deli meats, or you could murder your baby.\u201d O.K., this might not be exactly what the doctor says, but it\u2019s what many women hear. Daily life takes on a frightening new dimension. Is there toxoplasmosis on the cat\u2019s butt? Is the hair salon full of poisonous fumes? Complicating things is the gap between the official recommendations and what people actually do. The handout says stick to \u201cone small cup\u201d of coffee and stay away from alcohol. But we all know that the coffee thing is B.S., and that it\u2019s perfectly fine to have a glass of wine, because . . . they do it in France, right? What about that trending Times article, \u201cEating Nuts During Pregnancy Tied to Brain Benefits in Baby\u201d? Or the fact that Kourtney Kardashian avoided microwaves after she had a baby? Navigating this gantlet, when I was pregnant, I called a friend who had recently given birth. She cut me off, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a book you need to read.\u201d The book was by Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University who studies health care. In her day job, she pores over medical journals and government data sets for insights into how we treat diseases such as Huntington\u2019s, diabetes, and H.I.V./AIDS. In 2010, Oster got pregnant. Confronted with the usual mixed messages\u2014her doctor told her that a glass of wine was \u201cprobably O.K.\u201d\u2014she went home, logged in to PubMed, a database of medical literature, and downloaded every study on alcohol and caffeine going back to the nineteen-eighties. She then spent several days performing a personal meta-analysis: evaluating the merits of the studies, throwing out the weak ones, and making an assessment of the risks. (Her conclusion: a glass of wine a day in the second or third trimester wasn\u2019t a problem, and she could keep drinking coffee guilt-free.) Oster\u2019s research expanded into her 2013 book, \u201cExpecting Better,\u201d which became a hit among pregnant women\u2014at least among the subset of pregnant women with the time and resources to devote to issues like caffeine dosage and sushi intake. In the book, Oster recounts the choices that she faced during her pregnancy and tackles such topics as prohibited foods, weight gain, and C-sections, frequently dismantling the received wisdom. Flatteringly, she addresses her reader as a peer. She doesn\u2019t issue opaque decrees, with the implicit condescension of \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m an expert.\u201d She doesn\u2019t slip into cutesy jargon, like the pun-prone authors of the latest edition of \u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting,\u201d who call pregnant women \u201cMama\u201d and suggest that you \u201cstart every morning with a bump selfie.\u201d Instead, she takes the reader on a tour of the scientific literature, even describing the methodology of specific studies to show how she made each decision. Lauren Kay, the executive editor of the pregnancy and parenting Web site the Bump, explained Oster\u2019s appeal to me in an e-mail: \u201cThe whole tone of the book is very pro-Mom, putting the power back in the hands of the pregnant woman. I read it when I was pregnant with my first child, and it left me feeling empowered to ask my OB why or why not. It also reminded me that I was part of the equation, too.\u201d Despite the plaudits, the book didn\u2019t go over well with many public-health officials, who disagreed especially vehemently with Oster\u2019s conclusions about alcohol. The president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, on Boston\u2019s NPR station, that Oster\u2019s advice was wrong: \u201cWe need to err on the side of caution, and the side of caution says that we have not been able to identify any amount of alcohol that is absolutely safe in pregnancy.\u201d But Oster\u2019s fans were undeterred. Amy Schumer called Oster \u201cthe non-judgmental girlfriend holding our hand and guiding us through pregnancy and motherhood.\u201d Last month, Oster published a sequel, \u201cCribsheet,\u201d subtitled \u201cA Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool.\u201d It takes on subjects like cold season, nap schedules, and potty training. As the mother of a sixteen-month-old, I had a host of burning questions: Will she ever willingly wear clothes? Is it wrong to buy those little kids\u2019 leashes? Why does she put her finger in other babies\u2019 mouths and say, \u201cBite\u201d?", "Parenting experts have been around for as long as there have been anxious parents. They have channelled the fears and the aspirations of their times. Eighteenth-century parents adopted Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s ideas about \u201cnatural\u201d parenting\u2014cold air is good for a child!\u2014even though he\u2019d left all five of his children at a foundling hospital. Dr. Spock, who had trained in psychoanalysis, gave parenting advice a Freudian spin, and his mantra\u2014\u201cTrust yourself. You know more than you think you do\u201d\u2014soothed addled Cold War parents. It makes sense that our parenting expert du jour is a data wonk. In some ways, data are to today\u2019s parents what psychoanalysis was to the postwar generation: a hoped-for savior. We try to make sense of a chaotic world by reading Nate Silver\u2019s political forecasts and wearing devices that count our steps. At the same time, Big Data is increasingly sinister. If you\u2019ve been pregnant lately, you\u2019ve undoubtedly had the eerie experience of seeing baby-related ads popping up online before you\u2019ve shared the news with anyone. The information age has turned out to be a breeding ground for misinformation, with \u201cMoneyball\u201d giving way to Twitter bots, viral pseudoscience, and dubious Facebook news feeds. Oster is here to help you navigate this glut. As a pop-economist, she follows in the tradition of Steven Levitt, of \u201cFreakonomics\u201d fame. Levitt, who has six children, including two who are younger than three, told me that Oster\u2019s first book \u201cis the bible of my circle.\u201d At a time when pregnancy and child rearing have become polarized and moralized\u2014natural births, water births, orgasmic births?\u2014it can be refreshing to hear from someone who sticks to the numbers. \u201cEconomists focus on how the world is,\u201d Levitt told me. \u201cA lot of parenting advice is focussed on how the world should be in someone\u2019s mind.\u201d What did I want from Oster\u2019s books? Until recently, most of life\u2019s outcomes seemed within my control. If I exercised, I could get in shape. (Not that I ever did.) If I worked hard at school, and then at my job, I could earn good grades and promotions. But becoming a parent was different. No matter how many pregnancy apps I downloaded, I couldn\u2019t control when I would get pregnant, or if it would go well. And, after the baby arrived, I seemed to be stuck in crisis mode. The data seemed like a way to get back, if not power, then at least a sense of mastery. Oster now has two children, Penelope and Finn, who are eight and four. She spends most of her days in her office at Brown, where she is currently researching methodological problems with data on health trends (vitamins, superfoods). Given the subject matter of her books, I thought it best to see her in the domestic sphere. I arrived at her home, in Providence, Rhode Island, at 6:30 a.m. It was still dark outside. Oster was standing at her kitchen counter in working-mom attire: a black business skirt and stockings, with a zip-up hoodie over her blouse to protect it from grubby hands. The place was neat but minimally furnished\u2014an indication, to me, that she wasn\u2019t especially interested in interior decorating. But I knew from her books that she likes to sew, and there were two plates of attractive muffins on the counter. She\u2019d gotten up at 5 a.m. to bake. Oster has striking blue eyes and short, straight brown hair. In person, as in her writing, she combines extreme practicality with a dry sense of humor. In a chapter in \u201cCribsheet\u201d about staying at home versus working, she writes that, while she loves her children, \u201cthe marginal value of time with my kids declines fast.\u201d In a section on milk oversupply during breast-feeding, she mentions gua-sha therapy, a skin-scraping treatment, and adds, \u201cGwyneth Paltrow swears by this, so take what you will from that.\u201d From the books, I also knew a good deal about Oster\u2019s family. Her husband, Jesse Shapiro, is an economist at Brown as well, known for his work on political polarization, and her parents are both economists at Yale. As a child in the nineteen-eighties, Oster said, \u201cwe were the only people who ordered groceries from the grocery store.\u201d When young Emily asked her mother, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ever go to the store, like regular people?,\u201d her mother told her, \u201cBecause my time is very valuable. I have a high opportunity cost.\u201d Naturally, Oster recalled, \u201cI was, like, Oh, O.K. That makes sense.\u201d Oster was a precocious child. When she was not yet two, she often talked to herself before she fell asleep at night. One day, her mother mentioned this habit to a woman at a faculty gathering. The woman, a developmental psychologist named Katherine Nelson, was intrigued. She asked Emily\u2019s mother if she\u2019d consider recording the toddler\u2019s monologues. For about a year, Emily\u2019s parents placed a tape recorder under the crib every night before putting her to bed. Nelson and a group of colleagues eventually published a book of essays about the tapes, called \u201cNarratives from the Crib,\u201d which is still in print. Oster told me, \u201cThere were friends of mine in college who read it as part of their psychology syllabus.\u201d \u201cNarratives from the Crib\u201d is not an easy read. The authors, linguists and psychoanalysts, investigate Emily\u2019s use of pronouns, and the contrast between her private speech and her social speech. But the monologues are fascinating for anyone who has ever wondered how toddlers think. Baby Emily discusses her favorite foods (including \u201cp-water,\u201d or Perrier), the family\u2019s sleeping arrangements, and a dream about an alligator. She recites the schedule of the buses that appear on the street outside her house: \u201c1 2 3 4 days we have yellow buses, but not 5 4 5 4 5 have blue buses. . . .\u201d And she spends hours going over her daily routine. Her childcare schedule is split between nursery school and day care at the home of a woman named Tanta. She carpools with a boy named Carl: Sometimes I stay with Tanta all week. And sometimes we play mom and dad. . . . But today I\u2019m going to nursery school in the morning. . . . We\u2019re going to eat breakfast like we usually do, and then we\u2019re going to . . . play. . . . Then the doorbell\u2019s going to ring, and here comes Carl in here . . . and then we are all going to play . . . and drive to nursery. It\u2019s tempting to judge \u201cNarratives from the Crib\u201d by Oster\u2019s methodological standards and find it lacking. Baby Emily isn\u2019t representative of most, or even many, two-year-olds. But that isn\u2019t the point: the authors are comparing Emily with herself in different contexts and at different stages of her development. And the monologues are highly representative of Oster today. Reading them, \u201cI see a lot of my adult processing in my two-year-old self, which is sort of creepy,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis need to think about: What happened today? What is going to happen tomorrow? I don\u2019t do it out loud anymore, but I still do versions of this.\u201d Oster still keeps a precise schedule. After we\u2019d talked for a while, I asked if she wanted to wake up the children. She shook her head. It was 6:45 a.m. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have five minutes.\u201d At exactly 6:50, Oster went upstairs and stuck her head through the doorway of Penelope\u2019s room, saying, \u201cHi, love. Can you get dressed?\u201d Penelope rubbed her eyes. Oster proceeded to Finn\u2019s bedroom. \u201cHi, Finn-o. What are you doing? I made muffins.\u201d Finn bolted upright. Oster ducked into his closet, swiftly selecting clothes. Addressing me, Finn asked, \u201cWould you like to listen to the book that Mom\u2019s going to read to me?\u201d \u201cWhat do you want me to read?\u201d Oster asked. \u201c \u2018Ralph Tells a Story\u2019?\u201d Finn nodded. She sat on the bed and read the book at the pace of a podcast playing at 1.5 speed. Penelope crept in, wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt and pink leggings, with a red bow in her hair. At 7:05, Oster hustled the kids down to the kitchen for breakfast. She set out a plate of sliced strawberries alongside the muffins. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to have fruit,\u201d she said. Mother and children sat around the table, Finn wearing a T-shirt and Stormtrooper underpants. \u201cGuess what,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are on backward.\u201d The Stormtrooper logo was on the rear, so he\u2019d turned them around. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible underwear design,\u201d Oster said. We talked about their weekend plans, and about a Japanese restaurant where they\u2019d recently eaten. \u201cYou sit on a tatami mat,\u201d Penelope told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing where you sit on the floor, and there\u2019s a really low table. I found out about it when I started studying Japan in school. I studied Japan for three months.\u201d With her quick, orderly thinking, she reminded me of Baby Emily. She went on, \u201cNow that I\u2019m done with Japan, I\u2019m studying family.\u201d Oster asked, \u201cAre you going to write about our family?\u201d Penelope was interrupted by Finn, who shouted, \u201cMore fizzy water!\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d Oster said, and refilled his glass.", "\u201cCribsheet\u201d is different from Oster\u2019s first book, in part because pregnancy and parenting are different. When you\u2019re pregnant, the choices you face are more discrete\u2014Should I agree to this procedure? Should I order this entr\u00e9e?\u2014and you generally have time to think things through. \u201cWhen you have a kid, it\u2019s like someone is shooting you in the face with a fire hose,\u201d Oster said. \u201cParticularly at the beginning. Every day there\u2019s another decision: Should I be swaddling her? Should he be circumcised? The breast-feeding isn\u2019t working! Should I use this breast-feeding supplement thing that gets taped on my boob? What kind of bottles should we buy? Should I use this formula or that formula? She\u2019s not sleeping! Where should she sleep?\u201d At first, Oster and her husband made decisions on the fly, like everyone else. They ricocheted between various sleep-training techniques and ordered too much gear from Amazon. When a night nanny advised, \u201cYou have to get the Miracle Blanket\u201d\u2014a swaddling product\u2014Oster said, \u201cI was, like, \u2018Great, let\u2019s order ten of them!\u2019 \u201d With Finn, she was able to step back and take a more programmatic approach. She dug into the data on such topics as sleep and childcare, asking, \u201cWhat, ideally, should I have done?\u201d The answer wasn\u2019t always clear. For one thing, there isn\u2019t much data on the nonmedical aspects of child rearing, such as the effects of screen time on kids. Even where data exist, they\u2019re not very conclusive. \u201cCan you eat sushi when you\u2019re pregnant? Yes, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Oster said, by way of example. \u201cShould you sleep with your baby? There\u2019s a lot less of a right answer.\u201d That\u2019s not to say that people won\u2019t tell you there\u2019s a right answer. Exhibit A is breast-feeding. After I gave birth, I was surprised to discover that many people\u2014even men\u2014would ask, \u201cAre you breast-feeding?\u201d I soon realized that the question was an indicator of our collective anxiety about the subject. By the nineteen-seventies, after the baby-formula industry aggressively marketed its product to doctors, breast-feeding had declined precipitously in the U.S. It was revived in the nineteen-eighties, thanks to large-scale public-health campaigns, and later to studies showing such health benefits as improved metabolism and higher I.Q. If you\u2019ve been pregnant in the past forty years, you\u2019ve no doubt been on the receiving end of these campaigns\u2014from the poster in the doctor\u2019s office announcing \u201cBreast Is Best!\u201d to the Instagram influencer doing yoga while a baby suckles peacefully at her nipple. If you\u2019re a certain kind of person\u2014for example, me\u2014you\u2019ve come away thinking, Message received! I am one hundred per cent, absolutely breast-feeding! But there\u2019s a hitch: there\u2019s a small, squalling person who also has a say in the matter. My daughter quickly developed a firm preference for the bottle over the breast. At first, I overruled her, but, as the lactation consultant informed me, \u201cShe just likes the feeling of plastic.\u201d At around five months old, she began screaming with horror whenever she glimpsed my nipple. It was . . . insulting? When I called my mother to vent, she said that I\u2019d rejected her nipple, too. \u201cI\u2019m still very hurt,\u201d my mother added. Oster frequently gets e-mails from distraught mothers who are convinced that, because they\u2019ve failed at breast-feeding, they\u2019ve doomed their offspring to a life of dim-wittedness and obesity. \u201cThe saddest are from the husbands, saying, \u2018Is there any information you can give me? I just want to be able to tell my wife it\u2019s not so terrible if this doesn\u2019t work,\u2019 \u201d Oster said. After reviewing the literature, Oster believes that the health benefits of breast-feeding are real, but that they have been oversold. She zeroes in on the issue at the center of so many debates about medical research: determining causality. It\u2019s tricky to study breast-feeding. In an ideal experiment, you\u2019d take a large group of newborns and randomly assign half of them to be reared on formula and the other half to be breast-fed. But, for obvious ethical reasons, we don\u2019t experiment on infants. So researchers are left mainly with observational studies, which examine the babies whose mothers have chosen to breast-feed. In the U.S., these women tend to be wealthier and better educated than other moms\u2014a result of many factors, including the fact that breast-feeding is time-consuming and that, to do it comfortably, you need sufficient paid leave. Do breast-fed babies thrive because of breast-feeding, or because their parents have more money and higher academic degrees? In many areas, such as obesity and I.Q., Oster argues that it\u2019s the latter. Only a few studies meet her standards: sibling studies, in which one child is breast-fed and the other isn\u2019t, and a large randomized controlled trial in Belarus, in the nineteen-nineties. (Breast-feeding rates were low, and researchers encouraged half the mothers to take up the practice.) From these studies, she draws two firm conclusions: breast-feeding reduces gastrointestinal problems, like diarrhea, and rashes, like eczema, in a baby\u2019s first year. Important, but, as Oster told me, \u201cif it doesn\u2019t work, the parents should say, \u2018Well, maybe my kid will have more difficulty pooping for a few months.\u2019 Not \u2018There go five I.Q. points!\u2019 \u201d Another question that people often ask new mothers: \u201cIs your baby a good sleeper?\u201d Sleep is a fraught topic, in part because it\u2019s stalked by the world\u2019s scariest acronym: SIDS, or sudden infant-death syndrome. Over the years, official recommendations for avoiding SIDS have changed dramatically. When I was a child, my mother put me to sleep on my stomach, surrounded by bumpers and stuffed animals. Today, that would probably get you reported to Child Protective Services. Other practices, such as \u201cco-sleeping\u201d\u2014letting a baby sleep in your bed\u2014are, officially, against recommendations and, unofficially, something that people do all the time. Co-sleepers sometimes contend that the safety warnings are too stringent, and Oster provides them with some support. She argues that the increased risk of SIDS associated with co-sleeping has a lot to do with other parental behaviors. If you\u2019re drinking and smoking, it\u2019s dangerous. If you abstain from those activities, and take other precautions, like removing blankets from the bed, the risk of your baby\u2019s dying is .22 deaths per thousand births\u2014still elevated, but less than the risk of your baby\u2019s dying in a car accident. In other words, Oster said, \u201ca reasonable person could make that choice,\u201d especially if it\u2019s helping the entire family sleep. Economics is a science of decision-making. A major refrain of Oster\u2019s book is that a parent\u2019s preferences are important. What do you want? That seems an obvious consideration when you\u2019re selecting a new car, but less so when the decision involves your child. \u201cIn the first book, there\u2019s a central tension between people and the medical establishment,\u201d Oster told me. In the second book, \u201cit\u2019s between you and society. Or you and your own parental guilt.\u201d", "Why is child rearing so touchy? Why does it cause us to engage in Facebook flame wars, and to think terrible thoughts about our dearest friends? Ann Hulbert, the author of \u201cRaising America: Experts, Parents, and a Century of Advice About Children,\u201d told me that, in recent years, parenthood has taken on an uneasy dual role in American life. \u201cIt\u2019s become both the proving ground for our virtue and the deeply insecure ground on which we hope to create a life of greater economic security for our children,\u201d she said. The U.S., she added, hasn\u2019t had a single voice of authority on the subject in decades. After Dr. Spock, numerous experts popped up, often with conflicting advice. Then came the Internet. \u201cWe\u2019re now in an era where mothers and parents can talk to one another, a throwback to this nostalgic time, pre-expert, when mothers gathered at the village well,\u201d Hulbert went on. That sounds nice. \u201cBut, actually, it can be horrible! Mothers are perfectly free to be judgmental, dictatorial, and obsessive, and it multiplies anxieties.\u201d Oster believes that the Mommy Wars arise from a kind of loss aversion. \u201cPeople get the idea that what they do must be the right thing. Especially since some of these things are very hard,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, if you spent a year lugging your breast pump through airports and pumping in the bathroom at LaGuardia, just so you could keep breast-feeding, it\u2019s hard to later say, \u2018Oh, actually, that wasn\u2019t really so important for my kid. I just did it because I liked it.\u2019 \u201d In April, Oster participated in a lunchtime Q. & A. session with new mothers at a pillow-filled space on Brown\u2019s campus, over plates of Indian food. The audience was made up of graduate students and young professors\u2014all passionate Osterites. A woman from the professional-studies program said, \u201cI want to treat you like this oracle who can answer anything!\u201d She had a question about weaning. \u201cMy son is twenty months old, and I can\u2019t figure out how to stop breast-feeding him,\u201d she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much data on that,\u201d Oster replied, apologetically. (It\u2019s not a common enough problem to attract researchers, she explained.) She offered, \u201cI quit when my son bit me at eleven months. I was, like, \u2018Aaah!\u2019 And he never wanted to do it again.\u201d The conversation soon turned to mommy bloggers. What to do about them? And what, one woman asked, do you say to the \u201cparents and aunts and uncles and stuff who all have their own opinions?\u201d Oster gave the group a pep talk. \u201cThat lady on the Internet is not living in your house,\u201d she said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what the right thing is for your son\u2019s penis. And so you shouldn\u2019t let her tell you whether circumcision is a good idea or not.\u201d Part of her goal, Oster explained, was for \u201cpeople to feel more confident in the choices that they make. And be able to appreciate that other people made different choices without feeling bad.\u201d", "By the time I finished \u201cCribsheet,\u201d I was feeling very empowered. I knew my preferences, and I had obtained the relevant data. I was becoming a pro at data-driven parenting. Then I spoke to people in the medical establishment, and my sense of certainty fell apart. Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter, the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Section on Breastfeeding, told me that Oster is getting it all wrong. Public-health experts have specific ways of interpreting research, and Oster wasn\u2019t following those protocols. \u201cThat\u2019s the really scary part of having a person like Oster, who is not an epidemiologist, distilling this information to the lay public,\u201d Feldman-Winter told me. \u201cIt\u2019s basically as bad as the anti-vaxxers.\u201d Apparently, if I\u2019d really wanted data, I should have downloaded the U.S. government\u2019s recent summary review on breast-feeding, which found evidence of long-term effects that Oster dismisses, including a reduction in asthma and in Type 1 diabetes. Feldman-Winter told me about how human milk raises the I.Q. of preterm babies, and how exclusive breast-feeding\u2014with no formula\u2014seeds the lower intestinal tract with good bacteria, protecting against inflammatory-bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s, and ulcerative colitis. Oh dear. Now I felt truly awful. Why had I given up so soon? Feldman-Winter tried to reassure me: \u201cYou did the best you could.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Oster stood by her analysis. \u201cThere are many ways to collate this literature,\u201d she told me. And economists are extremely skeptical of the methods that epidemiologists use. Whom, then, to believe? Such arguments come up all the time in discussions of medical research. They are a reminder that, far from being infallible, data can be slippery. Preferences, too. They\u2019re informed by all kinds of factors: sentiment, lived experience, religious beliefs. In reporting this story, I found that, the more I learned about breast-feeding, the more passionate I became about it. Like Oster, I was an unapologetic wine-sipper during pregnancy. But, after speaking to doctors who have treated fetal alcohol syndrome, I wished that I could take back even the tiniest drop. Is this rational? Perhaps not.
