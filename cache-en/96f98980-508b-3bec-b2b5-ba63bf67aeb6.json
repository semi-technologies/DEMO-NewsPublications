They're getting locked down. You have to hand it to the brilliance of the small business owner in America right now, because these people are being so creative, finding new ways to be able to serve their customers and put food on the table for their families. But what's going on is the government says, hey, you know what? We're just going to give you $1200. Then they locked you down, destroyed all of your years and years of hard work. And then now that you are starting to claw your way back out of it, you're up to debt to your eyeballs, we're going to lock it down again. It's disgusting.
