In most cases it\u2019s from the bedroom to the living room, though some have the luxury of a study. Overnight, they\u2019ve waved goodbye to all those watercooler conversations, jokes and chats with colleagues, and meetings. And now, over four months later, the results of all that working from home are very apparent: people are tired, empty, burnt out.", "In a survey by the CNV trade union federation, more than a third of workers said they felt more work pressure than ever before as a result of the pandemic. Twenty-one percent said they and their colleagues were taking more sick leave, and 16 percent described themselves as exhausted by their work.", "Piet Fortuin, the organisation\u2019s chair, says the figures are shocking. \u2018If you extrapolate them to the whole country, millions of people are overworked, and more than a million are exhausted.\u2019", "Striking a balance", "Brain expert Mark Tigchelaar is not surprised that people get tired when they work from home. He says almost everything has been digitalised, from long meetings to quick conversations, and people are never out of reach.", "\u201cYou\u2019re constantly trying to strike a balance between productivity and contactability. If your boss or a colleague sends you a message, you respond quickly to show that you\u2019re hard at work. It sounds positive, but it often distracts you from what you\u2019re trying to do.\u2019", "During lockdown, there were even more distractions. Some were intrinsic, like feeling anxious when you watched the news, and worrying about the future. Others were extrinsic: some people constantly had to juggle the roles of parent, teacher, and employee. Multitasking is not good for your productivity or energy, Tigchelaar explains, because your brain needs time to concentrate.", "\u2018Every time you switch to a different task, you\u2019re back to square one. You lose focus, and regaining it takes time and energy. People often don\u2019t get much work done during the day, and make up for it by putting in extra hours in the evening.\u2019", "Before you know where you are, he says, you\u2019re working excessively long hours and not getting enough rest at night, or at all. Being permanently available is extremely tiring for the brain.", "Tigchelaar uses the car as a metaphor for the importance of rest. \u2018You can\u2019t keep your foot on the gas pedal all the time. Eventually you run out of gas and have to stop and refuel. It\u2019s exactly the same with your brain: you need breaks to become productive again and focus on the task in hand.\u2019", "Discipline", "Even if they are able to switch off from work, many people have been drained by the lockdown. \u2018The corona pandemic has created chronic stress,\u2019 says Paul van Lange, a lecturer in psychology at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. \u2018All of a sudden we\u2019ve had to change our behaviour. We have to keep our distance in the street, visits to the supermarket have become an ordeal for many people, and all the negative reporting and fear of the virus don\u2019t help.", "\u2018Staying alert all the time takes self control and discipline, and consumes energy. We\u2019re spending all day \u2018switched on\u2019, and it\u2019s making us all tired, even people who are retired or otherwise not working.\u2019", "Van Lange points out that there are also fewer opportunities for relaxation at the moment. Bars and restaurants may be open, and so are theatres and cinemas, subject to restrictions \u2013 but if you\u2019re stuck at home working, you may well be suffering from a deficiency of vitamin S \u2013 socialising.", "\u2018It\u2019s vital to have easy access to social contacts in a healthy working environment,\u2019 Van Lange says. \u2018Laughing together, giving and receiving compliments, sharing positive experiences: these are all things that give you energy. It\u2019s not the same doing it indirectly in a video call, where you have to wait your turn to speak and there\u2019s no spontaneity.\u2019", "No new stimuli", "There are lots of reasons why so many of us are feeling tired, or even exhausted, this summer. The tank is emptying quicker than it\u2019s being filled, and we need to adapt to the new normal if we\u2019re to continue functioning in the longer term.", "Tigchelaar wrote a book entitled Focus AAN/UIT (Focus ON/OFF) using scientific research to explain how people can concentrate better and reduce their stress levels. He swears by what he calls buutvrijmomenten, those quiet, solitary moments in a game of tag when you\u2019re in a safe zone where no one can get you. These are opportunities to recharge, he says. \u2018They only happen when your brain is not receiving any new stimuli and can rest for a while.\u2019", "And that doesn\u2019t mean going for a stroll while listening to a podcast or scrolling through your Instagram feed. \u2018If you do that, your brain is still receiving stimuli that it has to process, and that uses up energy. Doing something nice and recharging your brain are not the same thing.\u2019", "So how does he recharge his? \u2018Just wander around,\u2019 he says. \u2018Do nothing in particular, daydream. That\u2019s the way to do it.\u2019"], "authors": ["Raounak Khaddari"], "keywords": ["lockdown", "suffering", "brain", "energy", "youre", "tired", "focus", "netherlands", "chronic", "working", "lange", "receiving", "fatigue", "work", "rest", "stress"], "pubDate": "2020-08-07T14:14:57+02:00", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
