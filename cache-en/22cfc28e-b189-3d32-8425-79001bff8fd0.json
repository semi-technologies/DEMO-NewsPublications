They have just a few hours over a multi-course meal to unstick negotiations that are deadlocked on key aspects of the future relationship for the EU and Britain.", "Johnson's press secretary, Allegra Stratton, said the prime minister and von der Leyen \u201cboth believe that there needs to be some political momentum now.\u201d Johnson's office said that if the two leaders agree, their chief negotiators \u2014 who will both attend Wednesday's dinner \u2014 could resume talks on a final deal.", "BREXIT NEGOTIATIONS AT A STALEMATE AS BRITAIN, EU FREE-TRADE DEAL TEETERING ON COLLAPSE", "But the two sides gave ominously opposing views of the main sticking points \u2014 and each insisted the other must move to reach an agreement.", "\u201cA good deal is still there to be done,\" Johnson insisted. But he told lawmakers in the House of Commons that the bloc's demands that the U.K. continue to adhere to its standards or face retaliation were not \"terms that any prime minister of this country should accept.\u201d", "German Chancellor Angela Merkel said \u201cthere is still the chance of an agreement,\u201d but stressed that the EU would not compromise on its core principles. Merkel told the German parliament that the bloc would \"take a path without an \u2026 agreement if there are conditions from the British side that we can\u2019t accept.\u201d", "The U.K. left the EU on Jan. 31 after 47 years of membership but remains within the bloc\u2019s tariff-free single market and customs union until the end of the year. Reaching a trade deal by then would ensure there are no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods on Jan. 1, although there would still be new costs and red tape for businesses.", "Failure to secure a trade deal would mean tariffs and other barriers that would hurt both sides, although most economists think the British economy would take a greater hit because the U.K. does almost half of its trade with the bloc.", "UK AGREES INTERIM TRADE DEAL WITH CANADA AMID BREXIT UNCERTAINTY", "Months of trade talks have failed to bridge the gaps on three issues \u2014 fishing rights, fair-competition rules, and the governance of future disputes.", "While both sides want a deal, they have fundamentally different views of what it entails. The EU fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards and pump state money into U.K. industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc\u2019s doorstep \u2014 hence the demand for strict \u201clevel playing field\u201d guarantees in exchange for access to its markets.", "Merkel said \u201cthe integrity of the single market must be preserved.\u201d", "\u201cWe must have a level playing field not just for today, but we must have one for tomorrow or the day after, and to do this we must have agreements on how one can react if the other changes their legal situation,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cOtherwise there ill be unfair competitive conditions that we cannot ask of our companies.\u201d", "The U.K. government sees Brexit as about sovereignty and \u201ctaking back control\u201d of the country\u2019s laws, borders and waters.
