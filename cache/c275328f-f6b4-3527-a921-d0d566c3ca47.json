Since it hit Xbox Game Preview back in July, the team has added new areas to explore in the backyard, a new zipline travel, and a fearsome encounter against a (comparatively) massive crow. Its latest update is the biggest one yet, adding a koi pond and its fearsome fishy resident. Players who choose to explore the pond\u2019s depths do so at their own peril, thanks to its patrolling koi and, unfortunately, the new diving-bell spider.", "\u201cThe koi pond was designed in November of last year, so that\u2019s how far in advance we were prepping this,\u201d says game director Adam Brennecke. \u201cWe always knew we wanted a koi pond. We were designing and discussing what we could do with this area and make it cool. We made a big list of how many creatures could exist in this area, and one of them was the diving-bell spider.\u201d That real-life creature has a remarkable habit of securing air bubbles so that it can breathe while hunting for prey underwater. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Yep, that one\u2019s on the list,\u2019 just because we knew, even at that stage, how cool spiders were in the game and how scary they were, and we just wanted to expand on that.\u201d", "The koi itself isn\u2019t exactly something that glides around a beautiful suburban water feature. For one, the pond, like the rest of Grounded\u2019s back-yard setting, has entered into a state of neglect. The water is murky and foul-looking, which makes it easy to get surprised by any number of water-based critters. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen those koi fish that are the big badasses in the pond, and they look so gnarly, like they\u2019ve been there forever,\u201d Brennecke says. \u201cThey\u2019re all scraped up. That\u2019s what we wanted to get across; this thing\u2019s been here for a long time, and it basically owns this area. This is the koi\u2019s turf. This creature owns this area, and you\u2019re just a little speck in it.\u201d", "The big fish isn't outright hostile to you, but it will become aggressive if you get too close or approach certain areas within the pond. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll find one of those spots as you explore, along with several other points of interest. An underwater lab provides some tantalizing new narrative details, and your tiny character can find objects like toy dinosaurs and quarters in and around the pond.", "Brennecke says this is the biggest update that Grounded has received so far, but that the team isn\u2019t about to stop thinking of ways to improve its survival game. Combat is getting some tuning, after early feedback indicated that element of the game was too static. \u201cWe took a step back and we looked at a lot of games with combat that we liked and analyzed them in depth, and one thing we found was we felt like we didn\u2019t have enough creature attacks,\u201d he says. \u201cThe spider, for example, had three attacks. What if we added three more variations? What would that do? That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re doing right now with all of our creatures.\u201d", "The team is also looking at the concept of pets, and how they might fit into Grounded\u2019s world. \u201cWe want to have the pet aphid, for example, where you can have that aphid and it follows you around and you can name it,\u201d Brennecke says. \u201cThese are all just ideas right now on paper. I think that\u2019s something where we really want to have that experience of having something that you can take care of. I think that\u2019s the goal of that.\u201d", "They\u2019re not pets, per se, but Brennecke says his team is trying to find ways that players could interact with the game\u2019s ants in more interesting ways. \u201cI think that\u2019s a really cool thing that we want to explore, of having ways of making ants be controlled by the player and you can have the ants do certain things. \u2026 I think once the player can interact with that layer of the A.I., I think there are going to be a lot of cool opportunities for us as game developers but I think the players will enjoy that, too.\u201d", "Brennecke says his team has grown to add a couple of engineers to help with incorporating the Xbox Series X/S. Those new consoles are shrinking load times and also enhancing the overall framerate and gameplay responsiveness. Those hires aside, Brennecke says he wants to maintain the small size of his team. \u201cOverall, the team is the same size and we\u2019re going to continue to make cool stuff. We have tons of ideas, and we just hope we have enough time to get those features in and make them shine.\u201d"], "authors": ["Senior Editor", "Jeff Has Spent Countless Hours Using His Thumbs To Maneuver Images On Television Screens."], "keywords": ["koi", "grounded", "yard", "team", "thats", "pond", "ways", "brennecke", "think", "thought", "preview", "explore", "cool", "safe", "game"], "pubDate": "2020-10-26T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7abf5426-5048-31ce-9c0a-822c58b19b47"}
