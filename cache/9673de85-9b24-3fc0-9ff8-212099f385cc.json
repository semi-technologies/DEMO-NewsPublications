If we have pepperoni or pizza with any type of meat or spice, some great pairings would be with Nebbiolo or Sangiovese because of their raspberries, cherries, dried fruit and leather notes, as well as higher tannins that can hold their own when up against that type of food.\u201d", "-Marija Mijic, sommelier and beverage director at La Mercerie", "Sparkling wine. \u201cSparkling wine is a great style to have in the fridge because it pairs excellently with many takeout options.

It has a little fizz to cut through the melty cheese plus a savory side for the tomato, spices, and pepperoni.
