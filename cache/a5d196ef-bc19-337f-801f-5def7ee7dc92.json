Earlier that year Yang Guansan had sent the results of China\u2019s first public-opinion surveys to Zhao Ziyang, then the Communist Party\u2019s chief. To Mr Yang, they suggested that unrest was imminent. After Zhao was purged for opposing the use of troops to crush the demonstrations, investigators discovered Mr Yang\u2019s submission. Found guilty of inciting the protests, the researcher was locked up for two years.", "For decades the party had scorned opinion polls as bourgeois and unnecessary\u2014it embodied the will of the Chinese people, so why ask them what they thought? But it has become more open to pulse-taking since Mr Yang\u2019s ordeal, which was described in an article by Tang Wenfang of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, published in 2018. Mr Yang says the party is \u201cmore paranoid\u201d about public opinion than its democratic peers because it lacks elections or a free press for feedback. Now ministries and official media have their own polling units. Universities run state-funded social surveys.", "In the internet age the party has been trying to gauge popular feeling in real time. Tech giants and consultancies such as Womin Technology offer help. In a report circulated online, apparently sent to the \u201ccentral authorities\u201d in February, Womin gave advice on how to handle swelling anger online over the death of a whistle-blowing doctor from covid-19. It suggested that recognising the doctor\u2019s contribution and blocking information put out by \u201cforeign forces\u201d would restore calm. (Perhaps coincidentally, that was the tactic adopted.)", "But social-media chatter can be hard to interpret, in part because the government\u2019s own censors work hard at suppressing subversive comments and injecting pro-party ones. Netizens often use coded messages, self-censor, or avoid posting on sensitive topics. Hu Yong of Peking University has identified two types of online public opinion in China: popular sentiment and views crafted or given prominence by the state. It is often hard to tell the genres apart.", "In a crisis, while officials are still unsure what line to impose, the job can be a little easier. \u201cIf you act fast, you can get good results,\u201d says Mr Tang, noting a brief period of openness on the Chinese web early in the covid-19 epidemic. Sometimes critical opinions on public health, the environment and even official corruption are left uncensored, providing they do not support collective action. But views expressed online offer only a partial picture. It is mainly young, urban and tech-savvy Chinese who use social media."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["zhao", "academics", "online", "mr", "apparatchiks", "14bnpeople", "yang", "public", "chinas", "party", "chinese", "struggle", "opinion", "question", "pulse", "hard", "alike", "yangs"], "pubDate": "2020-10-24T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
