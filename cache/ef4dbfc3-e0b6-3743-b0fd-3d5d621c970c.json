OK, that\u2019s not the most perfect analogy. Florida\u2019s tiny-paper-fragment mess was part of a massive recount that eventually landed in the Supreme Court; Nevada is just taking a while to count votes. Forgive me. It\u2019s been a long week, and I just really liked the almost-rhyme between \u201cchad\u201d and \u201cNevada.\u201d This is where we\u2019re at in the election cycle.", "Anyway, here\u2019s the deal: Election Night in America has now spread her wings and expanded into Election Week in America, and as of Thursday, there were still many states where the vote was too close to call for either President Trump or former vice president Joe Biden. Those included Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and, yes, Nevada. But while many of them seemed to be moving along at a steady clip and reporting their vote totals as they went, Nevada, well, wasn\u2019t. (As of this writing, the state still only has about 89 percent of its ballots counted.) Left with little else to do but wait, the internet did what it always does: started a meme.", "Across Twitter, Tumblr, and TikTok\u2014any social media site that begins with the letter T, basically\u2014users began comparing Nevada to all manner of late and/or slow things: the sloth in Zootopia, really shitty friends who never meet you when they say they will, menstrual periods eight to nine months before child birth. OK, that last one is fake, but you get the drift. (Also, this meme has been going on for days. Someone might\u2019ve already made that joke and I missed it.) Other memes referenced Titanic, SpongeBob SquarePants, and the Brian McKnight jam \u201cBack at One,\u201d because the whole chorus is just very slow counting. It felt a little brutal, but Nevada is the Battle Born State\u2014it can take it.", "And all the jokes landed. Not because they were all undeniably brilliant. In fact, many were fairly by-the-book meme constructions. But it\u2019s easy to see why they went viral. Not since that 2000 election has any presidential race been this much of a prolonged nail-biter. It\u2019s like if the best-of-seven NBA playoffs got crammed into four consecutive days. Each night America went to bed feeling like the race was a little closer to completion, but at any point, the lead could change. The next four years of American politics will be determined by this election, and one of the things that could tip the scale are a few thousand ballots in Nevada. (Though, at the time of publication Friday morning, it looks like Pennsylvania will be the deciding commonwealth.) All anyone can do is wait for the votes to be counted, while staring at the internet (or a TV). Memes, at least, break the tension.", "On Wednesday, I wrote a piece about the agony of watching the election play out online, rather than amongst friends or family. Watching historical moments happen and only being able to share them digitally kinda sucks. But spreading Covid-19 sucks even more, so people stayed home, away from each other. In the days since states started tallying their votes, the anxiety has only gotten worse. But every so often someone jumped on social media to dunk on a state just trying to count their ballots. It isn\u2019t nice, but it still feels good.", "More Great WIRED Stories"], "authors": ["Angela Watercutter", "Angela Watercutte", "Brian Barrett", "Kate Knibbs"], "keywords": ["votes", "dunking", "america", "went", "internet", "week", "days", "ballots", "nevada", "election", "little", "memes", "wired"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
