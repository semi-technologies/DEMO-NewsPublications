Daphne defended the E.U.\u2019s asylum law, as her countrymen advocated sinking the boats at sea. The phrase \u201cDaphne sucks black cock\u201d appeared in spray paint on a wall in Bidnija. Then the arson attacks began\u2014on a human-rights lawyer\u2019s car and on the cars of people who worked for a Jesuit refugee service. One of the Caruana Galizias\u2019 dogs disappeared. Another was shot. Paul, who was in high school, returned home late one night to find that a group of men had tried to burn down the house. They had stacked Molotov cocktails in tires and set them alight against glass patio doors overlooking the valley.", "Daphne\u2019s sons attended university in Malta, then moved away. Matthew developed news apps for the Financial Times, then followed a girlfriend to Costa Rica, where he built Web sites for investigative-reporting outlets. Andrew joined Malta\u2019s foreign service, and worked in embassies in Berlin and New Delhi. Paul moved to London and pursued a Ph.D. in economics.", "Daphne\u2019s world grew smaller, madder, more constricting. In a country that was ninety-five per cent Catholic and hadn\u2019t legalized divorce, she wrote that she\u2019d rather sip prosecco than go to church on Easter Sunday. \u201cThe harassment changes with technology,\u201d she noted, shortly before her death. Fewer ranting phone calls to the house, fewer envelopes filled with shit. An old man sent typewritten letters, which Daphne shared with the boys: \u201cI used to tell them, \u2018Look, the crazy old man wrote again.\u2019 And eventually he must have died, because they stopped.\u201d", "As the threats shifted online, devoted readers tried to help. A breeder of Neapolitan mastiffs gave her a new guard dog. But an aging bandit who lived nearby said that the dog was too easily won over with treats. \u201cSignora, you need a goose,\u201d he advised.", "One day in March, 2008, when Matthew was in Bidnija, Daphne decided to set up a blog. She had grown frustrated with the editorial constraints at the local paper, so Matthew helped her create a WordPress site. Her first post, \u201cZero Tolerance for Corruption,\u201d was a critique of the Labour Party leader which ran close to four thousand words. The post drew so much attention that the server crashed. Six days later, Malta held its general election. Labour lost.", "Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Roz Chast", "Later that year, Joseph Muscat ascended to the role of Labour leader\u2014a move that placed him back in Daphne\u2019s crosshairs. He had reacted to Malta\u2019s E.U. accession by reversing his position and becoming one of the Labour Party\u2019s representatives to the European Parliament. Daphne vilified him, for this and other fumbles, in an increasingly vituperative tone. In his first month as Labour leader, she described him as a \u201ccocky shrimp\u201d who was \u201calready proving that his party has promoted him beyond his abilities.\u201d He was, she wrote, a \u201cquintessential empty vessel,\u201d his voice a \u201cnasal whine, which makes him sound like a twerp protesting that he\u2019s been waiting too long in the queue at a nightclub for a vodka-cranberry juice.\u201d Muscat\u2019s supporters were \u201csub-literate,\u201d his wife\u2019s behavior like that of \u201cthe worst sort of vulgar, common and pushy person,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd his aides\u2014oh dear, his aides\u2014don\u2019t really have that much going on upstairs.\u201d The Labour Party portrayed her as a partisan hack. But her attacks were indiscriminate; she once dedicated a post to her sudden realization that Muscat\u2019s opponent\u2014whom she also despised\u2014bore a \u201ctruly astonishing resemblance\u201d to a beluga whale.", "Muscat set about trying to modernize the Party platform by making it socially liberal and Eurocentric, and in the next few years he won over many of Malta\u2019s youth. He campaigned in favor of bringing women into the workforce and legalizing divorce, and\u2014after a divorce bill narrowly passed, in 2011\u2014he voiced support for gay rights.", "In 2013, Muscat ran for Prime Minister on a pledge to reduce energy costs by at least twenty-five per cent, through the construction of a new power station near the island\u2019s southern harbor. Malta\u2019s electricity came from heavy fuel oil. Muscat\u2019s proposed station would run on liquid natural gas, which is cheaper and cleaner. At a campaign event, a woman who lived near the old power station told him that her husband had died of cancer, and that eight of her grandchildren were asthmatic. \u201cShe brought tears to my eyes,\u201d Muscat told the press. \u201cUnder my watch, I will close this cancer-and-asthma factory. We have to save these people. I don\u2019t want to hear of one child who gets sick.\u201d", "By then, Daphne\u2019s blog was getting more than half a million visitors each day\u2014more than the population of Malta. The night before the election, a homicide detective named Keith Arnaud was sent to arrest Daphne at home. Under Maltese law, news outlets were prohibited from publishing election-related content within twenty-four hours of a vote, and Daphne had just mocked Muscat on her blog. Upon her release, she told reporters, \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to be in an E.U. member state and have the police investigating and interrogating people for writing about politics on the Internet.\u201d", "The next morning, Labour won the election by the widest margin in post-colonial Maltese history, and Muscat became Prime Minister. He was thirty-nine.", "In early 2016, Matthew was living in Berlin, working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on an unprecedented data leak. Someone with access to the e-mail servers at Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian legal firm, had turned over to reporters more than eleven million documents exposing the inner workings of the global offshore financial system. The resulting investigations of the documents, known as the Panama Papers, triggered protests and money-laundering inquiries on six continents. \u201cThis is how most money in the world is stored, and how it flows,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cOffshore banking, offshore shell companies, offshore accountancy firms. Underground rivers. When you see a bank branch on the side of the road, what you\u2019re looking at is really just the hair on the top of the head.\u201d Under Muscat\u2019s leadership, Malta had become an epicenter of such activity, drawing in vast sums of foreign money while turning a blind eye to its provenance.", "The I.C.I.J. partnered with more than a hundred journalists from eighty countries to sort through the information. But Matthew, who reviewed the files after he was hired to build the Web site for the project, advised the consortium against sharing documents with Maltese reporters. \u201cI identified very early on that the managing director of the Times of Malta was in a criminal relationship with Keith Schembri,\u201d Muscat\u2019s chief of staff, he told me. \u201cIt was a classic kickback scheme.\u201d Schembri, who owned a printing-and-paper company, overcharged the Times for services, and directed a portion of the profits to a shell company owned by the newspaper\u2019s managing director. (The director, who resigned soon afterward, denies any wrongdoing.)", "Matthew called his mother and told her that he had discovered in the data that Schembri had a shell company of his own. So did Muscat\u2019s energy minister, Konrad Mizzi, who was now in charge of the power-station project that had been central to the Labour Party\u2019s campaign. A Maltese accountant had begun setting up the companies in Panama five days after Muscat won.", "Daphne had felt for years that the power station made no sense. The previous government had approved the construction of an undersea cable to Sicily, which now connected Malta directly to the European power grid. Muscat\u2019s power station, she thought, was superfluous, costly, and unreliable\u2014and was likely set up as a kind of cover for distributing taxpayer funds to political allies and friends. \u201cIn Malta we take it for granted that people and businesses finance political parties so as to have their \u2018stooge\u2019 in government and get a return on their investment,\u201d she had written a few months after the election. \u201cElsewhere, this is called corruption.\u201d", "Matthew asked his mother to remain quiet until April, when the I.C.I.J. planned to release the Panama Papers. But, in early February, after a tense encounter with Mizzi, the energy minister, she posted a cryptic note about members of the Labour Party wearing Panama hats. A leak turned into a flood of new tips. Then the dam began to break.", "There were trusts in New Zealand, companies in the British Virgin Islands, projects in Montenegro, secret accounts in Shanghai and Dubai belonging to members of the Maltese \u00e9lite. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Russian doll\u2014you open the one on top and there\u2019s another one underneath,\u201d Matthew told me.", "A third shell company, Egrant, was established at the same time as those owned by the men in Muscat\u2019s Cabinet. But the accountant had taken special care to hide the identity of Egrant\u2019s owner. In the accountant\u2019s e-mail correspondence with his Panamanian counterparts\u2014in which Schembri and Mizzi are identified by name\u2014he said that he could reveal the name of the person who owned Egrant only via an encrypted call.", "\u201cHow unbelievably corrupt they are,\u201d Daphne wrote. \u201cAnd worse still, they were not tempted into corruption when they were already jaded in power, but actually got into power with the express purpose of being corrupt.\u201d In a parliamentary declaration filed shortly after Mizzi took office, he had overreported his Maltese bank balance by a quarter of a million euros, as if to pre\u00ebmpt questions once the funds actually arrived. (Mizzi denies any financial misdeeds.)", "With globalization, the country had become an attractive entry point to the European Union for dirty money. \u201cIf you allow a bank that\u2019s operating as a laundromat to set up in Malta, it\u2019s as good as setting it up in Germany or France,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOnce illicit money crosses that border, that\u2019s it\u2014it\u2019s in.\u201d An Iranian bank owner apparently laundered funds and violated international sanctions through his branch in Valletta; Russian oligarchs bought Maltese passports, under an investment scheme launched by Muscat\u2019s government. Muscat travelled to \u201ccitizenship seminars\u201d in Beirut and Dubai to hawk passports.", "In speeches, Muscat recited the Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, which begins, \u201cLord, make me an instrument of your peace.\u201d Daphne published her own version. \u201cHenley, make me an instrument of your passport sales,\u201d she wrote, referring to a global citizenship firm. \u201cWhere there is despair, let me profit from it; where there is darkness, let me give it a banking licence.\u201d", "The successive scandals had little effect on Muscat\u2019s popularity. He stood by Schembri and Mizzi, and dismissed questions about the ownership of Egrant. When a local reporter asked Muscat if Malta\u2019s reputation was being tarnished by the findings in the Panama Papers, he replied that, if anything, Malta\u2019s reputation was being tarnished from Bidnija.", "For almost a year, Daphne voiced her suspicions that Egrant belonged to Muscat. Then a whistle-blower from a bank told Daphne that Egrant belonged to Muscat\u2019s wife, Michelle. Soon afterward, the whistle-blower fled to Greece. The lead investigator at Malta\u2019s Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit told his bosses that he could find out who owned Egrant within seventy-two hours, if he was given access to the right tax returns, bank statements, and Labour Party files. The next morning, he was fired. Meanwhile, Malta\u2019s attorney general discouraged the police from investigating any matters originating from the Panama Papers. (An independent review by a Maltese magistrate found no evidence linking the Muscats to Egrant\u2014but was also unable to identify the owner.)", "\u201cOne of the effects of Muscat kind of eating away at our institutions was that it sent people to my mother,\u201d Paul said. Bureaucrats whose internal reports ought to have triggered police investigations saw them quashed instead. So they leaked to Daphne, transforming her from a columnist into the island\u2019s most prolific investigative reporter. She didn\u2019t always nail the details, but she was uniquely unafraid.", "The Labour Party erected billboards with Daphne\u2019s face on them. \u201cPeople began to recognize me who had never recognized me before,\u201d Daphne wrote. \u201cThey pulled down their car windows to shout abuse.\u201d On the Party\u2019s TV station, Glenn Bedingfield, a government official and a close friend of Muscat\u2019s, hosted a show that regularly portrayed Daphne as a deranged, cackling witch, with a hooked nose and warts, taking swigs from a whiskey bottle as she typed up batty screeds. Bedingfield also started a blog, posting from the Office of the Prime Minister. He published photos of Daphne sent in by the public, making her life on the island intolerable. He wrote about her more than a thousand times. \u201cIt was like being in prison,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe last time she went to the beach, people took pictures of her and doctored the photos so that her thighs were larger, her arms were flabbier.\u201d Daphne\u2019s friends were harassed. When she found a caf\u00e9 where people left her alone, it was raided by the police, under the guise of an audit. The officers smashed glasses and threw around furniture.", "A memorial to Daphne, in front of a monument to Faith, Fortitude, and Civilization.

Around that time, he said, an increasing number of inquiries at the Embassy in New Delhi had been about buying Maltese passports. \u201cIt was humiliating\u2014Malta was becoming an embarrassment,\u201d he said."], "authors": ["Ben Taub", "Ben Tau"], "keywords": ["malta", "told", "maltese", "muscat", "labour", "wrote", "muscats", "daphne", "murder", "maltas", "power"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
