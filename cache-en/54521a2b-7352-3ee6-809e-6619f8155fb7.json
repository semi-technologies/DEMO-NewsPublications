Rock-sized pieces of regolith were bulging the head\u2019s Mylar flap ring partially open in several places. The flap was meant to allow material in\u2014but not out. Nothing like this had happened during testing, which had included simulations of near-zero-G conditions using regolith-like materials, says Beau Bierhaus, Lockheed Martin\u2019s Tagsam lead scientist. The particles appearing to hold the flap open were the right size and shape for collection. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that would have prevented the particles from being collected [inside the Tagsam head], other than there was no more room left at the inn,\u201d Bierhaus says. \u201cBecause there was no more room inside, it got stuck.\u201d", "How might the Tagsam head have become so full? Because Bennu\u2019s surface was a mystery to scientists before OSIRIS-REx arrived to scope it up close, Bierhaus and other Lockheed engineers had to design their collector head to bounce off and suction up a range of surface types, from ones similar to a hard-packed gravel driveway to ones softer than a fine, sandy beach. Before the team saw Bennu up close, they modeled its surface based on the 25103 Itokawa asteroid, sampled in 2005 by the first Japanese Hayabusa mission. \u201cWe were hoping to, in essence, scoop up a big bucket of soft sand,\u201d says Ed Beshore, the former deputy principal investigator of the mission, now retired from the University of Arizona. Instead, pictures of Bennu\u2019s surface taken by OSIRIS-REx\u2019s cameras before the touch-and-go appeared to show a minefield of sharp boulders and rocks.", "But Bennu had more surprises in store. In fact, based on the Tagsam\u2019s deep bounce, it seems the surface material was not hard. In the asteroid\u2019s microgravity environment, it instead behaved like a viscous fluid\u2014thousands of marbles bouncing and scattering in low gravity. \u201cIf you push into it, it displaces and moves in ways we could not have anticipated,\u201d Bierhaus says.", "The head penetrated the first few centimeters of surface without much resistance. This, Moreau says, \u201cpreloaded the center of the Tagsam head with material, and then when the gas blew, all that stuff went into the head immediately.\u201d As the arm continued downward another half meter through the yielding surface, more regolith might have been jammed in. \u201cBy the time we backed away, the head would\u2019ve been packed full,\u201d he continues. Another possibility, given the surprisingly viscous surface material, is that the regolith\u2019s soft, malleable rocks wedged into the Mylar flap opening and weren\u2019t able to make it all the way into the head, Moreau says.", "Still, at HQ, there was some good news. Twenty to 30 minutes after the spacecraft stopped moving its Tagsam arm, the leak of material appeared to have died down. \u201cEvery time we moved the arm, we were shaking stuff loose,\u201d Moreau says. Now the team ordered the ship to quiet itself, point toward Earth for easy communication, and \u201cpark\u201d its arm in place. The team also canceled the upcoming sample mass measurement maneuver, which required extending the Tagsam arm and spinning the spacecraft\u2014an action that was likely to spray debris out of the head in 360 degrees.", "Confident the Tagsam had gagged up only a portion of its enormous bite, the team moved on to the next question: Assuming the head had been crammed full of material when it bounced off Bennu, and that the leakage had been caused largely by movement of the arm, how much of the sample had been lost? Were there at least 60 grams left to stow away?", "To answer those questions without the measurement maneuver, five teams set about making estimates using alternate techniques. One group analyzed high-resolution imagery of the landing zone, down to the individual rocks, to model how many grams should have been collected; they estimated it was likely hundreds. Another group pored over photos of the Tagsam after the touch and go, peering into its visible area (about 40 percent of the container) to estimate the volume of the debris inside. The obstruction of light seen in a screen ringing the outside of the container offered another clue that the capsule might be close to full. One team estimated that the rocky material jammed in the Mylar flap was in the tens of grams\u2014not enough to make up the necessary sample on its own, but a sizable prize. Another team used new 3D imaging techniques to estimate the size and mass of hundreds of particles shown escaping during the 10-minute imaging session just after the movement of the Tagsam arm, and found loss in the tens of grams\u2014a \u201cdecent amount,\u201d says Coralie Adam, the mission\u2019s lead optical navigation engineer, but \u201cwe probably lost the smallest material that could escape through those gaps.\u201d"], "authors": ["Chris Wright", "Chris Wrigh"], "keywords": ["nasa", "tagsam", "surface", "bierhaus", "team", "head", "flap", "arm", "particles", "leaky", "material", "sample", "osirisrex", "scrambled", "save", "disaster"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
