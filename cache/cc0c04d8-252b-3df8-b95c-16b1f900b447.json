That means it is also two months since the Indian authorities detained some 2,000 prominent Kashmiris\u2014politicians, businessmen, activists, journalists\u2014to prevent them from protesting. They continue to be held without charge, many in unknown places. Meanwhile the 7m-odd residents of the Kashmir valley, the state\u2019s main population centre, are under a lockdown of a different sort. Mobile phones and the internet remain cut off; getting around is hard and getting in or out is possible only on the authorities\u2019 say-so. In theory the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is integrating Kashmir into the rest of India. In practice it has turned the valley into a vast open-air detention centre.", "That the BJP has it in for Kashmiris is hardly news. The manifesto the party put out before it won its thumping victory in national elections earlier this year called for the scrapping of Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s special status. The state is the only one in India with a Muslim majority, and the Hindu-nationalist BJP dislikes anything that smacks of privileges for Muslims. The BJP also likes to parade its defiance of Pakistan, which controls a slice of Kashmir and claims the rest, and has vehemently denounced the upheaval in the valley. For Narendra Modi, the prime minister and leader of the BJP , picking on Kashmir presents an easy opportunity to pose as a resolute nationalist who will not hesitate to confront his enemies.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "But if Mr Modi\u2019s actions are not that surprising, the reaction of the courts has been (see article). India\u2019s judges are notoriously meddlesome and difficult. No question is beneath their scrutiny: what destinations state-owned airlines should fly to, say, or just how close a liquor store can be to a highway. They have dealt all sorts of embarrassing defeats to the central government in recent years, inventing a previously unknown right to privacy that almost scuppered a huge biometric identification scheme, and voiding a lucrative auction of mobile-telephone licences. Yet on the many glaring abuses occurring in Kashmir they have remained resolutely\u2014and shamefully\u2014silent.", "Although the courts in Kashmir are in theory functioning, lawyers are striking, making it hard for petitioners to get anywhere. The chief justice of the Supreme Court in Delhi has declared that he is simply too busy to hear all the cases related to the government\u2019s actions in Kashmir. He passed them to other benches of the Supreme Court, one of which gave the government a further month to contemplate its response. Conveniently enough, that pushes any ruling about whether or not the government\u2019s downgrading of Jammu & Kashmir from a state to a territory was constitutional until after the change takes effect, on October 31st. It will also mean, in all likelihood, a further month of detention without trial for the Kashmiris rounded up by the authorities and another month during which humbler Kashmiris will be deprived of rights that other Indians take for granted.", "Few of those other Indians will care very much. The Kashmir valley is hemmed in by the Himalayas at the northern extreme of the country, far from most Indians\u2019 thoughts and experience. It has been in some degree of turmoil since partition and independence 72 years ago. It suffers separatist violence, now mostly home-grown rather than instigated by Pakistan, which demands a response from India\u2019s security services\u2014though that does not justify today\u2019s wholesale lockdown. To the extent that the rest of the country gives Kashmiris any thought, it tends to see them as troublemakers, if not traitors. Many Indians are toasting Mr Modi for at last giving them their comeuppance."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/05/the-courts-refusal-to-curb-repression-in-kashmir", "title": "The courts\u2019 refusal to curb repression in Kashmir", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["indians", "indias", "month", "bjp", "repression", "rest", "refusal", "valley", "curb", "kashmiris", "kashmir", "state", "jammu", "courts"]}
