The man responsible for Brexit, who was visiting America to support his friend\u2019s campaign, has announced that he will be launching a new political party, Reform UK , to contest local elections next spring. It will advocate letting covid-19 circulate freely among the young and healthy, while the old and vulnerable shield themselves.", "The Tory party once dismissed Mr Farage\u2019s followers as a gaggle of golf-club bores and pub cranks. The problem for Boris Johnson is that, once again, Britain\u2019s club houses and bars are closed, and a growing slice of their Conservative-voting patrons are unhappy about it. On November 5th, the government instigated a second national lockdown, which will be in place until at least December 2nd.", "Mr Johnson had vowed to avoid that at all costs, and had wanted to pursue a series of tiered regional restrictions. He changed course on October 31st, after the government\u2019s scientists warned that on its current trajectory the disease would kill up to 4,000 people a day in the week before Christmas. That, Mr Johnson said, would be a \u201cmoral and medical disaster\u201d, which would see hospitals filled and doctors choosing whom to save.", "Ministers scoff at Mr Farage\u2019s many comebacks. He is \u201clike Frank Sinatra\u201d, says one. But he is hard to ignore, for he has traumatised and transformed the Conservative Party in the past decade. First, as leader of the UK Independence Party, he turbocharged the question of EU membership by fusing it to immigration, and compelled David Cameron to hold the 2016 referendum. Then, as Theresa May\u2019s exit treaty became stuck in Parliament, he launched the Brexit Party, which swiftly overtook the Tories in the polls, prompting them to dump her and her deal. His method is to harass the party through local and European elections, thus panicking the leadership into adopting his policies.", "Mr Johnson was chosen to replace Mrs May because Tories believed that only he could suppress Mr Farage and unite the party under the Brexit banner. The Tory village has been rebuilt as a citadel against future assaults. Europhiles and fiscal disciplinarians were given the boot. Its mission is to deliver Brexit, and to hold together the coalition that Mr Johnson built. Yet Mr Farage can spy cracks in the fortress walls.", "On November 4th, 34 Tories voted against the new restrictions. They abhor the lockdown as a violation of civil liberties, a destroyer of jobs and a humiliating reversal. Ministers fear that in future they will need Labour support to pass covid-19 rules\u2014a sign of impotence that last year\u2019s election victory was meant to banish.", "The splits on covid-19 are shallower and less treacherous than on Europe, which afflicted the party for three decades. But they run along similar lines. The lockdown critics include Iain Duncan Smith and Steve Baker, leading Brexiteers. Mr Farage will get enthusiastic support from the Daily Telegraph, a Brexity newspaper, and the right-wing commentariat. Each side has its favoured scientists. The polarisation makes it increasingly hard to forge a national consensus on epidemiology, just as it was on European trade policy.", "Lockdown scepticism is a minority pursuit, but growing: support has fallen from 93% of voters in March to 72% now. The low-trust, anti-immigration voters who flitted between Mr Farage and Mr Johnson are the \u201cshakiest wing\u201d of the Tory coalition, says Rob Ford, a political scientist and co-author with Maria Sobolewska of \u201cBrexitland\u201d, a new book. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much for them to be out the door.\u201d The government\u2019s net approval rating among Leave voters stands at -3%, compared with 67% in March. A growing share of Leavers say the prime minister is weak rather than strong, according to YouGov, a pollster. Most significantly, Mr Johnson\u2019s vote is spongy at the edges. The proportion of people who voted Tory in 2019 who are now either undecided or wouldn\u2019t vote at all is up from 8% in January to 18% now. For Labour voters the figure has fallen one point to 12%.", "This is fertile terrain for Mr Farage, who undermines Mr Johnson\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre. The prime minister\u2019s appeal to his party lay in his ability to match Mr Farage\u2019s beery charm. He is now mirthless, and deeply reliant on the Whitehall expertocracy he once mocked. \u201cBoris and his people want us all to hide behind the sofa,\u201d says Richard Tice, chairman of Reform UK . The damage may last even if a vaccine curbs the pandemic soon, for rebellion is habit-forming.", "Mr Farage\u2019s return will sharpen the Conservatives\u2019 instinct to prioritise holding its Brexit coalition together over pursuing new voters. But the task will get harder. Since 2015, the Tories have told Mr Farage\u2019s followers that while they might like the cut of his jib, only they can deliver a referendum on Europe, or an exit deal. A Labour Party with a hard-left leader was a useful bogey. But Brexit is nearly done, and Sir Keir Starmer does not frighten the horses.", "How is Mr Johnson to bind his coalition? One answer is money. The government will launch an infrastructure spree in its new northern constituencies. Another is the threat of a Scottish independence referendum, which Mr Johnson will oppose. It will also double down on cultural issues; ministers think a row over the singing of patriotic songs at the Proms music festival resonated with their base. Many Conservatives will conclude from Mr Trump\u2019s better-than-expected performance that a disastrous response to covid-19 can be overcome by whipping up angry identity politics, says Mr Ford.", "Yet that approach is fraught with risks. It may push the liberal wing of the Tory coalition towards the soothing Sir Keir. Continental Europe\u2019s experience suggests that aping the rhetoric of the radical right fans its flames rather than dousing them, reckons Tim Bale, a political scientist. Mr Johnson may eventually succeed in managing the pandemic. But a prime minister can never match Mr Farage as a crusading outsider, nor as the toast of the golf club. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["farage", "torment", "mr", "tory", "returns", "tories", "conservative", "party", "coalition", "whos", "brexit", "nigel", "farages", "johnson", "voters", "look"], "pubDate": "2020-11-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
