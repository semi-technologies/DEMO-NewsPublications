Many are youngsters themselves, ready to dispense friendly advice about buffing up CV s. So far the documents passed to them have been uninspiring. One reckons candidates would fare better if their schooling had taught them more practical skills, such as how to craft a job application. Employers are also looking for fluent English-speakers, he notes.", "Malaysian youths are in need of such advice. The overall unemployment rate is around 3%, but among those aged 15-24 it is over 10%. Young people frequently relocate in the hunt for a job. \u201cThe number one export of Perak isn\u2019t pomelos or rice, it\u2019s talent,\u201d laments Howard Lee, a young politician from the relatively sleepy, fast-ageing state. The Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia estimates that perhaps half of youngsters in rural states leave for the bright lights of big cities.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "Moving is not a guarantee of employment, however. Even those who relocate are often short of work. According to the central bank, more than 173,000 holders of tertiary qualifications entered the workforce between 2010 and 2017. But fewer than 99,000 high-skilled jobs were created during the same period. A sales representative for a telemarketing firm in Kuala Lumpur, who moved there from Perak, complains that he has to work as a driver for a ride-hailing platform at weekends to make ends meet.", "The good news for young Malaysians is that their political clout is growing. In July the government lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. That change, combined with the relative youthfulness of Malaysia\u2019s population and the relatively lengthy period\u2014five years\u2014between elections, means that by the time of the next election, due to be held in 2023, almost 8m people will be eligible to vote for the first time. There were only 15m eligible voters at the most recent election, last year, so the new cohort will constitute well over a third of the electorate. Understanding their concerns will be essential for political success.", "This new cohort may prove a tricky bunch to please. Young people find politics comic, says one teenager. \u201cIt isn\u2019t taken seriously and that needs to change.\u201d An ambiguous survey conducted after last year\u2019s election by the Merdeka Centre, a polling outfit, gives an inkling of young voters\u2019 mixed feelings. Only about 65% of those aged between 21 and 30 thought the country was going in the right direction, but 92% were satisfied with the victory of Pakatan Harapan ( PH ), the coalition that is now in office.", "The government is trying to cater to the concerns of the young. Saddiq Abdul Rahman, the minister of youth and sports, who is in his twenties himself, championed the lowering of the voting age. He has also pushed to raise the minimum monthly wage for interns from 300 ringgit ($72) to 900 ringgit and to streamline the provision of vocational training to youngsters (no fewer than six ministries are currently involved). \u201cIf we fail to deliver on the basic needs of the young populace then you\u2019re bound to create a vacuum which will be filled by demagogues,\u201d he argues."], "pubDate": null}
