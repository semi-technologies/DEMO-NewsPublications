It's like trying to steer the Titanic and so without knowledge and with uncertainty and with a business model that's worked for 60 years or more, it is a slow process,\u201d Owen Sloane, a Los Angeles-based entertainment and media lawyer and partner at Eisner LLP, told Fox Business.", "\u201cAnd that obviously left open all of the growth and the market share that Netflix and Amazon and all the other streaming services have,\" he added.", "Sloane believes that a number of respected companies have overleveraged themselves in recent months and years due to big spending and fears they won\u2019t be able to recoup losses because streaming is a subscription-based business, so finding other ways of driving revenue is paramount.", "HALLE BERRY\u2019S MMA FILM \u2018BRUISED\u2019 SCORES KNOCKOUT WITH NETFLIX IN HUGE DEAL: REPORT", "The new business model overtaken by streaming has caused a shift in the overall needs of a network or streaming entity in today\u2019s climate.", "Ticker Security Last Change Change % NFLX NETFLIX INC. 499.20 +5.60 +1.13% AMZN AMAZON.COM INC. 3,103.97 -0.23 -0.01% CMCSA COMCAST CORP. 50.72 -0.54 -1.05% DISCA DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS INC. 28.56 +0.06 +0.21% SNE SONY CORPORATION 93.69 -0.48 -0.51% DIS WALT DISNEY COMPANY 154.19 -0.21 -0.14%", "For companies looking for a quick fix to bolster content reserves and ensure a business can continue to pump out material personalized for a wide and growing range of consumers, \u201cacquiring a company is an easier bet than to start with somebody new and try to build that same success from scratch,\u201d said Sloane.", "Major media conglomerates are not only competing for their share of a crowded streaming market, in which new platforms are being announced on a seemingly weekly basis, but they are tasked with creating more and more content in order to satisfy the palates of millions of paying streaming subscribers who can jump ship at any moment.", "Such a task \u201ccreates a bigger demand for product because you've got to satisfy this big monster that gobbles up content,\u201d said Sloane, \u201cBut some of it is shorter form. If you were doing a sitcom, you do it in steps but you could do it for three years, four years, and five years for a really successful sitcom. But that doesn't necessarily happen on a streaming service. It's maybe six episodes or eight episodes and maybe a few seasons and that's it.\u201d", "\u201cSo I think part of that is a conservative approach,\u201d the attorney continued. \u201cIt obviously depends on how much money they're spending but I think they're trying to gain not only a good product but also name value so as a subscriber business if you've got someone who creates hit shows, that really makes a big difference.\u201d", "NETFLIX REMOVES 'CHAPPELLE'S SHOW' FROM PLATFORM AFTER REQUEST FROM DAVE CHAPPELLE", "NBCUniversal recently launched its free streaming service, Peacock, in a move widely viewed as better late than never \u2013 and amid the pandemic the parent company to E! Entertainment has had to let hundreds of employees go.", "AMC Networks announced last month that it too, would cut around 10% of its U.S. workforce and despite Discovery Inc. making waves throughout the landscape with news their streaming service Discovery+ would launch in January 2021, a large number of their employees had also been handed their walking papers in 2020.", "Lionsgate and Sony Pictures Entertainment have also followed suit in letting some of their employees go. Sony saw a $230 million profit in the second quarter of 2020 but predicts 2021 will be \"crowded\" to say the least. Sony has also shelled out huge money to Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, Appian Way on a first-look deal in August.", "QUIBI CEO MEG WHITMAN CALLS LAUNCH \u201cSLIGHTLY BELOW\u201d PAR", "Meanwhile, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman\u2019s corporate-backed, short-form streaming service, Quibi, failed to make any movement and the plug was pulled on the mobile platform just six months after it launched. Katzenberg outright blamed the pandemic for Quibi\u2019s downfall as the concept was designed for subscribers to view its minuteslong video content while on the move \u2013 which the pandemic put a halt to as many were forced to stay inside.", "The service didn't do itself any favors by being mobile-only and it reportedly retained less than 10% of its free trial subscribers.", "Jerome Courshon, a film producer and leading distribution expert at Film Distribution Solutions, said the onslaught of network and media company layoffs represent a significant downturn in the film and television industries \u2013 at least in the short term.", "HOW THE KARDASHIANS\u2019 EXIT FROM E! COULD AFFECT THE NETWORK: EXPERTS", "\u201cEverybody has been trying to hold on and hoping that the pandemic would \u2013 I think a lot of people probably knew that Dr. [Anthony] Fauci would be correct, that we would have this massive wave this coming winter,\u201d said Courshon. \u201cBut I think there were also people hoping maybe it won't happen. Well, it has happened and it's been devastating. It is devastating not just to our personal lives in the film industry [but] it's devastating to everybody.\u201d", "Courshon echoed the sentiment from Sloane that \u201ctraditional industries are always slow to pivot and move.\u201d", "\u201cWe kind of know that and it just tends to be true,\u201d said Courshon. \u201cAnd certainly, when you look at the mid- to late-2000s, literally 10 to 15 years ago, only the independent players, the entrepreneurs and independent people were pushing streaming, other than Netflix \u2013 but they were independent at the time.\u201d", "Back in 2015, one of the largest streamers was the now-defunct PlayStation Vue, which initially launched in large markets only. What the market had was a litany of early-adopters and consumers who were moving forward in the direction of streaming and the result was a slow-as-molasses pace on part of studios that waited a long time to even begin thinking about trying to catch up to the new medium as their respective platforms simply didn\u2019t exist yet.", "KARDASHIANS COULD LAND STREAMING DEAL AFTER 'KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS' ENDS: REPORT", "\u201cHulu was a combination of three major companies and networks coming together, so really for whatever reason, it's just hard for huge companies and bureaucracies to really move and get ahead of any curve,\u201d Courshon explained. \u201cThey tend to be behind a little bit or a lot, it just ranges.\u201d", "The independent producer, who secured a Warner Bros. distribution deal on his first-ever indie film, said networks were also slow to embrace ad-supported video on demand (AVOD), and when factoring the availability of streaming subscriptions that utilize AVOD, it has become increasingly difficult for independent producers to make money with the collapse of DVD and Blu-ray disc \u2013 a format that was once lucrative for filmmakers.", "\u201cWith AVOD many companies are far behind and AVOD is becoming kind of the new leader in streaming because people already have several subscriptions,\u201d said Courshon. \u201cWe don't need or want ten subscriptions and a lot of people are still OK with watching movies with commercials. In rare instances, I'll pay the $3.99 to watch a movie without commercials if it isn\u2019t available on DirecTV or Netflix or Amazon, but most people don't want to pay and transactional video on demand just has plummeted.\u201d", "However, even with looming speculation the theater industry can survive the pandemic, both Sloane and Courshon believe there is a pathway for theaters to bounce back. But it starts with grasping hold of COVID-19.", "UNIVERSAL, CINEMARK REACH DEAL TO ALLOW FILMS TO PREMIERE ON-DEMAND EARLY", "\u201cI still think that moviegoing is a unique experience, which cannot be duplicated by watching it on television in your own home,\u201d said Sloane. \u201cSo I think that the answer to that is as soon as people feel comfortable with the pandemic \u2013 that they can go to the theater and not get sick \u2013 I think you're going to have people coming back because going to a cinema is a social experience. It also depends on the picture too.\u201d", "Courshon said he is \u201chopeful\u201d the pandemic hasn\u2019t killed off movie theaters but maintains that \u201csome companies might have to really go into serious bankruptcy.\u201d", "CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "\u201cI've always felt and I still feel that once we are presumably out of the pandemic, whenever that is, I think that the theater business will always survive because people want to go out,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to go out, get out of their home and do things outside the home and entertainment is a part of that.", "He also believes it\u2019s possible the current stand-in film distribution model of releasing films in theaters and on streaming could become a normal avenue of doing business.", "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "\u201cMight the theatrical business be smaller when you know in the future because the pandemic has changed things so much? That's possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Warner is doing now with their movies in 2021, if all the studios are going to be doing things like that with debuting them on their own platform, probably for a premium price of $30 and the theaters have gone along with that because maybe they have no choice -- then frankly, that could be a potential future model that becomes permanent.\u201d"], "authors": ["Julius Young"], "keywords": ["pivot", "film", "courshon", "networks", "coronavirus", "imminent", "slow", "pandemic", "layoffs", "content", "company", "companies", "sloane", "streaming", "think", "business", "experts", "hollywood"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
