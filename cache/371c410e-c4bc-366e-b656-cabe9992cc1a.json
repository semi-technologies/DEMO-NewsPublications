After five goals and a see-saw contest in which BVB scored first and last, and Bayern made the journey back south with the points, it felt like a high-quality US cop show. There was tension from opening to denouement, even if the eventual winners within the allotted time were not unexpected.", "San\u00e9 and Lewandowski seal Klassiker victory for Bayern over Dortmund Read more", "\u201cIn the end the game went as one feared \u2013 and perhaps expected,\u201d wrote Dirk Krampe of Ruhr Nachrichten. \u201cBorussia Dortmund were close. Closer than in the Super Cup, closer than the 0-1 in May, closer anyway than the many heavy away defeats in Munich in the recent past. Not much was missing, but in the end a little something was missing. Once again.\u201d", "Almost a year to the day from when Hansi Flick took charge of Bayern in the Bundesliga for the first time \u2013 and against the same opponents \u2013 so much has changed, even if the winning team hasn\u2019t. On that night it felt as if the champions were galvanised by the occasion, and needed the challenge of their most frequent rivals of recent times to shake themselves out of their funk. In fact, it turns out that it was a nascent tell of what Bayern were about to become, a front-foot monster that would eventually step out of the shadow of Pep Guardiola\u2019s vintage and stride on to even greater heights.", "After the limp submission of that same night, one wondered how much further Dortmund could carry on with Lucien Favre. The fear that his teams are just too passive in the biggest matches remains \u2013 and resurfaced in the Champions League opening-night defeat to Lazio \u2013 but that was not the case here. \u201cBayern are extremely strong attack-wise at the moment,\u201d Mats Hummels told Sky at full-time, \u201cbut very open defensively. So it was always clear that it was going to be this sort of game.\u201d", "The end result could have been different, too. BVB will look back on their inability to hold a lead given to them by a magnificently-crafted Marco Reus goal in the 45th minute even until half-time, on moments in the second half in which Manuel Neuer was mildly inconvenienced but not truly stretched to his best, and on the opportunity Reus had late on to fire an equaliser, but which he only succeeded in thumping into the S\u00fcdtribune.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frustration for Marco Reus against Bayern. Photograph: Leon Kuegeler/AFP/Getty Images", "Yet the Bayern equaliser, scored by David Alaba \u2013 of all people \u2013 at the end of the first period was the game in a nutshell. It was a panicky challenge in the first place by Thomas Delaney on Serge Gnabry as he advanced towards the Dortmund goal. Then, as Bayern executed a free-kick routine more smoothly choreographed than one of Robert Lewandowski\u2019s TikToks \u2013 Gnabry tapping the ball sideways, Lewandowski running over the ball, Thomas M\u00fcller stopping it and Alaba striking \u2013 Hummels spotted the danger, and retreated back to the goalline, to Roman B\u00fcrki\u2019s left. He scrambled, attempted to readjust and after a deflection, just failed to get himself in the spot to ease the shot off the line. Fine, but ultimately decisive margins.", "Relentless Bayern Munich have mastered art of football in lockdown | Barney Ronay Read more", "Yet while Flick and his team flourish \u2013 and there is little reason to suggest they won\u2019t, with the luxury of bringing talent such as Leroy San\u00e9 off the bench to make contributions like his ultimately decisive goal here \u2013 the carrot of genuine competition will continue to be dangled. The coach has publicly wondered whether he should adopt a more circumspect approach, but has seemingly decided that with the talent available to him and the good feeling in the ranks, the level of risk is fine. \u201cBayern lead by scoring a frightening 27 goals after seven games,\u201d wrote S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Martin Schneider on Sunday, \u201cbut with 11 conceded on paper a shakier defence than Augsburg, Stuttgart or Bremen. For a team that won the Champions League and against which a win in the industry is now referred to as the \u2018toughest task in world football\u2019, it\u2019s an astonishing fact.\u201d", "After the meniscus injury suffered here by Joshua Kimmich, one of his irreplaceables, that will keep him out until the winter break, maybe there is room for a rethink. For now, it\u2019s another reason for BVB, habitually fettered by \u201ceight years of expectations projected on to them which never come true\u201d, in Krampe\u2019s words, to stick to their guns. They have issues, not least the below-par form of Jadon Sancho (RN\u2019s Florian Groeger called the England winger \u201ca shadow of himself\u201d) as he misses his rapport with the departed Achraf Hakimi. Yet they have shown enough here, and more importantly in the rest of the season against the league\u2019s lesser lights to keep themselves in the picture until the next face-off.", "That\u2019s what we, and the whole world apart from those with skin in the game, hope for. Fortunately, Flick and Bayern appear game enough to keep delivering.", "Talking points", "Quick guide Bundesliga results Show Hide Bayer Leverkusen 4-3 M\u00f6nchengladbach, Wolfsburg 2-1 Hoffenheim, Dortmund 2-3 Bayern, Augsburg 0-3 Hertha Berlin, Mainz 2-2 Schalke, Leipzig 3-0 Freiburg, Stuttgart 2-2 Eintracht Frankfurt, Union Berlin 5-0 Arminia Bielefeld, Werder Bremen 1-1 Cologne", "\u2022 The battle of the wooden spooners ended as one might have expected, in an unsatisfactory stalemate. Mainz, after losing a lead late on via Jeremiah St Juste\u2019s unlucky own goal, were far from content with a first point of the season while Schalke, having salvaged a draw in a game they had the chances to win, are now on a run of 23 Bundesliga games without a win.", "\u2022 Excluding Saturday night\u2019s headline game, you might say the Bundesliga saved the best for last this weekend, as Bayer Leverkusen overcame Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in a seven-goal thriller. OK, it owed plenty to imperfection \u2013 and Gladbach\u2019s Champions League travails in Ukraine were at the forefront of the mind as they slumped after a good first half \u2013 but there was quality too, notably in Leon Bailey\u2019s beautifully-crafted goal and Valentino Lazaro\u2019s outrageous scorpion kick consolation.
