They calculated dry weight estimates, excluding water. Anthropogenic mass is defined as the mass embedded in inanimate solid objects made by humans and does not include waste.", "The dominant categories in the analysis were human-made mass in the form of buildings and infrastructure, composed of concrete, aggregates, bricks and asphalt. As for global biomass, the majority is accounted for by plants and shrubs.", "They found that at the beginning of the 20th century, the mass of human-produced objects was equal to about 3% of the world\u2019s total biomass. But in 2020, human-made mass has reached about 1.1 teratonnes, exceeding overall global biomass.", "As human-made mass has increased, so too has the impact on plant biomass. \u201cSince the first agricultural revolution, humanity has roughly halved the mass of plants,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWhile modern agriculture utilises an increasing land area for growing crops, the total mass of domesticated crops is vastly outweighed by the loss of plant mass resulting from deforestation, forest management and other land-use changes. These trends in global biomass have affected the carbon cycle and human health.\u201d", "Over the decades there are rises and dips in human impact, including sharp increases after the switch in the 1950s from bricks to concrete and the use of asphalt for pavements in the 1960s.", "\u201cShifts in total anthropogenic mass are tied to global events such as world wars and major economic crises,\u201d the paper says. Most notably, there are continuous increases in human-made mass of more than 5% per year from the period immediately following the second world war, which became known as the \u201cgreat acceleration\u201d and was characterised by enhanced consumption and urban development.", "Conversely, during times of downturn the weight of the human footprint decreases. There are key dips seen during the Great Depression and the 1979 oil crash.", "\u201cThe face of Earth in the 21st century is affected in an unprecedented manner by the activities of humanity and the production and accumulation of human-made objects,\u201d the researchers say.", "Since 1900 overall biomass has decreased slightly, whereas human-made mass has increased rapidly to a production rate of more than 30 gigatonnes (30,000,000,000 tonnes) per year. If human production continues at this rate, the weight of our impact will exceed 3 teratonnes by 2040.", "\u201cThis study joins recent efforts to quantify and evaluate the scale and impact of human activities on our planet,\u201d the paper says. \u201cThe impacts of these activities have been so abrupt and considerable that it has been proposed that the current geological epoch be renamed the Anthropocene. Our study rigorously and quantitatively substantiates this proposal.\u201d"], "authors": ["Sandra Laville"], "keywords": ["biomass", "earths", "world", "weight", "production", "mass", "materials", "human", "study", "humanmade", "impact", "global", "total", "outweigh", "entire"], "pubDate": "2020-12-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
