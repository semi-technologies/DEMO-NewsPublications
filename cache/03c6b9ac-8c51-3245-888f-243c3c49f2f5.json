But luckily for us fashion lovers, the Alexander McQueen brand employs a more magical way of thinking. On Greene Street in New York\u2019s Soho, beside plywood-covered windows and bolted shut doors, the new McQueen store shimmers, thanks to a display of hundreds of beetles and butterflies in the window.", "On a sleepy post-election, pre-results weekday, it was the hottest address in the neighborhood by a landslide, despite not having officially opened. As security guards turned away several sets of interested shoppers, a McQueen employee in one of Sarah Burton\u2019s bias-cut suits was giving a FaceTime tour to a friend of the brand abroad. Inside, past the beetled curtain, it\u2019s easy to see why people are eager to get inside.
