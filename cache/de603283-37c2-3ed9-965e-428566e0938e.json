Everyone laughs at this. There is a truth to our line, though, one that hints at possibilities that are much more complex than whatever genitalia our child might be born with: the truth that we ultimately have no idea who\u2014rather than what\u2014is growing inside my belly. Who will this person be? What kind of person will we become parents to? How will they change our lives and who we are? This is a wondrous and terrifying concept, one that renders us both helpless and humbled.", "I like the idea of forcing as few gender stereotypes on my child as possible. But no matter how progressive I may hope to be, I understand the desire to know the gender of our fetus; it feels like the first real opportunity to glimpse who they might be. As my body changes in bizarre and unfamiliar ways, it\u2019s comforting to obtain any information that might make what\u2019s coming feel more real.", "It occurs to me that as a younger person I\u2019d almost automatically imagined myself having a daughter. I remember playing as a child, holding baby dolls and picturing myself with a future best friend: something like the American Girl doll I owned, who had brown eyes and brown hair to mirror my own features, a smaller version of myself.", "When I bring this thought to my therapist, she explains that this is relatively common. Psychology du jour, she says, touts the concept that people may have children to \u201credo\u201d their own childhood. They want to fix themselves and their traumas by trying again with a fresh start and a mini version of themselves.", "\u201cWho will this person be?

I guess I\u2019d just never really thought about having a boy before. \u201d", "\u201cI do worry a girl will have a lot to live up to as your daughter,\u201d he replies. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of pressure.\u201d I wince and think of my own mother and her tales of being homecoming queen, the way I knew the word jealous at the age of three (I pronounced it \u201cjealoust,\u201d telling my mother that her female colleagues were \u201cjust jealoust\u201d of her), and the early understanding I had of how beauty could equate to power. I prayed for beauty, pinching my nose tightly on either side before falling asleep, willing it to stay small. I think of the other physically beautiful mothers I\u2019ve known\u2014the stage moms with their own mini-mes. The way their daughters, even as young girls, seem to know their own beauty, as if they have already lived entire lives in a grown woman\u2019s body. I think about how women compare one another constantly, doing acrobatic calculations in their heads: In this way I\u2019m similar to her, in this way I\u2019m not; in this way I\u2019m better, in this way I\u2019m not.", "\u201cI remembered playing as a child, holding baby dolls and picturing myself with an imagined, future best friend: a smaller version of me\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll never let that be an issue,\u201d I tell my husband, but I can\u2019t help worrying. I still fight subconscious and internalized misogyny on a regular basis, catching myself as I measure the width of my hips against another woman\u2019s.
