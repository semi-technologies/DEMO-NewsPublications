No, not unless they are part of an \u201cexclusive\u201d support bubble, which allows a single-person household to meet and socialise with another household.

People are allowed to meet one person from another household socially and for exercise in outdoor public spaces, which does not include private gardens.

Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are not permitted except in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. Places of worship must remain closed except for voluntary services, individual prayer and other exempt activities. Can I travel in the UK or abroad for a holiday? Most outbound international travel will be banned. There is no exemption for staying away from home for a holiday. This means people cannot travel internationally or within the UK, unless for work, education or other legally permitted exemptions. Which businesses will close? Everything except essential shops and education settings, which include nurseries, schools and universities, will close. Entertainment venues will also have to close. Pubs, restaurants and indoor and outdoor leisure facilities will have to close their doors once more. However, takeaway and delivery services will still be allowed, while construction and manufacturing will stay open. Parents will still be able to access registered childcare and other childcare activities where reasonably necessary to enable parents to work. Some youth services may be able to continue, such as one-to-one youth work, but most youth clubs will need to close their doors. Public services, such as jobcentres, courts, and civil registration offices will remain open. There is no exemption for grassroots organised team sports. Elite sports will be allowed to continue behind closed doors as currently, including Premier League football matches.
