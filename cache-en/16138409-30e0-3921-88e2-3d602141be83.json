Now it's all in lower case, as if the Internet could be any old \u201cinternet\u201d at all. When did this change happen, and why didn't I notice it at the time?

The convention now reads as dated, even archaic, like those allusions to Beauty, Truth, and Nature in Romantic poetry\u2014as though we once endowed the web (formerly the Web) with all the grandeur of a Platonic form. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re alone in your confusion about when and how the change happened. History, even very recent history, is a casualty of our accelerated age. The newsfeed is forever disappearing into the void, like the Greek parable about forgetfulness in which a man endlessly braids a straw rope while a donkey, lurking behind him, eats the completed end.", "It sounds as though you already have some familiarity with the Internet vs. internet debate. For those who are new to it, I should stress that the capitalization was not meant to signal transcendence, singularity, or a whiff of the absolute. Quite the opposite: It underscored that the Internet we used was just one particular iteration of the larger category of internets, just as our nation\u2019s Constitution (which we capitalize, like all proper nouns) is just one of many national constitutions (which, as a generic noun, remains lowercased). The internet that we know and use today grew out of the Pentagon\u2019s Arpanet network (aka, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) in the late 1960s, but throughout the '80s and '90s, it was just one of many instantiations of the Internet protocol suite used by educational and commercial networks. Eventually, Arpanet would come to be known as Internet. Once it evolved into the World Wide Web, it was appended with the definite article\u2014the Internet\u2014though the capital \u201cI\u201d served as an implicit reminder that it was just one example of the technology, an Internet among internets.", "It is common for technologies to shift from proper nouns to generic ones as they become incorporated into the culture. Some forward-looking voices predicted, as early as the late-1990s, that the Internet would succumb to the same fate as television and radio, mediums that were similarly capitalized at first, until they became part of our everyday landscape. In 2004, WIRED.com\u2014then distinct from the print periodical, WIRED magazine\u2014switched to lower case. (When WIRED magazine\u2019s parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast, bought the website two years later, the standard capitalization was reimposed.) It\u2019s telling that many of the earliest publications to make the switch to \u201cinternet\u201d were magazines that originated online\u2014proving the adage that fish, least of all, are aware of the water in which they swim.", "I should stress that the capitalization was not meant to signal transcendence, singularity, or a whiff of the absolute.", "One of the common arguments for decapitalization\u2014that the capital \u201cI\u201d was too loud and intrusive\u2014mirrored, in an interesting way, the aspirations of digital technologies themselves. Mark Weiser, the Xerox computer scientist who coined the term \u201cubiquitous computing,\u201d spoke longingly of the day when computers would \u201cvanish into the background,\u201d weaving themselves \u201cinto the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.\u201d As a growing number of sites and publications began switching to the more unassuming \u201cinternet,\u201d it seemed like a tacit acknowledgement that these technologies had succeeded in becoming invisible, that we now moved in and out of cyberspace\u2014a passage once marked, unmistakably, by the foghorn of the dial-up modem\u2014in the same elegant, unthinking silence that accompanied our use of electricity or water. After the United Nations declared Internet access a fundamental human right in 2011, the lowercase internet became even more compelling (despite the fact that the report itself capitalized the word): The information highway had become just another public good that anyone could access, like air or city parks, not some imperious proper noun like Catholicism or the Democratic Party.", "The decisive moment came in 2016, when the Associated Press announced that its Stylebook would switch to lower case. The Washington Post and The New York Times quickly followed, for fear of seeming out of step. (So did WIRED magazine and WIRED.com.) \u201cWe want our rules for spelling, punctuation and usage to be largely invisible,\u201d said the Times. The new convention was, indeed, so invisible, so seamless, that many people, like you, [101], remained blissfully unaware of the change\u2014or the outcry from those who fiercely opposed it."], "authors": ["Meghan O'Gieblyn", "Meghan O'Giebly"], "keywords": ["web", "technologies", "world", "used", "lower", "capital", "think", "support", "internet", "proper", "hello", "wired"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
