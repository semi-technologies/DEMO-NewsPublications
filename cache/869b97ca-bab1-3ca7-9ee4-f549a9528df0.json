Five men sat on a bench, their casual demeanor betraying no awareness that they are viewed as a key variable in the election, and are a demographic that Trump is courting, with claims that he\u2019s making the criminal-justice system more equitable.", "The men on the bench all served time in prison. One of them, heavyset, with an armful of tattoos, did twenty-nine years. He had voted early, and would say only that he had not voted for Trump: \u201cThe way he talked to people, the way he talked to the news representatives, when he talks to Blacks . . .\u201d His buddies nodded. \u201cBut, if he loses, it won\u2019t be because Biden was better, but because they don\u2019t like Trump.\u201d", "Convicted felons in Florida who have completed their sentences can vote, under the state\u2019s Amendment 4, but only after five to seven years and the payment of all back fines.", "A recent Hill-Harris poll of Florida voters found that thirteen per cent of Black respondents planned to vote for Trump. (In 2016, Trump won only eight per cent of the Black vote in Florida, according to an exit poll conducted by NBC.) The President\u2019s gains among Black voters can likely be attributed specifically to Black men. In September, a Nationscape survey of likely voters found that, although at least eighty-seven per cent of Black women planned to vote for Biden, only seventy-six per cent of Black men planned to do so. (According to Gallup, Trump\u2019s approval rating among Black men is also eight points higher than it is among Black women.) Jim Messina, who ran President Obama\u2019s re\u00eblection campaign, told this magazine, last week, \u201cIf Biden can win Florida early on Election Night, it\u2019s over.\u201d", "A few blocks away, a dreadlocked man in his thirties was tidying up a sidewalk caf\u00e9 that he owns. He hasn\u2019t been out of prison long enough to be able to vote, but he said he wouldn\u2019t vote even if he could. He has views, though. \u201cI like Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is now pushing people with power out. Like Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate on how he believed Epstein had been brought to justice. He thinks that Trump is being unfairly criticized about his taxes. \u201cHe paid some money, something like seven hundred and fifty dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a businessman, and, when you learn about business, you learn about what not to do.\u201d He went on, \u201cI mean, the Amazon guy didn\u2019t pay nothing, and he made billions.\u201d", "Several doors down, another man was working on some electrical wiring at a landmark house. He also has not been out of prison long enough to be able to vote, but he said that, if he could, he wouldn\u2019t choose Trump. About the Democratic candidates, he said, \u201cThey should be reversed. Harris on the top.\u201d", "Over at the Salvation Army Center for Worship, a man named John Battle was taking a break from a service. Inside, several dozen other people, mostly former addicts and men who had been incarcerated, sat close together, without masks. Brought up in orphanages, Battle was a football star in high school, but in his twenties he ended up on the streets, and then in prison. Now forty-six, he has been out for only a few months, so he can\u2019t vote, either. Among his friends, he said, \u201ca lot like Donald Trump because he is straightforward. They believe the other guy is about raising taxes and taking away Social Security, and a lot of them are on it, and a lot get disability.\u201d", "As for the way the government treats Black people, he said, \u201cThey are always putting a \u2018pause\u2019 on things. Even with the stimulus. I got out on May 7th and filed for it, and I was told because I was in prison I can\u2019t get it yet. And white guys I know filed in June and July and immediately got their checks. And when I called I was told, \u2018There is nothing we can do.\u2019 \u201d", "Edward James III is a thirty-year-old community organizer and teacher at the Visible Men Academy, a school near Sarasota for Black and Hispanic boys, many with fathers who are incarcerated. He is unhappy that so few of the Black men he talks to are supporting Biden. \u201cI do understand where people are coming from when they say their lives had not changed under President Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been caught in a cycle of generational poverty and you\u2019ve never really been anywhere. You\u2019re still poor. You\u2019re still having run-ins with the police. You\u2019re still seeing violence. You\u2019re still seeing death. You\u2019re still seeing drugs, right?\u201d He went on, \u201cIf your everyday life is focussed on: How do I keep my lights on? How do I send money to my brother in prison? How do I make sure my daughter is not sexually assaulted by the man down the street? You\u2019re not thinking about things at the federal level. I get where they\u2019re coming from, but it\u2019s very misguided.\u201d", "Trump, he continued, is \u201cpreying on Black people the same way he preys on poor, uneducated white people. He preys on their racism and tries to get them to vote against their own interests. Now, I haven\u2019t heard many Black men say they\u2019re voting for President Trump, but I will say there\u2019s not that much excitement for Biden.\u201d For some, he said, \u201cI think he\u2019s just flat-out uninspiring. A lot of people put their trust and dreams in Obama, and their lives have not changed.\u201d He got a dreamy look in his eyes. \u201cBut still\u2014Barack Obama! Once you\u2019ve had filet mignon, everything else is like chopped liver.\u201d \u2666"], "authors": ["Charlayne Hunter-Gault", "Charlayne Hunter-Gaul"], "keywords": ["youre", "demographic", "swing", "men", "prison", "man", "florida", "way", "biden", "trump", "black", "election", "vote"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
