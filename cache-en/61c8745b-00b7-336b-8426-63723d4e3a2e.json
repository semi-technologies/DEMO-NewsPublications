RICK SCOTT: COVID CHANGED EVERYTHING THIS YEAR \u2014 INCLUDING VOTING. HERE'S HOW WE RESTORE TRUST", "People are moving to and staying in Florida because they want low taxes and small government. They want to escape socialism, to raise strong families and to send their kids to good schools. They want to work hard and be entrepreneurial, and they want to be able to forge a future for themselves and their families.", "Just two days before the Nov. 3 election, Democratic vice-presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris stated that the goal of equity among Americans is not equal opportunity, but equal outcomes.", "Too many Floridians are familiar with the language of equality of outcomes, and they know that it leaves everyone equally poor. They have heard the empty promises of the late communist leaders Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro of Cuba. And more importantly, Floridians have seen the violence and authoritarianism that too often follows those empty promises.", "People \u2014 including many fleeing communism and socialism in Latin America and elsewhere \u2014 have moved to Florida because they don\u2019t want to live under the economic policies that the left is increasingly embracing in this country.", "Between 2016 and 2020, President Trump significantly improved his standing among Latino voters. That\u2019s a reflection of both his hard work to reach out to those communities and the Democrats\u2019 hard turn to the left.", "But the growth in support for President Trump wasn\u2019t limited to Latinos only. President Trump saw an 8-point increase among all non-White voters in Florida, according to exit polls, and made significant inroads in predominantly African American communities like West Park.", "Republicans have built a multi-ethnic, working-class coalition of Florida voters who don\u2019t like big government, don\u2019t like socialism and just want the opportunity to live their lives in freedom and peace.", "This doesn\u2019t mean that all government is bad. It just means that government should live within its means and that essential services provided by government \u2014 like the national defense and important safety net programs \u2014 should be efficiently and effectively managed.", "In my races for governor and the U.S. Senate, I didn\u2019t treat Latino voters as an afterthought, an add-on, or an \u201coutreach\u201d group. Latinos were fundamental to all of my elections, and are fundamental to the emerging Republican coalition that leads the way in Florida.", "President Trump had incredible success in Florida because his message resonated with this diverse coalition of voters who don\u2019t neatly fit into the pundits\u2019 and pollsters\u2019 conception of the political world. And he worked to earn votes in my state \u2014 a necessity that Florida Democrats seemingly forgot about decades ago.", "All this explains why the success of Florida Republicans, including the president, is a model for Republicans across the country.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER", "The Democratic message is losing.

Kamala Harris said it herself. They want equal outcomes rather than equal opportunity. This attitude, if put into practice, would certainly lead to equality. It would make everyone equally poor and it would put government \u2014 not individualism, not family, not faith \u2014 at the center of American life.", "America is always at its strongest when the American people have the freedom, security and opportunity to make choices for themselves. The Democrats want to control your life; Republicans want to give you a life. That\u2019s the fundamental difference dividing the two parties right now.", "CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM SEN.
