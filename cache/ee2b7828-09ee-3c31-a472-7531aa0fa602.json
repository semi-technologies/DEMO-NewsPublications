The Queen\u2019s Gambit may be the newer project, but with its 1950s and early \u201960s costumes and exploration of elegant destinations, it\u2019s a visual treat, especially given the current travel restrictions. This story of Beth Harmon, an orphan turned chess master played by Anya Taylor-Joy who electrifies the game\u2019s male-dominated scene, recreates the mood of an era while providing insight into the protagonist\u2019s troubled mind. \u201cShe comes from this poor background and an orphanage, where she didn\u2019t have a context for fashion, so it\u2019s something she\u2019s had to discover on her own,\u201d says costume designer Gabriele Binder. \u201cI always tried to have her be outstanding and different from everyone else around her, whether at school or in [chess], where all the other players are men.\u201d", "The complexity of the period\u2019s gender dynamics and Beth\u2019s eventual descent into addiction had to be worked into Taylor-Joy\u2019s costumes, several of which had multiple versions depending on the scenes\u2019 level of tumult. \u201cThat was fun because there\u2019s one side of her is glamorous and another that is destroyed,\u201d says Binder, who referenced designers like Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent while creating. \u201cWe have a dress that is very Cardin, but it\u2019s created in this fabric that is too heavy instead of something that would have been used during that era. We wanted to show how Beth\u2019s life had gotten too heavy.\u201d The drama may be intense, but Binder allowed for fun moments and a playful chessboard motif that carries through Beth\u2019s entire wardrobe. \u201cThere is no perhaps in chess,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about contrasts: black or white, win or lose. I thought we needed that minimalism, and the \u201960s have so much of that in looks from Mondrian, Cardin, and Saint Laurent. I wanted to connect the fashion with the game because it\u2019s the most important thing in her life, and she would intuitively seek out [clothes] that mirror it.\u201d"], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["costumes", "princess", "crown", "life", "saint", "queen", "cardin", "dianas", "binder", "wanted", "zoom", "heavy", "wedding", "beths", "dress", "chess", "laurent"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
