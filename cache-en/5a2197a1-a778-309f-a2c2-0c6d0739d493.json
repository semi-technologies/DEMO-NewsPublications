But for those with traditional M\u0101ori tattoos, known as moko, she has long been breaking down barriers.", "In 2016, after taking part in a M\u0101ori tattooing design ceremony, Mahuta became the first female member of parliament to wear lip and chin markings, or moko kauae. Traditional tattoos offer \"positive ways to enable cultural expression and pride in being M\u0101ori,\" she tweeted last year.", "While still a rare sight in national politics, facial moko are increasingly common in contemporary New Zealand society. The tattoos often carry huge cultural significance for the wearer, telling a visual story that connect Indigenous people to their ancestors.", "Each individual's moko is unique and may relate to their social status, occupation or personal and family history. The complex designs also allude to the wearer's genealogy (which in Mahuta's case, ties her to the late M\u0101ori queen, Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu and the current M\u0101ori monarch, Kingi Tuheitia, according to Radio New Zealand ). Markings on the left and right sides of the face refer to the lineage of a person's father and mother, respectively.", "A member of the M\u0101ori group Tainui Waka Alliance at Te Papa Museum in Wellington in 2012, as the museum welcomed 20 mummified tattooed heads that were taken to Europe in the 1700s and 1800s.

A common origin story involves a mythological figure, Mataoro, who fell in love with and married Niwareka, the daughter of an underworld ruler.", "After beating her in fit of rage, Mataoro followed his wife to the underworld to seek forgiveness. While there, Niwareka's father taught him the art of t\u0101 moko and, sanctioning his return to the \"upper\" world, marked him with tattoos as a reminder to avoid future acts of evil.", "A woman with lip and chin markings, known as moko kauae, at the Alte Nationalgalerie museum in Berlin in 2014.

They often took place in temporary outdoor shelters, with the person being tattooed only permitted to eat through a carved funnel, which also helped to reduce the likelihood of infection. The recipient would be expected to abstain from sexual contact or washing while they healed.", "Traditionally, men would have markings on their face, buttocks and thighs, while women usually carried them on their lips and chin.", "Though tattooing has been practiced in Polynesian societies for centuries, M\u0101ori groups developed their own specific techniques and tools. Organic pigments -- made by burning resin from kauri trees, and mixing the soot and with oil or other liquids -- would be chiseled beneath the top layers of skin using tools forged from bird bones, commonly those of albatrosses. (Around the turn of the 20th century, the use of needles became more common, while today, modern tattooing machines are also used.)", "The prevalence of facial moko went into decline following the arrival of Europeans -- not least because the preserved heads of tattooed M\u0101ori warriors became highly coveted among colonizers. Facial tattoos' association with gangs or criminality in other cultures may also have contributed to their decline.", "The late Ngapuhi elder Kingi Taurua delivers a speech at Te Tii Marae in Waitangi, New Zealand, in 2012.

Maxwell, who is aged 54, said that the \"normalization\" of traditional tattoos in New Zealand began in the 1990s and 2000s, after earlier generations had distanced themselves from the practice.", "\"There was lots of negativity, not just from non-M\u0101ori communities but also from our own communities, because our parents and grandparents were of the mind that the moko should be left in the past.", "\"But we, the younger generation of that time, weren't prepared to let the art form become a memory, (so we chose) to bring it back as a living art form and to announce to the world that we are M\u0101ori.\"", "Opportunities to educate", "While Maxwell said he had \"experienced no stigma\" as a result of his moko, there have been periodic reports of Indigenous people being refused service in bars or restaurants as a result of having visible tattoos.", "Yet, there are also a growing number of high-profile figures with facial markings in New Zealand society, such as journalist Oriini Kaipara, who last year became the first woman with moko kauae to present the news on a mainstream TV station.", "Journalist Oriini Kaipara speaking at the Power Of Inclusion Summit 2019 in Auckland, New Zealand.

Mike Tyson, Rihanna and British pop star Robbie Williams have all been criticized for adopting M\u0101ori-style tattoos in recent years. Fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier also stirred controversy in 2007, when he applied moko-inspired designs to Caucasian models' faces for a fashion campaign.", "Maxwell, however, welcomes interest from other cultures, seeing it as a chance to educate people about M\u0101ori traditions. He described Mahuta's recent appointment as one such opportunity, seeing it as \"significant moment\" for Indigenous communities.", "\"She will take the moko to places it has never been before -- to consulates, to embassies and government offices throughout the world,\" he said.", "Nanaia Mahuta, the first female member of parliament to wear moko kauae, pictured in February 2020.
