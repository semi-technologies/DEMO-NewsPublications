It feels very slapdash.\u201d", "The couple were in France from March to June and were taken aback by lax norms upon returning home, said Delphine, 45. \u201cIn Tesco we were the only ones wearing a mask.

Covid has taken over,\u201d he said.", "Lockdown in March saw his food donation points in churches, schools and surgeries closed overnight. At the same time, demand for food in Camborne, Pool and Redruth\u2019s deprived neighbourhoods, which are among the 10% most deprived in the country, tripled from around 8,000-9,000 meals a month to 26,000. This came as Gardner lost 95% of his volunteers, because they were over 70 and vulnerable.", "\u201cI don\u2019t panic. I looked for a way out,\u201d said Gardner, 75.", "Instead of food donations, he appealed for money. Instead of bulk-buying in supermarkets \u2013 prohibited during lockdown amid panic-buying \u2013 he turned to a catering company.", "Food is now decanted from large catering packs \u2013 normally sold to restaurants \u2013 and frozen. Furloughed workers have stepped in as volunteers. Financial support from Feeding Britain and Cornwall Community Association allowed him to buy industrial freezers, and to provide ready-made frozen meals for children during school holidays. Local farmers have donated fresh vegetables, normally sold to local hotels and guest houses.", "On 23 December, the Christmas hampers will be delivered to the most deprived by volunteers with vans and by Cornwall fire service. Help had come from all quarters, Gardner said. \u201cThe Cornish people have really pulled together on this. I could cry sometimes when people ring me up,\u201d he said.", "And he has had to transform the way the food bank operates against a backdrop of intense personal grief. In the summer he lost his wife to a sudden, non-Covid illness, with restrictions preventing him from seeing her in hospital for one month until he was allowed one visit to say goodbye.", "What he fears now is how people will cope in January. Christmas spending combined with job losses will, he believes, see demand for the food bank \u201cgo through the roof\u201d.", "Brexit was one of the deciding issues that saw the Conservative MP George Eustice, now environment secretary, increase his majority in marginal Camborne and Redruth in 2019.", "Gardner voted to leave, and Brexit was a factor in him lending his vote to the Conservatives, when he would perhaps normally have voted Labour.", "For now, he has no regrets. \u201cWe just need to get it done and pick up our country and get on, that\u2019s what I feel,\u201d he said. He doubts, too, if a Labour government would have handled the pandemic better, \u201cbecause it would still be the same scientists, and that\u2019s where you\u2019ve got to get the information from\u201d.", "But he wonders if the fallout from Covid will see the Conservatives struggle to hold the seat. The huge debt the country faces worries him, \u201cthe cost, and how the government of the day deals with it, and how that will affect the people I see in the food bank\u201d.", "\u201cCovid is hopefully a one-off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the prosperity of the country will be tested and tried big time because of the huge debt.

They sourced fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and menu cards to supplement the tinned soup and pasta.", "\u201cIt has been the busiest year of my life,\u201d Carroll said. When the lockdown began, many locals were in denial, she said. \u201cBut then when services started disappearing, there was that panic of trying to get food.

Covid has killed several dozen of his parishioners, and the crisis has greatly worsened the health of others. Casey estimates he buried 200 people in the six months from March to September; normally it would be 180 a year. There have been suicides, drugs overdoses, the morbidly ill dying sooner and a spate of care home deaths.", "\u201cIt has been a year where we\u2019ve had to work very, very long hours, seven days a week,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if we didn\u2019t, people would starve.\u201d", "There have been positive developments. They are now hoping to convert a vacant two-storey bank into a new drop-in centre, with consultation spaces for council agencies such as Skills Development Scotland and for Glasgow Kelvin college to put on vocational courses, Carroll said. And the old drop-in centre, a repurposed shop provided rent-free by Springburn shopping centre, still houses weekly substance abuse and mental health groups.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of success stories, and managed to do a lot of good stuff,\u201d Casey said. \u201cIt has definitely brought lots of fragmented groups together.
