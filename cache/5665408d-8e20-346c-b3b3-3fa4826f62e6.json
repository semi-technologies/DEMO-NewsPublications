So it must have been delightful for the government to change the subject on September 21st by issuing a map showing that the country\u2019s territory is nearly double its former size. It illustrates the effect of a law Mr Fern\u00e1ndez signed in August, which expands Argentina by 1.7m square km (650,000 square miles), an area three times the size of metropolitan France. Argentina now bestrides South America and Antarctica, from the Tropic of Capricorn to the South Pole. Its territory includes some of the world\u2019s richest fishing grounds and possibly oil and gas. The Falkland islands, which Argentines call the Malvinas, lie within it.", "This is not entirely based on fantasy. In 2016 the UN \u2019s Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf ( CLCS ) issued a ruling, based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, that fixes the edge of the vast shelf that juts out from Argentina\u2019s coast. There the seabed is shallow enough\u2014less than 2,500 metres deep\u2014to count as an extension of Argentina\u2019s mainland. The effect of the ruling is to extend Argentina\u2019s territorial waters beyond the normal 200 nautical miles (370km).", "Mauricio Macri, Argentina\u2019s then-president, a conservative, celebrated the ruling in 2016 as a diplomatic victory but did not write it into law. His priority was friendly relations with the rest of the world, including Britain. In 1982 Britain fought a war to expel Argentina\u2019s armed forces, which had invaded the Falklands that year.", "Mr Fern\u00e1ndez, a left-leaning Peronist, is more assertive. The law he signed in August, and the borders on his map, take in far more than the area to which CLCS said Argentina was entitled. In sending the territorial-expansion bill to Congress this year, Mr Fern\u00e1ndez insisted on \u201cArgentina\u2019s claim to the Malvinas\u201d, which has long been part of its law and is endorsed by nearly all Argentines."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["antarctic", "fern\u00e1ndez", "argentinas", "territory", "square", "alberto", "south", "doubles", "argentina", "size", "ruling", "signed", "law", "claims"], "pubDate": "2020-10-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
