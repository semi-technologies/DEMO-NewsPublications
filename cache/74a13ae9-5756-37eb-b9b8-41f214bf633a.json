This behavior hasn\u2019t been studied in children specifically, but any parent could see how it could apply (sibling-on-sibling sadism, anyone?).", "Older research also indicates that we\u2019re strongly motivated to avoid boredom, even if it means self-inflicting pain. In one study, published in the journal Science in 2014, 18 college students were invited to sit alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes in the presence of a device that delivered electric shocks. Nearly half (more men than women) chose to shock themselves for no reason other than something to do. (These findings were later replicated in a slightly larger study of 69 college students in 2016.)", "Everyone feels bored from time to time, but experts estimate that around 10 to 15 percent of people tend to experience it more frequently and more intensely than others. While research in this area is still developing, this propensity for being easily bored has been loosely linked with a range of negative outcomes, including increased risk-taking, binge drinking and aggression. Preliminary research borne out of the pandemic has even found that boredom-prone people are less likely to social distance or wear masks.", "And people with more run-of-the-mill tedium, or what researchers call \u201cstate boredom,\u201d has been linked to poor academic performance and even may play a role in overeating.", "Of course, academics have only been paying close attention to the field of boredom in the last few decades, and none of these studies prove that boredom alone causes these behaviors.
