Sorry, he said, in that reflexive way people do when they\u2019re trying to fight back their tears, but it had been a long, hard day. Jess is a sports agent in Australia and his head was still wrapped up in a phone call he\u2019d just had with one of his clients, a retired player suffering from a long-term brain injury and struggling badly with depression. It had been a tough conversation, and taken a lot out of both of them. Jess has had a lot of those in the past decade.", "Right now all the attention is on the long-term effects of head trauma in rugby union, but, Jess says: \u201cThere\u2019s compelling evidence in all countries that tells us these collision-based sports are creating long-term neurological trauma for past, present and future players.\u201d", "This problem is not confined by borders. If it is an issue in England and Wales, it will be one in France, Ireland, South Africa and everywhere else they play the game. And it isn\u2019t restricted by code. We already know it is a problem in American football, ice hockey and boxing and we\u2019re increasingly aware it is becoming one in football, rugby league and Australian rules football.", "Which is where Jess comes in. Jess represents a group of 135 former VFL and AFL players who have all been diagnosed with long-term neurological problems. Some of them started playing in the 1970s, some just finished. \u201cI have seven or eight young blokes who have recently retired. I would say five of them are at the acute end, where they\u2019ve had to retire from accumulation of impacts and concussions,\u201d he says, \u201cand people are still telling me it\u2019s safe.\u201d", "Just like Steve Thompson, Alix Popham, Michael Lipman and the rest of the rugby union players who have been recently diagnosed with early-onset dementia and probable CTE, Jess\u2019s group have been diagnosed through a combination of neurocognitive testing and DTI scans. In the first group they examined, they found 87.5% of footballers who had played five years or more demonstrated chronic neuropathological impairment. \u201cBut we can measure year on year the structural changes to the brain and what we found is that after 10 years the structural damage had moved to 92%. So the longer you play, the more damage you are likely to have.\u201d", "Shaun Smith, pictured playing for Werribee in 2001, recently won an insurance payout after sustaining multiple concussions while playing. Photograph: Getty Images", "Jess has a good grasp of the complicated medical science behind concussion and enormous anger about the way it has been handled by the authorities across all contact sports. These days, he spends a lot of time campaigning. He recently helped the former AFL player Shaun Smith win a A$1.4m insurance payout for \u201ctotal and permanent disablement caused by multiple concussions while playing football\u201d, in what could be a landmark case.", "Jess is campaigning for sports to tighten up return-to-play rules, invest more in existing biomarker technology to help detect brain trauma and is also pursuing a case with Work Safe, the statutory authority in charge of workplace safety in Victoria.", "He is doing it because he has seen for himself, over and again, what the game he loves and has given his life to has done to some of the players he works with. Jess has known the older ones a long time, he started representing them in the 1980s. \u201cThey were fine, fit young men in the prime of their physical condition.\u201d", "Like everyone else who has been involved in the discussion around concussion, brain trauma and sport, Jess has heard the argument, advanced by some scientists and administrators, that anecdotes are not evidence. It is why the Concussion in Sport Group (which helps to shape concussion policy across all these sports) doesn\u2019t include individual case studies in the evidence it uses to write its consensus statement. Instead it insists on longitudinal cohort studies, which map the effects of concussion on a group over time and contrast it with a control.", "Which is one reason why the 2017 concussion consensus, still the key document on this issue in world sport, was based on 47 studies out of 3,819 considered. Which is one reason why campaigners believe sport\u2019s concussion policies have to be redesigned to make them more patient-centred.", "Because each of those case studies represents a suffering athlete and often a struggling partner and a broken family, too, as Jess knows all too well.", "\u201cI\u2019ve monitored some of these guys from their late-teens through to their mid-50s,\u201d says Jess. \u201cAnd I feel I\u2019m the chronicler of the long\u2011term neurological problems these guys are suffering. Whilst I\u2019m not articulating my study in terms of a peer-reviewed assessment, I\u2019m doing it on the ground, every day. What we found is that the most catastrophic events are the behavioural and mood issues, because they destroy families.\u201d", "Talk to the players\u2019 partners and you\u2019ll learn all the longitudinal information you need about how these men have changed over time. \u201cOften the blokes don\u2019t ring me,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause the blokes think they\u2019re fine, they think they\u2019re OK.\u201d", "Instead it\u2019s the partners who call for help. Some of them are women \u201cwho have had to go and lock the door and hide from their husband because he\u2019s gone nuts\u201d. Then Jess has to go back \u201cand speak to their husbands and say \u2018this is what has happened, I\u2019ve spoken to your wife, and this is how you\u2019ve changed after this concussion, and this concussion, and this concussion\u2019\u201d.", "Jess says: \u201cI\u2019m not about to attack the game. But the game is the people and we\u2019ve got to protect the people who are the game.\u201d"], "authors": ["Andy Bull"], "keywords": ["longterm", "players", "playing", "head", "studies", "football", "trauma", "cases", "concussion", "game", "australian", "recently", "jess", "global", "rules", "issue", "group"], "pubDate": "2020-12-16T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
