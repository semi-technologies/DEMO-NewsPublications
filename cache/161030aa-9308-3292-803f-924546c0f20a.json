It was seriously, almost unpleasantly, hot. A different experience awaits horses and racegoers in the Bois de Boulogne this afternoon, as the intermittent but heavy showers which hit Paris on Saturday are expected to continue up to and after the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe at 3.05pm British Standard Time. The sun, as it happens, is out at the moment but as far as the ground goes, the damage has been done.", "", "The good news for fans of Enable, who will be attempting to record a historic third success in the Arc, is that she has three Group One wins on soft ground to her name, in the Arc (at Chantilly) in 2017, the King George at Ascot the same year and the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf last November.", "", "When it comes to her main market rivals, the situation is less clear-cut. Japan won his maiden on soft ground in September last year but has done all his racing since on good ground or better. Ghaiyyath has yet to race on anything slower than good, while a Listed win on good-to-soft is all that Sottsass brings to the party. And when it comes to the three Japanese runners \u2013 Kiseki, Blast Onepiece and Fierement \u2013 they have scarcely a couple of runs on anything other than firm ground to rub together.", "Enable just winning the 2019 Prix de l\u2019Arc De Triomphe.

If so, all we need now is for the heaviest showers to head elsewhere and Enable to win the Arc for this to be one of the great racing days. The odds on the latter are around 8-11.
