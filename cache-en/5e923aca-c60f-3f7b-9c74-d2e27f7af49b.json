Photograph: Scharfsinn/Alamy", "The Pritt stick is that rare thing \u2013 a brand, like Hoover, Velcro or Google, that becomes generic; there may be other glue sticks, but they will never be anything more than impostors. \u201cPritt will always be the reliable yet totally badass friend you know will never let you down,\u201d says freelance children\u2019s book designer Hannah Ahmed, who attributes her choice of career in part to her early years of experimenting with the \u201ctrusty white glue stick\u201d.", "It\u2019s difficult to conceive of a time before Pritt, but in 1967, when a Henkel researcher, Dr Wolfgang Dierichs, came up with the idea, there were no solid glues on the market. \u201cThe trick was getting the glue to stiffen,\u201d says Nils Hellwig, head of global product development, adhesive consumers and craftsmen at Henkel.", "Scientists finally settled on the combination of a soap gel \u2013 which made the substance solid \u2013 and a water-soluble adhesive. \u201cOnce the stick is rubbed on, say, paper, the adhesive components of the water-soluble glue compound are released to work their sticky magic,\u201d says Hellwig.", "And so, after two years of experimentation, the lipstick-inspired, no-mess product found its way into children\u2019s eager hands in 1969. The rest is history \u2013 well, almost.", "There was still room for improvement. \u201cIn 1991, Henkel started the process of switching from petroleum-based PVP glue sticks to plant-based solutions,\u201d says Hellwig, adding that the use of PVP led to high CO2 emissions.", "There\u2019s been no PVP in Pritt since 2000, with natural starch compounds taking its place, and since 2012 that starch has come from a homegrown \u201cindustrial\u201d potato. \u201cIt\u2019s planted in Germany and the modified starch is also produced in Germany,\u201d says Hellwig. \u201cShorter transportation distances lower the product\u2019s CO2 emissions.\u201d", "Solvite, another Henkel product, also harnesses the sticking qualities of potato starch, as Paul Barney, technical services manager at Henkel UK, explains. \u201cSolvite wallpaper adhesive flakes are produced by the chemical modification of sidestream potato starch \u2013 starch that is recovered from the process water generated during the production of crisps and chips, then purified to produce pure potato starch.\u201d", "Barney points out that because the starch is a byproduct of another process \u2013 rather than from potatoes grown specifically for their starch \u2013 any environmental impact is attributed to the primary product (in this case, crisps and chips).", "He adds that the chemical modification of Solvite gives it certain qualities it would otherwise not have \u2013 such as resistance to mould and strong adhesion \u2013 but without making it hazardous to the environment.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Generations of children have grown up crafting with Pritt sticks. Photograph: Arina Habich/Alamy", "Solvite\u2019s sheer stickiness is something people of a certain age can never forget. Back when having three television channels in colour seemed like unimaginable riches, the spectacle of a man suspended on a board from a helicopter, with only a thin film of glue to hold him there, kept generations enthralled during advert breaks.", "\u201cI was a young lad when that advert came out, but it really stuck in my mind,\u201d says Bromley-based painter and decorator Simon Palmer. \u201cLater, when I started hanging wallpaper, I realised they weren\u2019t wrong.\u201d", "Solvite first went on sale in 1964 in Fylde, on the Lancashire coast, as a product for professional painters and decorators, but as the DIY market took root, and people began eyeing their dated walls with a new sense of potential, it also became the home-enthusiast\u2019s favourite.", "Palmer put this down to its strength and ease of use. \u201cSome adhesives go lumpy even when stirred well, and the adhesion is nowhere near as good \u2013 the paper can curl up at the edges,\u201d he says. \u201cSolvite mixes into a smooth paste you can work with in less than two minutes. And when it\u2019s time to strip a wall, with a decent steamer the paper comes off easily \u2013 no heavy scraping.\u201d", "A national brand within the decade, Solvite was acquired by Henkel in 1973. Today, the Solvite range comprises a variety of powder and premixed adhesives, to suit every wallpaper material. You can even opt to paste the wall rather than the paper, which speeds up the process, reduces the risk of tearing, and does away with the need for a pasting table \u2013 if you have the right wallpaper.", "Although the Pritt family has also expanded, to incorporate an all-purpose glue (1972), correction and adhesive rollers (1989), and kids\u2019 craft sets (2015), among others, it\u2019s the original stick that inspires a sense of devotion among its fans.", "\u201cI remember those Christmas angels, those dinosaurs made from toilet rolls covered with scraps of paper, the mawkish grins of red wool and googly eyes,\u201d says sculptor Simon Bosworth, from south London. \u201cThey were all held in place by that mighty stick.\u201d", "Profits and pandemics: how industry is showing its social conscience Read more", "Although he undoubtedly sees some of Pritt\u2019s benefits through a parent\u2019s eyes \u2013 \u201cno rushing to A&E with a toddler whose lips are stuck together\u201d \u2013 it has a place in his craft too. \u201cI still use it when making a paper maquette. Maybe, when I\u2019m famous, those early pieces, held together by that versatile glue stick, will make it into a gallery.\u201d", "Pritt has been to more exotic places still. On 17 March 2001, Russian cosmonaut Yury Usachev, commander of the international space station (ISS), took off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan with a cargo of Pritt products for use aboard the station. They were tested in zero-gravity conditions \u2013 and passed.", "For Ahmed, who cherishes the \u201ccutting and sticking degree\u201d conferred to her as a child by her parents, Pritt is not just a household name, but a household necessity. \u201cI bulk buy now and I have a slight panic when we\u2019re down to the last stick,\u201d she says.", "Given that Henkel\u2019s Dusseldorf factory sometimes produces more than 200,000 sticks a day, and that global production of the solvent-free, PVC-free glue stick stands at 120m sticks a year, she\u2019s clearly not alone."], "authors": ["Sam Noble"], "keywords": ["place", "potato", "starch", "pritt", "waste", "product", "power", "stick", "spuds", "solvite", "henkel", "keeping", "sticks", "nations", "paper", "glue", "wallpaper"], "pubDate": "2020-09-11T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
