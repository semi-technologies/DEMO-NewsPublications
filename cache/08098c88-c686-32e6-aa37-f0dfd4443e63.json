They discovered that by crossing two inbred strains they could create seeds that would consistently grow better than either of the parent plants. It was the beginning of a seed revolution. By the 1940s American agricultural productivity was shooting up; by the 1960s Asia had joined the race, thanks to improved varieties of rice and wheat.", "In most of the world, the green revolution continues. Open an American seed catalogue today and you will see dozens of varieties of each plant, many of them labelled \u201cnew\u201d to show that they have been released or improved somehow just in the past year.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "But on one continent, it never quite happened. African farmers still tend to use open-pollinated seeds held back from the previous year\u2019s crop or commercial hybrids that were developed years ago. That\u2019s one of the main reasons for the continent\u2019s chronically low productivity. The average field planted with maize\u2014Africa\u2019s most important crop, which supplies 30% of people\u2019s calories in some countries\u2014yields a third as much as a Chinese maize field of the same size and just a fifth as much as an American one.", "The problem is not a paucity of science. Although crop research in Africa is not as well funded as it is in rich countries, there is enough public and private investment to ensure a stream of new seeds to suit local soils and climates. Nor is the problem ideology. African governments have mostly ignored the arguments, from some charities, that old-fashioned farming is best and that wicked, profit-seeking seed firms should be barred. They know that modern seeds make farming more productive.", "The problem is that government policies prevent farmers from getting good seeds. Many insist on lengthy field trials and obstruct the approval of seeds that have already been certified for planting elsewhere. As a result, those on the market are always several years behind the scientific cutting edge. It need not be so. Zambia has liberalised its certification system, including by allowing seed companies to inspect themselves. In the past two decades, maize productivity there has doubled.", "Although Africa\u2019s governments have mostly got out of the seed-production business, governments often subsidise seeds and former state monopolies still dominate the seed trade (see article). They flood markets with seeds that are often of poor quality or unsuited to local conditions, crowding out more efficient private distributors with better goods.", "It is not a bad idea for governments to subsidise seeds to persuade farmers to try productive varieties for the first time. But that should be the limit. State resources would be better spent on research, on tackling counterfeit seeds\u2014a big problem in many countries\u2014or on educating farmers about how to use improved seeds and fertiliser. Ethiopia, though not a paragon of market openness, has done that well. Its maize fields are now almost twice as productive as the African average."], "url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/09/26/africas-farmers-need-better-seeds", "title": "Africa\u2019s farmers need better seeds", "pubDate": null, "keywords": ["seed", "farmers", "varieties", "governments", "crop", "american", "problem", "better", "need", "maize", "seeds", "productivity", "africas"]}
