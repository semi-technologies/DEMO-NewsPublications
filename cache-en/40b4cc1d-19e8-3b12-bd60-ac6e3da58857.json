This was December, the month when traditionally I can no longer outrun the clerical tasks that have stalked me since the middle of the year. I had weeks of crinkled receipts to expense: the year-end tax on negligence. I was halfway through the process of contesting the charge on a vaccine shot that my insurance company had refused to cover, and I had to transcribe hours of interviews before I could begin to write\u2014the only use of my time which generates an income. As a moonless night wore on, filled with snacking and monsters, I futzed with the formulas in my sad expense spreadsheets and knew that these were hours of life I\u2019d never get back.", "In the matter of assistant-having, I was not (as Titian might have said of Venus) without models. My introduction came the first time I answered a peer\u2019s e-mail and realized with a start that we were not alone. \u201cJulianne can help us find a time,\u201d my correspondent wrote. Who? But here was this unknown person in the CC field, suddenly at my side like an attendant bearing Q-tips in a German men\u2019s room. I felt betrayed and then, immediately, envious. Tuesday or Wednesday? Why didn\u2019t I have one of these e-mail lurkers? I reflected for a moment and remembered that I couldn\u2019t afford one.", "This made me doubly a loser. People usually get recognized and elevated for the achievements they have time to make, not for the hours they spend maintaining filing systems. One answer to the primal question about Wonder Women and Men\u2014how do they do it?\u2014comes down to help: bookkeepers, housecleaners, lawyers, strategists, and nannies. Many of the best have managed thus. Mark Twain, not thought to be a highfalutin man, enjoyed the help of a private secretary and a butler (named Claude). Mother Teresa had personal assistants (her good deeds seemingly did not extend to paperwork), and Malcolm X depended on a secretary whom he\u2019d hired away from this magazine. Highly effective people may share certain habits, but what they usually share more generously are tasks that get in the way of their being highly effective.", "Odd, then, that, in an age of harried two-income households, assistantship is on the wane. Over the past twenty years, the number of people in the U.S. employed as executive secretaries and administrative assistants has more than halved, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which expects assistantship across industries to decline nine per cent by 2029. In part, that\u2019s due to changes in the nature of the work: bits of what a secretary would have done thirty years ago are handled today by technology and by jobs with different titles. But the shift is economic, too. Assistance positions are often among the first to go when companies cut costs, and financially strapped middle-class workers have less to spend on help outside the office, even if they need it more.", "The problem of efficiency, productivity, and how to make a market out of some but not really enough disposable income is an obvious target for startup tech, and the brigades have already come through. \u201cIf you think about what exists in the movie \u2018Her\u2019 or \u2018Iron Man\u2019\u2014a super-powerful assistant service that knows you and takes care of the world around you\u2014it\u2019s a really healing version of the future,\u201d the entrepreneur and venture capitalist Sam Lessin told me not long ago. In 2015, he co-founded a company, called Fin, that released a virtual-assistant app with actual humans on the other end. The competition was weak; the closest most of us have got to \u201cHer\u201d is Siri (a known moron), Alexa (a known snoop), or that officious paper clip from the nineties. But Fin, like other companies, ultimately gave up on virtual assistance (it now does data analytics), because the business turned out to be hard. People anticipate human error from human assistants, but from tech they want perfection. And the model was strained by employee management. \u201cYou end up hiring thousands and thousands of people to get the scale,\u201d Lessin said.", "Faced with personnel challenges, some assistance startups have turned to poor nations abroad. A wage that\u2019s illegal in the United States will keep you well fed in Kenya, American entrepreneurs have noticed. Lately, some companies have sought to shift the burdens of a struggling American middle class to workers in Africa, South America, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and elsewhere. To manage the mundane tasks of their narrow worlds, the thinking goes, small businesses and busy parents can turn to the wider one.", "One of those companies is Invisible Technologies, which launched in 2015 and now has staff in thirty-five countries, from Malaysia to Ghana, Serbia to Pakistan. It emerged in part from the idea that great savings can be harvested from the developing world. \u201cLabor is incredibly cheap, and the biggest arbitrage opportunity in the world is the fact that you\u2019ve got the largest labor market in history, with people who are connected to the Internet, speak English, and have amazing attitudes,\u201d Francis Pedraza, Invisible\u2019s thirty-one-year-old C.E.O. and founder, told me. \u201cThe ability to tap into that and create things is infinite.\u201d", "Besides these savings, Invisible grew from two ideas, one about bigness and the other about smallness. The bigness idea was that processes in a business or a life ought to be managed by one entity\u2014a virtual super-assistant who can deal with anything. The smallness idea was that complex processes can be broken down and run in bits. Pedraza\u2019s inspiration, on the latter point, was Henry Ford. \u201cEvery year, the price of Ford motor cars kept dropping and the quality kept improving,\u201d he said. The key was separating production into simple tasks, such as screwing in a single lug nut, and then snapping those tasks together like Legos on the factory floor, allowing processes to be built without hiring new teams, then tightened to the inch.", "Pedraza has brown hair, streamlined into a short crop; a long, chiselled face; and a predilection for what he calls \u201cbooks by dead people.\u201d (\u201cYou should distrust the New York Times best-seller in the airport bookshelf,\u201d he told me. \u201cTrust \u2018Self-Reliance,\u2019 by Ralph Waldo Emerson, because people are still reading Emerson today.\u201d) When I met him, he had just heard of Philip Roth for the first time, possibly because Roth had recently been alive. Some of Pedraza\u2019s colleagues amiably call him crazy. He is known for saying uncommon things in surprising ways. \u201cIdeas are almost like aliens trying to come into the real world, and we\u2019re just pregnant with them,\u201d he has said. He has published more than two thousand essays on his Medium blog, and during this summer of unrest he wrote against \u201csilencing all disagreement as evidence of oppression\u201d\u2014a position that he also claimed for Socrates, Diogenes, Tiresias, the Jewish prophets, Martin Luther, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Pedraza keeps a Roman gladius in his closet, for athletic practice, and speaks of \u201chuman potential\u201d in the way some people talk about their favorite football team. He sees Invisible as a tool for realizing that potential by breaking past the clutter of modern life; he describes the company\u2019s workflow as a \u201cdigital assembly line.\u201d", "Compared with sprawling labor-for-hire marketplaces like the site Upwork, where users enlist jobbers for specific tasks such as copywriting or data processing, Invisible is about order and scale. Most of the assistance it does is for entire companies. For businesses of one\u2014say, a hapless writer\u2014it offers an \u201cexecutive support\u201d service, which connects an individual with a virtual character to whom he or she can assign wishes and tasks.", "Pedraza named his own assistant character John Keats, for his favorite dead poet. The character is not puppeted by one person: behind him is a team of people, which, unlike a real assistant, can do an endless number of things at once. When Pedraza includes John Keats\u2019s address on an e-mail\u2014for example, an e-mail about meeting with me\u2014a hidden system moves into action. One meeting is broken into multiple tasks, appearing in a queue on the company\u2019s proprietary delegation software, where they are claimed by workers around the world. Someone in, say, Bangladesh goes into Pedraza\u2019s Google calendar to find times; someone else, maybe a few continents away, in Guatemala, compiles a briefing memo about the participants. Often, in Pedraza\u2019s case, the tasks are not strictly professional. He recently had John Keats book him an elaborate laser hair-removal procedure he\u2019d been hoping to get. (\u201cThere was some, you know, confusion about what, uh, areas were covered by this,\u201d he said. \u201cInvisible just handled it for me.\u201d) Sometimes, he has John Keats trawl through his first- and second-degree connections on LinkedIn for contacts who might be interested in Invisible, and begin corresponding with them from his e-mail account, under his name. Some express interest, and meetings are set up. Until Pedraza goes to those, the whole process churns on like a software update in the background of his life. He likes to sign his e-mails (or someone does) \u201cEfficiently yours.\u201d", "The average pay for foreign workers at Invisible\u2014known as \u201cagents\u201d\u2014is five dollars an hour. High-performing agents can make up to ten. \u201cWe are gathering all of their training data, all of their performance data,\u201d Pedraza told me. Agents are monitored in an endless screen share, with superiors looking over their shoulders all the time to see what they\u2019re doing and how long it\u2019s taking. Instead of replacing humans in slow parts of the assembly line with robots (Ford\u2019s practice), the company writes software to speed through rote steps once they\u2019re set.", "\u201cGive in and buy a space heater.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by P. C. Vey", "Offshore outsourcing, which included more than fourteen million workers in 2018, has been linked to unemployment and wage stagnation in the American workforce: it\u2019s harder to get a raise if your competition abroad works for much less. Pedraza often boasts that Invisible, which hires six per cent of applicants, is more selective than Harvard. At the moment, in fact, Harvard\u2019s acceptance rate is five per cent, and many people go there because it is thought to open wormholes to the world of the \u00e9lite, while most agents at Invisible simply want a decent job.", "Once, it was big companies such as Nike or Google that did most outsourcing. But today the practice appeals to small businesses weathering COVID-19. Invisible\u2019s revenue has more than tripled since the beginning of the year, and its agents in the developing world now handle some of the clerical work involved in setting restaurants up on several of the largest food-delivery platforms. We hear a lot about changes to the American labor market during the pandemic, but this one is likely to linger when it ends."], "authors": ["Nathan Heller", "Nathan Helle"], "keywords": ["invisible", "workers", "outsource", "pedrazas", "todo", "list", "world", "pedraza", "life", "data", "told", "tasks", "companies"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
