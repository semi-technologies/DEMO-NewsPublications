That update, entitled 15.10, dropped today in advance of Monster Hunter Rise\u2019s 2021 release. So, while everyone is gearing up to clear any limited-time modes they might\u2019ve missed over the years, I\u2019ll be in my element: Alone; among the rustling forests, echoing canyons, and frozen prairies of the New World.", "Monster Hunter: World was an unexpected gift from my best friend. He\u2019d been playing Capcom\u2019s famed action/RPG franchise for as long as I could remember. I wasn\u2019t particularly impressed by his explanations of the series\u2019 age-old gameplay loop. Even so, I spent half of Monster Hunter: World\u2019s launch day tinkering with its character creator. Soon, my avatar \u201cSpider Face \u201d was born, and together we spent hundreds of hours conducting field research expeditions and, ultimately, vanquishing the game\u2019s mighty fauna. If I wasn\u2019t compiling the best bow builds or crafting legendary armor sets, I was likely meditating beneath the hanging crystals of the Elder\u2019s Recess or sprinting through flower meadows in the Wildspire Waste.", "You see, Monster Hunter: World was the game I desperately needed back in 2018. Post-grad depression and a long stretch of unemployment ripped my self-confidence and optimism to shreds. Most days, I couldn\u2019t find the energy to get out of bed, eat, or talk to anyone. Family members suggested therapy and offered emotional support. Still, I had convinced myself that everything was fine. I was just going through a temporary phase. I was sure that, one day, I\u2019d wake up to a miraculous email or phone call from some prominent game studio or publishing house, exhale, and feel like I had value again. Of course, that never happened because I was too defeated to apply anywhere. Eventually, I decided that job-searching wasn\u2019t worth the trouble because I wasn\u2019t good enough. During the waking hours of each day, these dark thoughts tormented me, and so sleep became a lifeline.", "There\u2019s nothing quite like preparing for a momentous battle in Monster Hunter: World. You equip items with skills that complement your specific playstyle, craft throwables and consumables from collected ingredients, and then, like any savvy hunter, grab a meal at the canteen for status buffs and game-changing perks. Despite being an archer, I loved positioning Spider Face at the frontline so we could lead the charge and deal devastating damage up close. Luckily, amid the various biomes of the New World, the fears and self-doubts that echoed in my mind were nonexistent. I was too busy drawing Tempered Kushala Daora\u2019s attention so that my squad could heal and place bombs or traps. Whenever I let that final arrow fly and watched each beast \u2013 likely mid-jump \u2013 fall back to the earth in slow motion, I felt so accomplished. For just a few seconds, the win screen in a video game meant everything to me.", "One year (and 600 in-game hours) later, I was a high-level hunter showing newcomers the ropes. I also exhausted Monster Hunter: World\u2019s end-game content by grinding each tempered elder dragon for better bows and gear. More importantly, I was freely talking and goofing off with friends. Life was good. Somewhere between the handler\u2019s constant ruminations, the Bazelgeuse\u2019s disorienting airstrikes, and each mission\u2019s victory fanfare, I found small reasons to be happy again. Mastering the bow class, handily navigating every labyrinthine environment, and meticulously preparing for monster encounters paralleled my mission to overcome depression and become productive. Even when I no longer needed Monster Hunter: World to feel courageous or important, I carried its emotional impact with me to job fairs and interviews.", "By the time Iceborne launched during the final quarter of 2019, my monster-hunting tenure as Spider Face, the battle-hardened marksman, had already come to an end. Nevertheless, I dove into the expansion to see its new locales and get trampled by its dangerous monsters. Traveling to the gathering hub and watching dozens of hunters \u2013 amateurs and veterans alike \u2013 set out on quests together brought a smile to my face. It was nice to know that large-scale events were frequent, and a dedicated fanbase still existed.", "Monster Hunter: World will endure, but Version 15.10 is a sad reminder that this is the end of post-launch content. Monster Hunter Rise is just around the corner and enticing as ever. As I get reacquainted with Monster Hunter: World\u2019s UI and attempt to fight monsters from older updates, I can\u2019t help but feel as if a bittersweet farewell is in order. Yes, the online servers will still be around. And my elder dragon nemesis, Kirin, will forever wander the reefs of the Coral Highlands, waiting for me to notch an arrow and strike, but things are different. I\u2019m different. Of course, there are times when I feel low, unsure of myself and my place in the world, but I\u2019ve learned how to bounce back \u2013 and my experiences in the New World played a part in that.", "I\u2019m choosing to say goodbye to Monster Hunter: World because it feels like the right time. Through perseverance and a lot of wishful thinking, I\u2019m attending my dream grad school while writing about the games that have molded me into the person I am today. Sure, I don\u2019t need to be Spider Face to feel strong, but maybe logging back in every now and then \u2013 for nostalgia\u2019s sake \u2013 couldn\u2019t hurt."], "authors": ["Associate Editor", "Jay Is A Jrpg Enthusiast", "Having Clocked In Thousands Of Hours In Franchises Like Final Fantasy", "Monster Hunter.
