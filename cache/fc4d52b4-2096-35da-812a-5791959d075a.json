The 10-part series, written and directed by Hannah Fidell based on her 2013 film of the same name, mirrors Hulu\u2019s similarly paced Normal People in its his-and-hers perspectives of a formative, inescapable relationship, but with an uncomfortably ruinous core.", "The Undoing review \u2013 Hugh Grant and Nicole Kidman start to unravel Read more", "Over 20-25 minute episodes, A Teacher shows us what should seem to be a transparent case of grooming: Claire (Kate Mara), a quiet, deceptively self-destructive new high school English teacher in Austin, Texas, and her 17-year-old student-turned-lover, Eric (Love Simon\u2019s Nick Robinson). Given the clear transgression of its premise, A Teacher is playing with fire, and it knows it \u2013 the show is sandwiched in warnings about grooming and resources for help, including the national hotline for RAINN; Mara filmed a PSA on sexual abuse prior to the show\u2019s release. But the series blazes ahead with flammable material, occasionally getting burned in the process. At its best, A Teacher is a taut, uncomfortably absorptive portrait of obsession, a brisk yet grounded escape into the murky depths of a relationship that smartly, especially for Eric, reflects on the cold shadow of what he\u2019s experienced. But the show\u2019s good intentions and intentional discomfort \u2013 you will, at some point, root for Eric and Claire \u2013 gets undercut by its own intoxicating sleekness.", "A Teacher traces a fast-paced arc: the first five episodes plunge into their attraction, as Claire, stifled in her marriage to a doting but aloof musician, Matt (Ashley Zukerman), and friend-less at work besides fellow teacher Kathryn (Marielle Scott) escalates inappropriate out-of-school tutoring sessions with Eric to sexual trysts. The back half of the season, following the relationship\u2019s exposure, traces the transgression\u2019s long shadow, as Claire reels from scandal and responsibility, and a haunted Eric, alienated by an experience few understand, attempts to move on.", "On paper, the relationship between Claire and Eric is clearly, unmistakably manipulative. As filmed, especially with the baby-faced but still 25-year-old Robinson in the lead role, their relationship \u2013 fleeting scenes of inexorable attraction, delicate closeups of clandestine car hookups, love scenes sound-tracked to a cover of Rihanna\u2019s Stay \u2013 is communicated as sexy, alluring. That is the case no matter the warnings attached to each episode, and that remains the case when the show\u2019s final episode attempts to flip the script on the dynamic of mutual attraction portrayed in the season\u2019s first half; without spoilers, the show\u2019s conclusion, as Claire and especially Eric reckon with the damage of what\u2019s happened between them, skitters incompletely on the surface, an attempt to freight one\u2019s hook of an illicit relationship with moral consequences that leave too much unseen and unsaid.", "Which is not to say the show is unsatisfactory, generative, sharper than it should be; A Teacher has one of the most micro-generationally on-point scenes of a high school party \u2013 it\u2019s set in 2013-2014, so the early years of Snapchat, second year of Instagram, the playlist distinctly fall 2012 \u2013 of anything I\u2019ve seen on TV. The liberal use of a phone screen, running adjacent to the character stewing over it, effectively grounds Eric and Claire\u2019s relationship in the all-too-real arena of digital pining; when Claire hovers over accepting Eric\u2019s Instagram request, it has palpable stakes. The very familiar aesthetic of iPhone lock screens pin the timeline of Eric and Claire\u2019s relationship down to the minute. Six weeks of involvement, the show reveals, can cost years.", "Robinson, as Eric, is as convincing as an emotionally chaotic, confused teen as a 25-year-old can be, even if his casting never allows the queasiness of the age gap to really land. Mara plays Claire as mostly inscrutable, and though there is much to imagine in the show\u2019s spareness, the gaps \u2013 what compelled Claire? Had she done this before, or thought about it? How did she justify it? \u2013 make the second half\u2019s reckoning feel incomplete.", "A charitable reading of this show, which after inhaling and then rewatching it, I am inclined to give, would be that A Teacher offers a more nuanced than expected portrait of how, for Eric, one\u2019s understanding of complicity, truth and blame morph over time, and how our culture is poorly equipped to identify grooming, especially when the groomer is a woman; the show wisely follows Eric into his freshman year at University of Texas, where he is hailed as a legend by frat bros who demand details on Claire\u2019s boob size.", "In other words, there are plenty of hooks in A Teacher \u2013 its pace, sparse portrayal of intoxication, and an especially adept performance by Robinson will likely allow viewers to map their own obsessions and illicit thrills on to the show\u2019s limited run-time. The confusion over how, exactly, we\u2019re supposed to feel about Eric and Claire\u2019s attraction, is certainly provocative, but also short-circuiting. There is plenty of room to get lost in A Teacher; I just wish it saved more for redemption."], "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "keywords": ["case", "drama", "eric", "relationship", "especially", "review", "claire", "teacher", "shows", "attraction", "incomplete", "grooming", "intriguing", "claires"], "pubDate": "2020-11-08T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
