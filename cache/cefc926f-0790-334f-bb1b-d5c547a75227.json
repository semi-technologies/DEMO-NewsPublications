This tidbit caused a stir. If true, this would mean Harry would be heading back to the U.K. for the first time since making his last official appearance at the Commonwealth Day service on March 9.", "Then came the follow-up questions: Why is he going back? (Some suggested he was going to talk to the queen after the couple received pushback for discussing voter registration for the 2020 election.) When is he going back? Was this an imminent trip\u2014for the holidays, or in January? And who is he going back with? Inquirers wondered whether the duchess and their young son, Archie, would return as well.", "First things first: Splitting time between California and the U.K. was always the plan for Harry and Meghan. \u201cWe now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America,\u201d the couple said in their stepping-down statement on January 8. \u201cThis geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter.\u201d Under ordinary circumstances, we would have likely seen Harry and Meghan back in London even earlier. But the pandemic canceled such large gatherings, and also made air travel inadvisable.", "\u201cThere have been a lot of rumors circulating about this. Had it not been for COVID and travel restrictions, they would have already been back in the U.K. For events like Beatrice\u2019s wedding and Trooping of the Colour, for example,\u201d a source close to the couple tells Vogue. So their return was, well, inevitable. Especially now that an overseas visit is more doable\u2014the United States and the U.K. are reportedly developing a safer travel corridor between the two countries.", "The couple also may have a set reason for returning sooner rather than later: Markle\u2019s court case against the publisher of The Mail on Sunday. The case\u2014which in the past few months has been in the pretrial phase\u2014officially begins on January 11, 2021, and lasts 10 days. According to a report in Vanity Fair, the couple will return before the start of the trial as they need to undergo a two-week quarantine after traveling to the U.K. from America. That means the couple would need to leave the U.S. in late December.", "It\u2019ll likely be both a poignant and pained reunion for the couple and the royal family, who haven\u2019t seen each other in person since March. Since then, much has changed: Harry and Meghan announced a Netflix deal, bought their first home, and paid back the public for Frogmore Cottage. What will their relationship with the royal family look like once they\u2019re back on the same side of the pond?
