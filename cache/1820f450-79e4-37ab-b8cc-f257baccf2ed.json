Everyone has been talking about it, but what does it all mean?", "In 2012, I proposed the term \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d to describe the point where quantum computers can do things that classical computers can\u2019t, regardless of whether those tasks are useful. With that new term, I wanted to emphasize that this is a privileged time in the history of our planet, when information technologies based on principles of quantum physics are ascendant.", "Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research develop\u00adments and trends in mathe\u00admatics and the physical and life sciences.", "The words \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d\u2014if not the concept\u2014proved to be controversial for two reasons. One is that supremacy, through its association with white supremacy, evokes a repugnant political stance. The other reason is that the word exacerbates the already overhyped reporting on the status of quantum technology. I anticipated the second objection but failed to foresee the first. In any case, the term caught on, and it has been embraced with particular zeal by the Google AI Quantum team.", "I considered but rejected several other possibilities, deciding that quantum supremacy best captured the point I wanted to convey. One alternative is \u201cquantum advantage,\u201d which is also now widely used. But to me, \u201cadvantage\u201d lacks the punch of \u201csupremacy.\u201d In a race, a horse has an advantage if it wins by a nose. In contrast, the speed of a quantum computer vastly exceeds that of classical computers, for certain tasks. At least, that\u2019s true in principle.", "The recent Google paper illustrates the point. They used a device with 53 qubits (the quantum analogues of a classical computer\u2019s bits), and they report that it took just minutes to perform quantum computations that would take today\u2019s most powerful supercomputers thousands of years. Assuming it\u2019s true, this is a remarkable achievement in experimental physics and a testament to the brisk pace of progress in quantum computing hardware; I offer my hearty congratulations to everyone involved.", "LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Quantum Computing", "The catch, as the Google team acknowledges, is that the problem their machine solved with astounding speed was carefully chosen just for the purpose of demonstrating the quantum computer\u2019s superiority. It is not otherwise a problem of much practical interest. In brief, the quantum computer executed a randomly chosen sequence of instructions, and then all the qubits were measured to produce an output bit string. This quantum computation has very little structure, which makes it harder for the classical computer to keep up, but it also means the answer is not very informative.", "However, the demonstration is still significant. By checking that the output of their quantum computer agrees with the output of a classical supercomputer (in cases where it doesn\u2019t take thousands of years), the team has verified that they understand their device and that it performs as it should. Now that we know the hardware is working, we can begin the search for more useful applications.", "Why is it so important to verify the performance of the hardware? It\u2019s because precisely controlling a quantum computer is notoriously difficult. In a sense, merely looking at a quantum system unavoidably disturbs it, a manifestation of Heisenberg\u2019s famous uncertainty principle. So if we want to use such a system to store and reliably process information, we need to keep that system nearly perfectly isolated from the outside world. At the same time, though, we want the qubits to interact with one another so we can process the information; we also need to control the system from the outside and eventually measure the qubits to learn the results of our computations. It is quite challenging to build a quantum system that satisfies all of these desiderata, and it has taken many years of progress in materials, fabrication, design, and control to get where we are now.", "The quantum supremacy milestone allegedly achieved by Google is a pivotal step in the quest for practical quantum computers. I thought it would be useful to have a word for the era that is now dawning, so I recently made one up: NISQ. (It rhymes with risk.) This stands for \u201cnoisy intermediate-scale quantum.\u201d Here \u201cintermediate-scale\u201d refers to the size of quantum computers that are now becoming available: potentially large enough to perform certain highly specialized tasks beyond the reach of today\u2019s supercomputers. \u201cNoisy\u201d emphasizes that we have imperfect control over the qubits, resulting in small errors that accumulate over time; if we attempt too long a computation, we\u2019re not likely to get the right answer."], "url": "https://wired.com/story/why-i-coined-the-term-quantum-supremacy/", "keywords": ["classical", "quantum", "coined", "google", "qubits", "computer", "computers", "useful", "term", "system", "supremacy"], "summary": "A recent paper from Google\u2019s quantum computing lab announced that the company had achieved quantum supremacy.\nIn 2012, I proposed the term \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d to describe the point where quantum computers can do things that classical computers can\u2019t, regardless of whether those tasks are useful.\nI considered but rejected several other possibilities, deciding that quantum supremacy best captured the point I wanted to convey.\nIn a sense, merely looking at a quantum system unavoidably disturbs it, a manifestation of Heisenberg\u2019s famous uncertainty principle.\nThe quantum supremacy milestone allegedly achieved by Google is a pivotal step in the quest for practical quantum computers."}
