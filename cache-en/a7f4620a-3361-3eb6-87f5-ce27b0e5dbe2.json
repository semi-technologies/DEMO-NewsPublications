For obstructors of justice and launderers of foreign cash, the waning days of the Trump Administration might as well be the Super Bowl. Historically, this end-of-term bonanza has been the domain of a privileged guilty few, with the general public cut out of the action. But times change. Recently, a man named Pat Morrow surveyed the scene and thought, What if I gave you two-to-one odds on Giuliani?", "Rudy Giuliani and Paul Manafort Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "Morrow runs the odds-making operation at Bovada, an online sports book. This year, with the N.C.A.A. Tournament cancelled and the Olympics postponed, Bovada has cleaned up on political wagering. It has allowed bets on everything from Biden\u2019s running mate (Kamala Harris led for weeks) to which word Trump would say first at a post-election press conference (\u201cfraud\u201d and \u201csteal\u201d lost to \u201ccount,\u201d a heavy underdog). \u201cIf you are a patriotic American concerned about the electoral process, that\u2019s kind of depressing,\u201d Morrow said, of the press-conference bet. \u201cBut it got great engagement.\u201d", "The latest action is on Bovada\u2019s pardon market. From the start, the former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort has been the favorite to receive a pardon, at minus 400 (a winner must bet four hundred bucks on him in order to make a hundred). He is trailed by the campaign advisers George Papadopoulos (minus 325) and Rick Gates (minus 300). When setting lines for events like a Mets game, Bovada uses stats and probabilities. But for pardons, Morrow said, \u201cwe really just went through a Who\u2019s Who of people who are in trouble, and who have some kind of connection to Trump.\u201d He added, \u201cWho would be in his best interest? Bannon makes sense, Gates makes sense, Manafort really, really, really makes sense.\u201d For those looking for a potential dark horse, Julian Assange is plus 250: a hundred-dollar wager would net two hundred and fifty. \u201cGhislaine Maxwell\u2019s at three to one,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably not fair. I would recommend not betting that.\u201d", "Getting in on the pardon game requires a working knowledge of constitutional law. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if we wanted to put Trump himself as an option, because there\u2019s still some legal discussion as to whether that\u2019s possible,\u201d Morrow said. Trump made the cut as a plus-160 dog. Initially, his three eldest children did not. \u201cWe thought he did not have the power to do it,\u201d Morrow said. But, when the Times reported that Trump was, in fact, discussing the matter with advisers, the lines went up. They\u2019re currently plus 130. Jared Kushner is plus 150.", "Rudy Giuliani posed another quandary. Can a President pre\u00ebmptively pardon someone who hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime? Giuliani began as a bargain, plus 240. \u201cThat one was probably a mistake on our side,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cI personally didn\u2019t price this one. I would suggest that perhaps the trader behind it was thinking that, as it currently stands, Rudy doesn\u2019t have any indictments pending.\u201d Bettors hammered the line all the way down to plus 140. Giuliani is now the most popular wager on the board. Trump is second.", "The election itself accounted for a quarter of Bovada\u2019s 2020 revenue. (\u201cIt was bigger than Mayweather-McGregor!\u201d Morrow said.) About two-thirds of the money was on Trump, though most savvy bettors, or sharps, bet Biden. The Biden bettors were paid only after the votes were certified. Morrow is now concerned about the tiny chance that the certifications will be overturned; he\u2019d have to pay out the Trump wagers, too. \u201cBut, in the grand scheme of things, what\u2019s a quarter of a year\u2019s revenue versus, you know, the republic being torn apart?\u201d Morrow asked. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of given me a weird bit of peace.\u201d", "How are the sharps approaching pardons? Gadoon Kyrollos, a prominent professional gambler who goes by Spanky, recommended betting against the news. That strategy returned a big profit for him on Election Night. The market went crazy after Trump, then the underdog, won Florida. \u201cI was trading until 4 a.m.,\u201d Spanky said. \u201cTrump was a three-to-one favorite. When I wake up, Trump becomes a three-to-one dog. And then, by 7 p.m., that became a ten- or fifteen-to-one underdog. You never see movement like that. That\u2019s once in a lifetime. Almost like last weekend\u2019s Jets game. Although that might have been on purpose.\u201d", "Despite the windfall, Spanky and his partners are sitting out the pardon market. \u201cIf we\u2019re not getting down fifty, a hundred thousand a game, we\u2019re really not into it,\u201d he said. Plus, it\u2019s personal. Eight years ago, Spanky was pinched in a gambling bust. He maintains that he was simply a bettor (legal), but that the large sums he was moving convinced the police that he must be a bookie (illegal). He pleaded guilty to avoid a trial. Officially, he\u2019s a felon. Earlier this year, he petitioned both Trump and Andrew Cuomo, on Twitter, for a pardon. \u201cI\u2019m a hundred to one,\u201d Spanky said. \u2666"], "authors": ["Zach Helfand", "Zach Helfan"], "keywords": ["really", "trump", "went", "giuliani", "odds", "plus", "morrow", "pardon", "thats", "game", "spanky", "pardons"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
