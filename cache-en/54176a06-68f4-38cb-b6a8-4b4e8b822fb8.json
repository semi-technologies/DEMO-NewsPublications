It is January 3rd 1911, and in place of the block of flats with black railings stands a redbrick Victorian terrace. Just after dawn, policemen throw pebbles at a second-floor window. From inside comes a volley of bullets\u2014the opening shots in six hours of mayhem. A sergeant collapses, struck in the chest.", "So began the Siege of Sidney Street, a pyrotechnic showdown that sparked headlines and manhunts around the world. The anxieties it dramatised\u2014over immigrants, extremism and the welcome both receive in London\u2014remain acute today. So do the questions it raised about violence by and against the police, and over the perils of political grandstanding, in this case by Winston Churchill, then home secretary in Britain\u2019s Liberal government.", "In one of history\u2019s arbitrary ricochets, the events paired Churchill with another figure destined to become a legend: a revolutionary known as Peter the Painter, once notorious from Canada to Australia yet so shadowy and elusive that some doubt he ever existed. Unfolding over a chilly Christmas season, the episode shows how villains can turn into heroes, flaws become virtues, and the past morph into myth.", "In an urban landscape transformed by slum clearances and the Luftwaffe, you have to look hard for traces of this sensational affair. But they are there. A mile to the west of Sidney Street in Devonshire Square is a plaque honouring Robert Bentley, Charles Tucker and Walter Choate, police officers slain in the line of duty. This is where the story begins.", "Their killers included veterans of prison breaks and guerrilla warfare in modern-day Latvia, victims of tsarist torture who expected the same treatment if they were caught again. In London they inhabited a milieu of radical ideas and exiles (including, a few years earlier, Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky). In their correspondence, obtained by police and kept in the London Metropolitan Archives ( LMA ), the desperadoes come alive. They aver love and loyalty, defy death and solicit patience and money\u2014in pursuit of which they planned \u201cexpropriations\u201d, otherwise known as robberies. In 1909 some of their number perpetrated the \u201cTottenham Outrage\u201d, a payroll heist that left four people dead.", "On the night of December 16th 1910 the target was a jeweller\u2019s in Houndsditch, a commercial thoroughfare delineating the City from the East End, since remade in glass and steel. The gang rented premises behind the shop and set about breaking in. But they chose a Friday night, and the largely Jewish neighbourhood was quiet. Reports of suspicious noises attracted a policeman, then several, all unarmed. As well as the three fatalities, two officers were hurt when the criminals opened fire, in what was the worst-ever peacetime loss for British police. One robber, George Gardstein, alias Morountzeff, alias Milowitz, was hit in the melee. As he was dragged away, a passer-by took him for a drunk\u2014until his comrades brandished their guns.", "Follow the gang\u2019s getaway route, and for all the brash new towers you find that some things haven\u2019t changed. There is still a vertiginous drop in wealth as you head east from the City; the textile business still flourishes, albeit in South Asian rather than Jewish hands, the street markets offering kebabs instead of pickled herrings. Gardstein was left in squalid lodgings, where he was found, dead, the next day, along with weaponry and a membership card for an anarchist group named Leesma, meaning \u201cThe Flame\u201d.", "In British public opinion and newspapers, the crime reinforced the link between immigrants and revolutionaries, who, as some are now, were organised into slippery cells and cherished a transnational cause. Thousands lined the streets for the victims\u2019 funeral at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. The police posted a reward for the alleged kingpins in English, Russian and Yiddish\u2014among them Peter the Painter. In wanted posters bearing that name, a moustachioed man poses insouciantly for an elegant studio portrait.", "Blood and death", "This \u201cdashingly handsome\u201d figure, says Nadia Valman of Queen Mary University of London, would enter the city\u2019s mythology, straddling the border between felon and icon. According to the posters, Peter went by the surnames Piatkow and Schtern. He was \u201ca native of Russia, an anarchist\u201d. If the conspiracy was international, so was the chase. French police claimed Peter had lived in Marseilles. The Russians implicated him in a bomb plot in Crimea. A source placed him at an anarchist club in Paris, for which the password was \u201cBlood and death\u201d. He spoke several languages and played the violin. He corresponded with subversives in Baku; a sweetheart pined for him in Kyiv.", "That alliterative nickname contributed to his mystery. What did he paint\u2014houses or portraits? (The sets for amateur dramatics, some suggested.) Was he an artist or a working man, ordinary or exceptional\u2014or one disguised as the other? In a stroke of catchy branding, his moniker echoed that of the monster who had haunted London a generation earlier: Jack the Ripper.", "The East End had a penumbra of informers, double agents and provocateurs. On New Year\u2019s Day an acquaintance tipped off police that the fugitives were hiding at 100 Sidney Street. Two days later Peter the Painter\u2014the idea, if not the man\u2014collided with Churchill and his own, carefully cultivated image.", "He was in the bath when he got the call. Before dawn the police had evacuated the many other tenants of number 100; in the archives you can see a scrawled map they used to plan their ambush. But it was soon clear that their antiquated service weapons were no match for the brigands\u2019 pistols, and Churchill\u2019s authority was needed to summon a detachment of Scots Guards from the Tower of London.", "Today, to imagine the carnage that ensued, you have to substitute the crack of bullets for the noise of the construction site across Sidney Street\u2014occupied, in 1911, by a brewery, from the windows of which marksmen fired as others took aim from doorways, behind chimney pots or crouching in the slush. Inside the house the doomed men rushed between floors and windows to shoot back.", "Though only 36, Churchill was a veteran of combat, with (like Peter the Painter) an adventurous and embroidered past. He had ridden into battle at Omdurman and helped relieve the siege of Malakand. He had been captured on an armoured train and broken out of a Boer prison. He dressed, hurried to the Home Office and was quickly on the scene, impelled by both \u201cconvictions of duty\u201d and \u201ca strong sense of curiosity which perhaps it would have been well to keep in check\u201d.", "His cameo is preserved on jerky newsreel footage that played in cinemas almost immediately: the cameras made the siege \u201cthe first breaking news story in history\u201d, says Andrew Roberts, Churchill\u2019s most recent biographer. You can see the soldiers marching in, horses drawing up artillery, the puff of gun smoke and journalists huddling on the roof of the Rising Sun pub (since demolished, along with the Three Nuns, the anarchists\u2019 local). Police struggle to restrain the huge crowds that gathered\u2014rooftop seats were going for ten shillings. And there, sheltering around a corner, is a youthful Churchill, expostulating theatrically in a top hat and an astrakhan-collared coat.", "One story has it that Churchill\u2019s topper took a bullet\u2014unlikely, says Mr Roberts, since \u201cif it had, he\u2019d have kept it\u201d. His presence was controversial, first among the spectators, some of whom lambasted his liberal approach to immigration, later in Parliament. \u201cI understand what the photographer was doing,\u201d chided Arthur Balfour, leader of the Conservative Party, which Churchill left in 1904 and would later rejoin. \u201cBut what was the right-honourable gentleman doing?\u201d", "The answer, according to a newsreel caption, is that he was \u201cdirecting operations\u201d. He suggested seeking metal plates in preparation for storming the house. When, in the lurid finale, the building caught fire\u2014nobody knows how\u2014Churchill approved the decision to keep the fire brigade away. \u201cI thought it better to let the house burn down, than spend good British lives in rescuing these ferocious rascals,\u201d he told Herbert Asquith, the prime minister. Newsreels show gallant firemen rushing in after the roof collapsed. One, Charles Pearson, died after being hit by falling masonry. (The policeman shot at daybreak survived.)", "Two charred corpses, identified as William Sokoloff and Fritz Svaars, were found inside. One had been shot in the head; the other succumbed to the smoke. \u201cEverybody knows he must die some time,\u201d Svaars had written to relatives in Latvia on the eve of the siege. \u201cI know that if they catch me they will hang me.\u201d There was no trace of Peter the Painter.", "As shocking crimes can, the siege opened eyes. The police were given better weapons (Churchill oversaw the test firing). The chief constable of Sheffield sent down a bullet-proof shield, \u201cwhich may be of use when you find \u2018Peter the Painter\u2019.\u201d The investigation re-alerted the public to the overcrowded slumlands of the East End; Russia appealed for unity against the anarchist peril. Yet, as can also be true of such spectaculars, precisely what had happened was and remains unclear.", "In May 1911 four members of the gang were tried at the Old Bailey in connection with the Houndsditch murders: Peter the Painter was not among them. The judge sank the charges by asserting that the three chief culprits had already \u201cmet their doom\u201d. Blaming Gardstein, Svaars and Sokoloff was certainly convenient for their comrades in the dock, and, after the extravaganza of Sidney Street, for the government. In fact, the role and whereabouts of the last two during the fatal robbery are still disputed.", "Only Nina Vassileva, a Russian whose glamour and love-life inspired much comment, was convicted. Fingerprint evidence earned her a two-year sentence for conspiracy to rob\u2014but even that was soon quashed. The others walked, including Jacob Peters, a cousin of Svaars who had been collared before the siege. He became a much-feared official in the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, before meeting a sticky end in 1938. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman and author of a book about the case, reckons Peters and Gardstein did the shooting in Houndsditch.", "Angleshot Flavorum Enomotarch", "\u201cDon\u2019t be cross,\u201d Churchill implored a colleague after the siege, \u201cit was such fun.\u201d But his rush to Sidney Street was among the misjudgments held against him until he became prime minister\u2014whereupon, notes Mr Roberts, Churchill\u2019s \u201calmost obsessive need to be at the scene of the action\u201d became an asset. His direct observation of battles bolstered his grasp of the second world war (he would have joined the flotilla on D -Day had the king not intervened). His visits to districts shattered by the Blitz, during which he watched bombing raids from the roof of Downing Street, were \u201cextraordinarily good for morale\u201d. In retrospect the siege, says Mr Roberts, was \u201cvintage Churchill\u201d.", "Peter the Painter evaporated. Exchanges with their foreign counterparts indicate that, lacking \u201cconclusive proof\u201d to tie him to the crimes, British detectives quietly stopped looking for him. Police forces from Naples to Winnipeg thought they had him. He was said to be working as a chef in Melbourne, \u201cposing as a Frenchman\u201d yet \u201can excellent hand at throwing a knife or using a revolver\u201d. The coded reply to Australia is stored in the LMA . \u201cAngleshot Flavorum Enomotarch\u201d, the police telegrammed from London: \u201cnot to be arrested\u201d, as there was \u201cnot sufficient evidence\u201d for an extradition. It was too late: the fascination stirred by the wanted poster and sustained by rumour could not be stifled. Peter was widely held to have been in the burning house but somehow escaped. He was spotted in Denmark. He had moved to America. A police informer all along, his handlers had spirited him away. Soon the saga was transfigured by art. Alfred Hitchcock grew up near Sidney Street, and in his original version of \u201cThe Man Who Knew Too Much\u201d (1934), assassins hole up in a London house, spectators gather, a brave policeman knocks... In \u201cThe Siege of Sidney Street\u201d (1960) Peter is a suave fanatic trailed by an undercover Donald Sinden. Trapped in the siege, Peter sets the fire, breaks through the walls and melts into the crowd. \u201cI wonder who it was that got away,\u201d Sinden\u2019s character muses when the bodies don\u2019t tally. In a TV drama of 2012 Peter leads an uprising of third-class passengers on the Titanic. In Emanuel Litvinoff\u2019s novel \u201cA Death out of Season\u201d (1973), he is sent by the tsarist secret police to plot the king\u2019s assassination, and so curtail Britain\u2019s tolerance of political refugees. But his heart is with the renegades. Amid the hearsay and embellishments, records the \u201cDictionary of National Biography\u201d, doubts arose \u201cas to whether he existed at all\u201d. Nothing about his life \u201cis altogether reliable\u201d. In his book \u201cA Towering Flame\u201d, Philip Ruff insists Peter was real. Citing tsarist files and unpublished memoirs, Mr Ruff says he is \u201c100% certain\u201d that the man in the poster was Janis Zhaklis. A social-democrat-turned-anarchist, Zhaklis had led a raid on a prison in Riga, robbed a bank in Helsinki and started a radical journal in America. Only peripherally involved in London, he fled to Brussels before, thinks Mr Ruff, becoming a businessman in Australia.", "Maybe. But at this distance, identifying the \u201creal\u201d Peter the Painter is akin to finding the real Robin Hood, or perhaps King Arthur, both of whom his quicksilver image resembles\u2014an indomitable will-o\u2019-the-wisp who lives to fight another day. The fable spread: Irish insurgents called the type of pistol used by the anarchists a Peter the Painter. The flesh-and-blood man was subsumed by legend.", "All this happened \u201cmany moons ago\u201d, says a resident of the flats in Sidney Street. But it is not entirely forgotten. Another plaque commemorates the fireman who perished. Walk away from the corner where Churchill huddled, passing women in headscarves who are heirs to the Edwardian immigrants, and you find two more blocks of flats: Siege House\u2014and Painter House. Justifying that name, the local housing body said there was no evidence Peter had killed anyone. \u201cThere is some doubt as to whether he existed,\u201d it stated, \u201cbut his is the name that East Enders associate with the siege.\u201d The man who wasn\u2019t there now always will be. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["1911", "street", "east", "end", "today", "man", "house", "sidney", "peter", "standoff", "painter", "churchill", "london", "siege", "londons", "echoes"], "pubDate": "2020-12-19T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
