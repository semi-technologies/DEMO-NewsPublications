We\u2019ve been selling way more of our Learn to Knit kits than ever before,\u201d says Joelle Hoverson, co-owner of New York knitting store Purl Soho, which has been operating online-only since March. One of the last customers to come into the physical store was Kate Hudson, while regulars include Uma Thurman and Katie Holmes. \u201cWe\u2019re getting many, many more comments on our website than usual \u2013 and for the most part they are the questions of a person who\u2019s right in the middle of trying to learn a new technique.\u201d", "The New York store stocks a kaleidoscopic range of colours \u201cA thicker yarn that\u2019s very easy to knit with\u201d: Super Soft Merino, $22 \u00a9 Purl Soho (2)", "Hoverson\u2019s take on knitting is no flash-in-the-pan fad, however. She set up shop 18 years ago in a tiny space in SoHo\u2019s Sullivan Street, after cutting her craft teeth at US homemaking stalwart Martha Stewart Living magazine. \u201cI was really into knitting but I couldn\u2019t find the shop that I wanted to shop in \u2013 a store that sold all the most beautiful yarns.\u201d Her kaleidoscopic selection of \u201cpure, natural fibres\u201d has since shuttled into bigger premises nearby and been joined by her own-brand ranges, alongside all the tools and books imaginable.", "The website has flourished in tandem, with Hoverson\u2019s sister Jennifer overseeing a fulfilment centre in California, and her friend and former colleague Page Marchese Norman joining in 2008. \u201cOver time, we realised that the online content was really driving and defining the business,\u201d says Hoverson of the wealth of patterns she and a team of contributors have conceived over the years \u2013 from the simple chunky ribbed Seafaring scarf to the Striped Crew socks and the cool neon-pop Windy Day blanket.", "Purl\u2019s Windy Day blanket pattern is free; a kit with Linen Quill Worsted yarn is $280 The store also sells knitting kit such as Slip-N-Snip folding scissors, $24 \u00a9 Purl Soho (2)", "\u201cMy favourite things to knit are blankets because they\u2019re these big colour stories, and you don\u2019t have to worry if they fit or not,\u201d says Hoverson. \u201cThere are two projects I designed that I particularly love: one called Nature\u2019s Palette and a newer one called the Library blanket.\u201d Both are available as all-inclusive kits \u2013 catering to a customer base that is primarily \u201cadvanced beginners\u201d \u2013 as is the investment-level Cashmere Ombr\u00e9 wrap, containing eight skeins of fine, hand-dyed Mongolian cashmere and priced at $410.", "\u201cYarn is still the cornerstone of what we do,\u201d adds Hoverson. \u201cWe sell lots of our own Linen Quill \u2013 a fairly fine blend of alpaca, linen and wool that comes in a humongous array of colours \u2013 and our Super Soft Merino, which is a thicker yarn that\u2019s very easy to knit with.\u201d But it\u2019s not all knitting. When Purl Soho posted a free sewing pattern online for City Gym shorts in 2014, mixing floral Liberty prints with a sportswear aesthetic, \u201cit kind of went viral.
