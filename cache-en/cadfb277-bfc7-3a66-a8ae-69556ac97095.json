Both were evident in an eleventh-hour deal struck on December 10th in Brussels between the European Union\u2019s 27 heads of government. With a fiscal crunch looming, the leaders at last gave the green light to a seven-year EU budget worth \u20ac1.1trn ($1.3trn) as well as a one-off \u20ac750bn fund, financed by joint borrowing, to speed recovery from the covid-19 crisis.", "The sticking-point was a problem that has long bedevilled the EU : how to tackle corruption and other skulduggery in countries that benefit from EU transfers. At a gruelling four-day summit in July, the leaders backed the principle of attaching rule-of-law conditions to the vast EU spending they had approved. But Hungary and Poland, unhappy with the proposed legal regulations that followed in November, threatened to veto both the budget and the recovery fund. (Both countries are already facing EU rule-of-law probes over their government\u2019s interference with national judiciaries and other matters.)", "Faced with drastic cuts that would have applied had the EU begun 2021 without a budget in place, the European Commission considered the radical step of rebuilding the recovery fund outside EU structures, excluding the hold-outs. That threat, say diplomats, concentrated minds in Warsaw and Budapest. In a late flurry of diplomacy the German government, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, issued a supplementary proposal. Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, flew to Poland to persuade his allies to sign on. Satisfied with Mrs Merkel\u2019s work, the rest of the EU assented in Brussels.", "Under the German proposal, the text of the rule-of-law regulation remains untouched. That enables the European Commission to block disbursements of EU money, including from the recovery fund, if it suspects recipient governments of corruption or other foul play, so long as a qualified majority of EU governments agree. That could pose a threat to the system of authoritarian cronyism Mr Orban has assembled on the back of EU funds amounting to around 3% of annual GDP . Poland\u2019s system is cleaner but, notes Piotr Buras at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Warsaw, the government\u2019s court-stacking could fall foul of the regulation\u2019s references to judicial independence, if the commission thinks it interferes with the management of EU funds.", "The biggest concession to the hold-outs was an agreement that no action would be taken under the mechanism until the EU \u2019s top court had ruled on its legality, a process that could take up to two years (but which is likely to be accelerated). Critics, such as George Soros, a financier and Mr Orban\u2019s b\u00eate noire, see this and smaller concessions as a sell-out to the rogues. Indeed, after the summit Mr Orban declared victory with typical bombast. But both his and Poland\u2019s government had vowed to see off the regulation. Their failure even to water it down shows where the burden of compromise really fell. Poland\u2019s hardline justice minister, who said the deal violated the constitution, even threatened to bring down his government, before backing down."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["fund", "european", "recovery", "governments", "weapon", "loaded", "violations", "mr", "gives", "long", "orban", "polands", "ruleoflaw", "battle", "locked", "eu"], "pubDate": "2020-12-19T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
