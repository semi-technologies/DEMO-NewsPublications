Jeenah Moon for The New York Times The United States on Wednesday recorded over 100,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day for the first time since the pandemic began, bursting past a grim threshold even as the wave of infections engulfing the country shows no sign of receding. The total count of new infections on Wednesday was more than 107,800, according to a New York Times database. Twenty-three states have recorded more cases in the past week than in any other seven-day stretch. Five states \u2014 Maine, Minnesota, Indiana, Nebraska and Colorado \u2014 set single-day case records. Cases were also mounting in the Mountain West and even in the Northeast, which over the summer seemed to be getting the virus under control. North and South Dakota and Wisconsin have led the country for weeks in the number of new cases relative to their population. But other states have seen steep recent increases in the last 14 days. Daily case reports in Minnesota, on average, have increased 102 percent over that time, while those in Indiana have risen 73 percent. For months, Maine had among the lowest levels of transmission anywhere in the country, but new cases there have more than tripled. In Wyoming, new cases are up 73 percent, while in Iowa they have more than doubled. Deaths related to the coronavirus, which lag behind case reports, have increased 21 percent across the country in the last two weeks. Hospitals in some areas are feeling the strain of surging caseloads. More than 50,000 people are currently hospitalized with Covid-19 across the country, according to the Covid Tracking Project, an increase of roughly 64 percent since the beginning of October. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, predicted in June, when new cases were averaging roughly 42,000 a day, that the rate would eventually reach 100,000 a day if the pandemic were not brought under control. His blunt assessments of the country\u2019s failure to control the virus drew attacks from Trump administration officials, including the president, who called him alarmist. In an interview on Friday, Dr. Fauci told The Washington Post that the country would most likely hit the 100,000 mark soon. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a whole lot of hurt,\u201d he said. Dr. Fauci said that the country \u201ccould not possibly be positioned more poorly\u201d as winter approaches and colder temperatures lead people to gather indoors. States report new cases unevenly from day to day, so seven-day averages are a more reliable gauge of trends than an individual day\u2019s figures are. But Wednesday was bad by that measure as well, with the seven-day average exceeding 90,000, the highest since the pandemic began. During the early days of the pandemic in March and April, testing in the United States was very limited, so it is not possible to say with certainty that the virus is spreading faster now than it did then. But the pattern of infection has clearly changed. Dr. Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said this week that while the surges in the spring and summer were concentrated in specific regions \u2014 the Northeast in the spring and the Sun Belt in the summer \u2014 the current one reflects transmission increases in nearly all parts of the country. Dr. Hanage called Wednesday\u2019s milestone \u201cthe completely foreseeable consequence of not taking pandemic management seriously.\u201d And he said the country would see \u201chospitalizations and deaths increase in due course.\u201d \u201cThis is desperately concerning,\u201d Dr. Hanage said, \u201cbecause uncontrolled transmission will end up compromising health care, and in order to preserve it, we will almost certainly end up needing to take stronger action to prevent the worst outcomes.\u201d \u201cLook to Europe to see the consequences of leaving it too late,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer you leave it, the harder it will be to control.\u201d \u2014", "Italy will lock down six regions and prevent many people from crossing between them. Lombardy is one of the regions in Italy that will be going into lockdown. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times The Italian government announced Wednesday night that it would lock down a significant portion of the country, including the northern regions that are its economic engine, in an effort to stop a resurgent wave of coronavirus infections. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the measures, the most drastic since the nationwide lockdown in March, would take effect on Friday and will seal off six regions in the country\u2019s deeply infected north and highly vulnerable, and poorer, south. \u201cThe situation is particularly critical,\u201d Mr. Conte said at an evening news conference. He said the virus was moving at a \u201cstrong and even violent\u201d pace. Across Europe, efforts to halt a second wave of cases with piecemeal measures are being replaced by far stricter rules \u2014 and hurried efforts to bolster health systems that could quickly reach capacity in the coming weeks. Starting Thursday, England will be under a second lockdown. Poland will shut schools and shops this weekend, and Lithuania will enter a full lockdown. Switzerland has called in the army to bolster hospitals. And France\u2019s health minister is pushing to extend a state of emergency until February. In Italy, the new measures will ban residents of the six regions from crossing borders except for work, health or other \u201csituations of necessity,\u201d Mr. Conte said. Movement within the regions will also be strictly limited. Bars and restaurants will be closed in all of the regions and shops selling nonessential goods will be closed in most of them. Three of the regions span the country\u2019s northwest and include Lombardy, which is the home of Italy\u2019s financial capital Milan, Piedmont and Aosta Valley. The southern regions are Calabria, Puglia and the island of Sicily. Mr. Conte said the restrictions, which have triggered fierce opposition from business groups, restaurants and many citizens exasperated with government limits on their freedom, were being put in place because \u201cthere is a high probability that some regions will exceed the critical limits in intensive care units\u201d in the coming weeks. \u201cWe necessarily have to intervene,\u201d he said. The country will be essentially divided into three zones: red, orange and yellow, each with its own restrictions. The government will make those assessments on a weekly basis. The announcement adds specifics to a new government decree, announced earlier on Wednesday, which imposed a 10 p.m. curfew around the country and closed museums, high schools and, on the weekend, shopping malls. Mr. Conte also \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d that Italians stay home during the day, but deferred the decision to establish local lockdowns to the country\u2019s health minister and the regional governors. Mr. Conte said he had chosen a more targeted approach rather than a blanket lockdown because nationwide measures might be ineffective for the most infected areas and too draconian for places with fewer cases. In Britain, Mr. Johnson spoke before Parliament on Wednesday, saying there was no alternative to a monthlong lockdown if a \u201cmedical and moral disaster\u201d was to be avoided. For weeks, Mr. Johnson had resisted such drastic measures, rejecting calls from scientists who advise the government, and from the opposition Labour Party, for an earlier but shorter lockdown. Britain has been the worst-hit country by the pandemic in Europe, with more than 60,000 deaths. London was bustling with shoppers hours before the new rules took effect. Stores, restaurants, pubs and other nonessential businesses must close for a month; schools will remain open. People will be asked to stay home unless they are needed at work, or out to buy food or exercise. Germany and France, which tried piecemeal measures, have reimposed nationwide lockdowns. Discontent has mounted throughout Italy in recent weeks, with restaurant and bar owners taking to the streets to protest early closings recently imposed by the authorities. Yet Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has vowed to carry on with the new restrictive measures. At the Vatican, Pope Francis on Wednesday returned to his private library for his weekly general audience, as he urged people to follow the recommendations of political and health authorities. The pope stopped public audiences in March, but resumed them at the beginning of September, allowing small groups to participate in a Vatican courtyard or the audience hall. Switzerland called on the army to support its medical services on Wednesday as the daily number of virus cases hit a new peak. The Swiss cabinet said it agreed to deploy up to 2,500 military personnel to support testing, care and transport services. Switzerland recorded more than 10,000 cases on Wednesday, a single-day record, and 73 deaths. Lithuania said it would impose a nationwide lockdown as of Friday, after the number of new cases tripled in recent weeks, while the prime minister of Denmark, and most of the government, went into quarantine after the justice minister tested positive for the virus. Poland stopped short of a national lockdown, but announced new restrictions on Wednesday. Cultural institutions and nonessential shops in commercial centers must close on Saturday, and the number of customers allowed into other shops will be limited. Hotels will only be allowed to accept business travelers, and all schools starting at first grade will switch to online learning. \u2014 Karen Zraick, Stephen Castle, Elian Peltier, Elisabetta Povoledo, Emma Bubola, Nick Cumming-Bruce and", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "Voters who saw containing the virus as the most important issue favored Biden. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, spoke to supporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times As the United States faces a dual national crisis \u2014 a monthslong pandemic and economic devastation \u2014 voters were deeply divided on what mattered more: containing the coronavirus or hustling to rebuild the economy, according to early exit polls and voter surveys released Tuesday. Their opinion of which was more important fell along starkly partisan lines, with those who viewed the pandemic as the most pressing issue favoring Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president, while those who named the economy and jobs broke overwhelmingly toward re-electing President Trump. Reflecting a pervasive pessimism, nearly two-thirds of voters said they believed the country was heading in the wrong direction, according to an Associated Press canvass of those who had cast ballots \u2014 and those voters overwhelmingly picked Mr. Biden. And while Mr. Trump had attempted to focus the campaign on anything other than the pandemic, it remained a defining issue: More than four in 10 voters said it was the most important problem facing the country, far more than any other issue. A separate survey \u2014 the traditional exit poll, conducted by Edison Research \u2014 asked the question differently; it found that, as important as it was to them, only about one in five voters considered the virus the top issue affecting their vote. More said the economy was, and a similar share said racial inequality decided their ballots. The overwhelming majority of Trump supporters called the economy excellent or good while an equal share of Biden supporters said it was doing poorly. Views of the virus also cleaved to politics: Roughly four in five Trump supporters called it at least somewhat under control, while as many Biden voters said it was \u201cnot at all under control.\u201d Those who reported that the pandemic had taken a personal toll tended to back Mr. Biden. More than a third of all voters said they or someone in their household had lost a job or income over the past eight months, and most of those voters favored Mr. Biden. \u2014 Jennifer Medina and", "North Dakota candidate, who died of Covid-19 last month, wins seat in state legislature. A North Dakota man who died from the coronavirus last month won a seat in the state legislature, according to results. David Andahl, a 55-year-old cattle rancher, died last month, after being hospitalized with the coronavirus, the Bismarck Tribune reported. Mr. Andahl\u2019s mother, Pat Andahl, told the newspaper that her son, a Republican who in June defeated a longtime incumbent in the primary vote, had been looking forward to joining the state legislature. \u201cHe had a lot of feelings for his county and his country and wanting to make things better, and his heart was in farming,\u201d Ms. Andahl told the Tribune. \u201cHe wanted things better for farmers and the coal industry.\u201d Mr. Andahl, who won 36 percent of the vote, and Dave Nehring, who won 41 percent of votes, were elected to represent North Dakota\u2019s eighth state house district. Because mail-in voting began in the state on Sept. 18, Mr. Andahl\u2019s name could not be removed from the ballot after his death, North Dakota\u2019s secretary of state, Alvin Jaeger, said. Mr. Jaeger, who has held his position since 1993, said he did not recall any other time that a candidate in North Dakota had died while balloting was underway. On Wednesday, Gov. Doug Burgum said that he had appointed Wade Boeshans, the president and general manager of BNI Energy, to fill the seat won by Mr. Andahl. The move came as a surprise to some officials. In mid-October, North Dakota\u2019s attorney general, Wayne Stenehjem, said that Mr. Andahl\u2019s seat, if he were elected, should be filled the same way as a vacancy following the retirement or death of lawmaker. In those cases, the district committee of the political party of the deceased person holds a meeting within 21 days of the vacancy and appoints someone to fill it. But Mr. Burgum, a Republican, said that he believed only he had the power to fill the empty seat. \u201cAfter extensive research, it became clear that the only legal and constitutionally viable way to fill the District 8 seat is through gubernatorial appointment,\u201d he said in a statement. Soon after, Mr. Stenehjem, also a Republican, released a statement saying the governor\u2019s appointment was improper. \u2014", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "With their restaurants forced to close early, Italians are crossing into tiny San Marino for dinner. Coronavirus restrictions introduced in Italy last month required eateries to close at 6 p.m. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times With Italy\u2019s restaurants forced to close early in response to a steep rise in new virus cases, San Marino, an independent microstate within northern Italy, has emerged as a dining destination. Coronavirus restrictions introduced in Italy last month require eateries to close at 6 p.m. \u2014 hours earlier than most Italians eat dinner. Restaurants in San Marino stay open until midnight and, in some areas, are just a 10-minute drive across the border. But the tiny state\u2019s emergence as a late-night restaurant quarter has raised fears that travelers could spread the virus. And as virus cases spike in Italy, new rules may lead to more open tables. Starting Thursday, Italians will be subject to a 10 p.m. nationwide curfew, which will make it harder for people to go out for dinner at all. Pressure has also been building on San Marino to change its policies. A group of 15 mayors from bordering Italian towns wrote an open letter to San Marino, arguing that the country\u2019s authorities should match Italy\u2019s restrictions. The Vatican, for example, has followed Italy\u2019s lead and adopted similar restrictions throughout the pandemic. San Marino has recorded roughly 1,000 coronavirus cases among its 30,000 inhabitants since the pandemic began \u2014 one of the highest per capita figures in the world, according to a Times database. But the authorities there have argued that with only three new reported cases on Monday, the situation is under control. They have also said that the strict social-distancing protocols in bars and restaurants are sufficient to keep the risk low. Italy\u2019s early closing hours have caused widespread frustration, with restaurant and bar owners taking to the streets in recent days in several cities. \u2014", "A mutation in the virus has prompted Denmark to kill millions of infected mink. Denmark has already begun killing all mink at 400 farms that were either infected, or close enough to infected farms, to cause concern. Credit... Henning Bagger/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The Danish government will slaughter millions of mink at more than 1,000 farms, citing concerns that a mutation in the novel coronavirus that has infected them could possibly interfere with the effectiveness of a vaccine. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen made the announcement at a news conference on Wednesday. There are 15 million or more mink in Denmark, which is one of the world\u2019s major exporters of mink furs. She said the armed forces would be involved in the culling of the animals. At the news conference, according to Danish news reports, Kare Molbak, the head of the Danish Serum Institute, warned that some coronavirus mutations could impede the efficacy of future vaccines for humans. The government has notified the World Health Organization about the mutation, which shows a weak reaction to antibodies. Twelve people in Jutland are known to have virus with the mutation too, the W.H.O. said. Without published reports on the nature of the mutation or how the virus variant was tested, research scientists outside Denmark who study the virus were left somewhat in the dark. Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa and a specialist on the novel coronavirus, said he could not evaluate the Danish statements without more information. In September, Dutch scientists reported in a paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed that the virus was jumping between mink and humans. In Denmark, the government described a version of the virus that migrated from mink to humans. The coronavirus mutates slowly but regularly, and a different variant of the virus would not, in itself, be cause for concern, experts have said. Researchers have previously studied one mutation labeled D614G in the spike protein of the virus that may increase transmission. They concluded that there is no evidence so far that this particular mutation increases virulence or would affect the workings of a vaccine. Denmark has already begun killing all mink at 400 farms that were either infected, or close enough to infected farms, to cause concern. The killing of all mink will wipe out the industry, perhaps for years. Mink are in the weasel family, along with ferrets, which are easily infected with the coronavirus. But while ferrets appear to suffer mild symptoms, mink react more like humans. Many conservation scientists have become concerned about the spread of the virus to animal populations, like chimpanzees, which are believed to be susceptible, although cases have not been identified yet. \u2014", "China imposes even more stringent rules on those trying to enter the country. At Beijing Daxing International Airport in September. China is tightening restrictions on arriving travelers. Credit... Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters China is already one of the hardest countries in the world to enter during the pandemic. But on Saturday, it will become even harder. New Chinese government rules taking effect will require travelers to obtain not just a nucleic acid test for the coronavirus but also a blood test for antibodies against the virus. Both tests must be performed less than 48 hours before a passenger boards a flight to China. If the traveler obtains negative results on both tests, the traveler will then also need to have the results approved by a Chinese embassy or consulate and obtain an email of a stamped Chinese government form before making the trip. If the traveler has a transit stop in another country on the way to China, the same tests and consulate or embassy approval will also be required in the transit country. The new rules apply to both Chinese nationals and foreign residents. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China criticized the latest rules. \u201cWhile technically leaving the door open, these changes imply a de facto ban on anyone trying to get back to their lives, work and families in China,\u201d the chamber said in a statement. The chamber also criticized the new requirement for an antibody test, noting that in some countries these tests are only available to essential personnel and frontline medical workers. \u201cIt also remains unclear why a positive antibody test result would disqualify returnees, as many of those with antibodies had the virus months ago and present no significantly greater risk than those without antibodies,\u201d the statement said. \u2014", "Advertisement Continue reading the main story", "Global roundup Kenya extends a curfew and bans political gatherings as cases rise.

Tony Karumba/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Kenya\u2019s president introduced a raft of new measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus on Wednesday, after admitting that the rising number of cases was a reversal of the gains achieved in the early months of the pandemic. The East African nation eased containment measures in late September, reopening schools, churches and bars with strict protocols in place. But the laxity in applying the rules, especially in the transport, entertainment and hospitality industries, as well as at political meetings and rallies, led to a sharp rise in virus cases. In October alone, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the country recorded more than 15,000 new cases of Covid-19 and approximately 300 deaths. Kenya has so far recorded at least 57,000 cases of the virus and more than 1,000 deaths, according to a Times database. \u201cOctober has gone down as the most tragic month in our fight against Covid,\u201d he said in a televised speech on Wednesday. Mr. Kenyatta announced the suspension of political gatherings for two months and ordered that all bars and restaurants be closed by 9 p.m. He also extended the nationwide curfew to Jan. 3 and moved back the start of the curfew each night to 10 p.m. All government employees over the age of 58 and those who are immunocompromised will be asked to work remotely, Mr. Kenyatta said. All in-person learning will resume in January 2021, even though dozens of students and teachers tested positive after schools were partially reopened last month. Earlier in the day, Wycliffe Oparanya, the chairman of the Council of Governors, said that as many as 12 of the country\u2019s 47 counties had not attained the minimum 300-bed capacity stipulated to accommodate virus patients. He also said 11 counties had fewer than five intensive care unit beds in their isolation facilities, and warned of an increasing number of doctors getting infected by the virus. Mr. Kenyatta said Kenya was \u201cnow staring at a new wave of this pandemic\u201d and urged citizens to observe the new rules. \u201cThe most fragile point in any war happens at the point when victory is in sight,\u201d Mr. Kenyatta said. \u201cThis is why I emphasized that to win the overall war, the citizens have to exercise their civic duty and responsibility, especially in observing the Covid protocols.\u201d In other developments around the world: Algeria\u2019s secretive presidency confirmed that the mysterious illness that led to the hospitalization of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in Germany last week was the coronavirus, The Associated Press reported.
