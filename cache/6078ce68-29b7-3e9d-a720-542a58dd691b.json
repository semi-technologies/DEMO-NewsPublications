{"paragraphs": ["Kitty Hawk, Larry Page\u2019s air taxi outfit, on Thursday showed off its latest concept\u2014an eight-motor prototype that uses an unconventional forward-swept wing, and is purportedly 100 times quieter than a conventional helicopter. The Mountain View, California-based company calls it Heaviside, after noted physicist and electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside, who advanced a variety of theories and innovations in mathematics, electronics, and communications in the early 20th century.", "Want the latest news on flying cars in your inbox?

Based on the altitude and flight characteristics demonstrated in a short video, Kitty Hawk appears to be relatively far along with the aircraft, compared with other electric vertical-lift aircraft (aka flying car) efforts, many of which have showed concepts and prototypes but haven\u2019t flown much. A company spokesperson says all of Heaviside\u2019s flights so far have been remotely controlled.", "This is the third aircraft Kitty Hawk has shown publicly. The single-seat Flyer, which can hover between 3 and 10 feet above the ground, is meant for recreational use. The larger Cora, which Kitty Hawk is testing in New Zealand, uses 10 rotors and is targeted toward the kind of air taxi market championed by Uber. Kitty Hawk has said little about its goals for Heaviside, but it appears closer to a final candidate for urban mobility, with a refined shape and what appears to be a more developed noise-control strategy.", "Kitty Hawk is funded by Page and led by Sebastian Thrun, who at Google launched Google X and the self-driving effort that\u2019s now Waymo. Thrun has placed considerable emphasis on that acoustic signature, which promises to be one of the greatest challenges in terms of public acceptance of urban air mobility.", "LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones", "The new video shows the aircraft flying at 1,500 feet and producing a barely audible 38 decibels, while a conventional helicopter at the same altitude produces 60 decibels. The ultimate vision, Thrun told WIRED earlier this year, is to \u201cfree the world from traffic.\u201d But that hinges as much on social acceptance of these aircraft\u2014including the noise they make\u2014as on technical developments. \u201cThis is a decade-long question,\u201d Thrun said."], "pubDate": null, "summary": "Kitty Hawk, Larry Page\u2019s air taxi outfit, on Thursday showed off its latest concept\u2014an eight-motor prototype that uses an unconventional forward-swept wing, and is purportedly 100 times quieter than a conventional helicopter.\nBased on the altitude and flight characteristics demonstrated in a short video, Kitty Hawk appears to be relatively far along with the aircraft, compared with other electric vertical-lift aircraft (aka flying car) efforts, many of which have showed concepts and prototypes but haven\u2019t flown much.\nThis is the third aircraft Kitty Hawk has shown publicly.\nThe larger Cora, which Kitty Hawk is testing in New Zealand, uses 10 rotors and is targeted toward the kind of air taxi market championed by Uber.\nKitty Hawk is funded by Page and led by Sebastian Thrun, who at Google launched Google X and the self-driving effort that\u2019s now Waymo.", "title": "Kitty Hawk\u2019s New Flying Car Promises a (Near) Silent Flight", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/kitty-hawk-heaviside-larry-page-flying-car/", "keywords": ["video", "promises", "silent", "flying", "heaviside", "air", "hawk", "near", "hawks", "wired", "car", "flight", "thrun", "aircraft", "appears", "kitty"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Eric Adam", "Brian Barrett", "Lily Hay Newman", "Kiona N.
