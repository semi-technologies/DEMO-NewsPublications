He would fill these bottles with gin and give them to his friends at parties. They were worth the equivalent of a canalside house \u2013 Van Hoorn really was the Kim Kardashian of his time.", "\u201cEighty years ago, pieces like this were being sold as examples of Holland\u2019s glorious history, but Van Hoorn had a lot of blood on his hands in Indonesia and Africa. His story is extremely relevant to the current debate about slavery, which is why I tell it. If I was Indonesian, I\u2019d buy one of these bottles just to thumb my nose at the colonial past.\u201d", "At the end of last month, Zebregs opened Zebregs&R\u00f6ell Fine Art & Antiques on the corner of Spiegelstraat and Keizersgracht. He wants to breathe new life into an industry with a somewhat fusty image.", "Brand label", "\u201cThe average antiques dealer is sixty plus,\u201d he says. \u201cUp until the 1980s, almost every living room had a display cabinet, but they\u2019ve gone out of fashion. That\u2019s why you see so many collections of ornamental elephants on sale on Marktplaats.", "\u201cPeople in their thirties and forties don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to live with antiques and collect things. Their furniture is functional, and comes with a brand label. They don\u2019t even see antiques at grandpa and grandma\u2019s house, because they have bare white interiors too. Nothing gets passed on from generation to generation. I want to change that, and make collecting attractive to a younger audience.\u201d", "Zebregs fell in love with antiques when he worked as a temp at the AAG auction house in the Rivierenbuurt, while doing applied museum and heritage studies at the Reinwardt Academy. He ended up spending ten years with the company, and became head of the antiques department.", "\u201cI was always nosing around in boxes of pots and pans. I used to buy the occasional Chinese food bowl or Indonesian painting, but my greatest passion is taxidermy. My grandfather had a stuffed squirrel monkey, and when I moved into student housing I took it with me. I started dealing in stuffed animals, and my apartment on Rozengracht filled up so quickly my friends called it the Jungle.\u201d", "Letter to Attenborough", "The friends also jokingly called him David Attenborough. \u201cI wrote a letter to the real Attenborough once, because I felt a bit funny about selling stuffed animals. I asked if he thought it was OK, especially as they were antiques. I got a handwritten letter back in three days, saying that stuffed animals could be educational, because people could look at them from close up, and they showed the importance of conservation. People might even eat a bit less meat.\u201d", "Zebregs gives a great deal of thought to the ethical aspects of his work. \u201cI\u2019m earning a living from the colonial past, but it\u2019s still with us and it\u2019s not going to go away. At least I can make sure it gets restored and written about, and continues on its journey.\u201d", "He never planned to open a shop, but when he met the leading Maastricht dealer Guus R\u00f6ell at the Tefaf art fair last year, they clicked immediately. The premises on Spiegelstraat came onto the market, and it was now or never. R\u00f6ell\u2019s name appears on the canopy outside as a partner, but the feel of the interior is 100 percent Zebregs.", "He describes his eclectic wares, ranging from African woodcarvings and a stuffed peacock to Japanese netsuke and a walnut dresser, as a cabinet of rarities. \u201cPeriod rooms have had their day. I show that you can combine a French chest with a modern abstract painting and a pair of candlesticks. And yes, why not an Ikea bench. But why spend two thousand euro on a readymade package when, for the same money, you can have an antique table with a story of its own? And it lasts so much longer. Once you\u2019ve dismantled a piece of Ikea furniture twice, it\u2019s fit for the scrapheap. Whereas if you resell the antique table, you give it a new lease on life.\u201d", "Bread or shoes", "Using a combination of enthusiastic storytelling, drinks receptions, and an Instagram account, Zebregs is attracting a younger clientele than his fellow antique dealers. \u201cThey\u2019re often very exclusive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are some shops where I don\u2019t even dare go inside.\u201d But his choice of the Spiegelkwartier was deliberate.", "\u201cAmsterdam used to be the antiques centre of Europe, and this area is its beating heart. The appeal is still there, but the market is getting older and sometimes one antiques shop closes without another being opened. If there\u2019s a gap, it\u2019s filled by a baker\u2019s or a shoe shop. That\u2019s a shame. We need to attract more young people to antiques dealing if we\u2019re to preserve the face of Amsterdam.\u201d"], "authors": ["Edo Dijksterhuis", "Translation", "Het Vertaalcollectief"], "keywords": ["dont", "van", "hoorn", "netherlands", "zebregs", "house", "friends", "ikea", "youngest", "swap", "dealer", "stuffed", "shop", "antiques"], "pubDate": "2019-11-19T10:15:00Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
