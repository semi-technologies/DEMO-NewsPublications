This isn\u2019t Heston-esque chemistry, but the hows and whys divided into seven fundamentals: brightness; bitterness; saltiness; sweetness; savoriness; fieriness and richness \u2013 with dishes to showcase each. The recipes themselves are a delightful mashup of Indian and American flavours: \u201cI use food as a way to connect my past with my present and future \u2013 to weave a thread between my life in India, my life in America, and the people and places I\u2019ve seen and met along the way,\u201d says Sharma. Favourites include a masala cheddar cornbread and a garlic and ginger dal with greens.

They are all here: fish pies, pork pies, chicken pies, cheese and onion pies, beef pies, cottage pies, game pies \u2026 though the book starts with most every kind of pastry (too exhaustive and long to begin to list) with puddings ranging from tarts, cobbler and clafoutis. It comes into its own with the chapter devoted to \u201cgrand party pieces\u201d. Here are the two-day, eight-page pie masterpieces such as the ultimate beef wellington and coronation chicken pie, well presented, painstakingly and patiently told. An engaging trip into the mind and kitchen of a cook who found his voice. AJ", "Buy it for its authority and clarity.

The spices have become spicier, from further afield, the shift a little further from core old-school Ottolenghi, but there is nothing here to frighten the faithful. The recipes read beautifully, the flavour profiles are carefully constructed, the warm voice in the writing reassuring. The wider world it inhabits is made comforting and accessible. In short, another Ottolenghi triumph.

Gill loves sugary things: \u201cI try to eat something sweet every single day,\u201d she says. This book is full of this enthusiasm \u2013 and an obsession with perfection. The perfect chocolate chip cookies were, rightly, a runaway hit during the banana-bread madness of lockdown and her sassy Instagram videos serve as a fitting accompaniment to the title. What makes the book special is that Gill makes patisserie feel easy. From caramel and creme pat to marshmallow, meringue and puff pastry, there\u2019s no better guide.

Often, here, Magnus Nilsson is both. Something of a hybrid, too, the book is a collection of musings, memoir and a completist list of every dish cooked at his decade-defining cult restaurant Faviken, with many Phaidon-era photos. The first piece of writing is already post-Faviken, titled \u201cHow to care for an apple tree\u201d (Nilsson now works an orchard in the south of Sweden far from his frozen north). Perhaps the most compelling piece chronicles the breakdown that preceded the decision to close the restaurant after 11 years. Sometimes the book\u2019s separate identities sit less easily together and you might wish it was one or the other, although Nilsson excels at both. You leave the book feeling he will likely also make an excellent gardener. AJ", "Buy it for dipping in and out.

There is a playfulness in these pages, an openness backed by rigour, an authentic celebration of diversity, heritage and flavour. It is there to be found in the voice and recipes: an inviting blending of cross-culture favourites, such as oyster pani puri, spicy scrag end pie, or paneer gnudi with saag.

Their father doesn\u2019t speak French. Meanwhile Buford cannot get a top chef to take him on so he apprentices to kindly Bob the baker and learns to make bread. He also learns to kill a pig up close. Finally, he studies at L\u2019Institut Paul Bocuse and achieves his dream to work at Brasier where he and a younger female stagiere are bullied.

The mindful mindlessness of peeling a potato, plus stacks of recipes. It is apparent on the contents page: the first chapter titled What is a Recipe?. And others: A Loving Defence of Brown Food, and Much Depends on Dinner. The recipes are reassuring, almost timeless. No need now to be too modern. Deliciousness is all. It is subtitled Ingredients, Recipes and Stories \u2013 and for me, it is the story writing that transcends.
