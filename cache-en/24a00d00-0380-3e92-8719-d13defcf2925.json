He was again added to the cast in Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition. Even Ninja Theory\u2019s DmC reboot featured DLC that let players control him. By this point, a belated appearance from Dante\u2019s katana-wielding twin brother is practically tradition \u2013 and I enjoy it every time. Because even if Devil May Cry has pulled the old \u201cYou can play as Vergil now\u201d move before, the character is a perennial favorite for a reason: He is a hell of a lot of fun to control, and that still holds true in this enhanced version of Devil May Cry 5.", "Before getting to what\u2019s new, you can rest assured that the special edition has all of the sword-slashing, gun-firing, monster-killing action of the original. The base campaign stars Nero, Dante, and a stranger named V as they team up to confront a powerful demonic enemy. With ridiculous weapons, fluid controls, and over-the-top cutscenes, it\u2019s a sequel that emphasizes what fans have always loved about Devil May Cry. But this new (and next-gen-exclusive) release takes that solid foundation and adds extra content and features to further improve the experience.", "One of my biggest complaints about Devil May Cry 5 was how the split focus kept you bouncing between three different heroes. One of my favorite things about the addition of Vergil is that he gets the whole game to himself; he isn\u2019t locked to a handful of specific missions like Nero, Dante, and V. You play him for the entire story mode, and I enjoyed diving into his repertoire and learning new tricks to use against familiar foes. For example, bosses that were originally designed for V\u2019s unique \u201ccontrol beasts from a distance\u201d style of fighting feel completely different now that you need to engage them in direct melee.", "As someone who has played all of Vergil\u2019s previous incarnations, I appreciate how this version incorporates both new and classic strategies. His playstyle remains interesting and precision-focused, with a concentration meter that rewards meticulous combat with access to different moves. His normal Devil Trigger is replaced by a summoned doppelganger instead, which is a new mechanic (for him) that is still consistent with what we\u2019ve seen of his capabilities. Vergil can take a demonic form by activating Sin Devil Trigger \u2013 a cool transformation that normally comes late in the story, but he has access to it right away. All of these touches set Vergil apart from his prior forms, as well as the other characters in this game. Because he needs to accomplish everything that Nero, Dante, and V can to complete all the missions, controlling Vergil conveys a powerful \u201cbest of all worlds\u201d sensation.", "Apart from the new character, Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition also has other upgrades. The next-gen hardware makes the game look amazing and run smoothly in general, but the new tech enables two specific options that I enjoyed. The first is turbo mode, which increases the game\u2019s speed. It threw off my timing a bit on some combos, but the extra boost makes the action even more frenetic. The second addition I liked is the Legendary Dark Knight difficulty mode, which is available from the beginning \u2026 though I wouldn\u2019t recommend starting there. The encounters on that setting are designed to test the limits of how many enemies can appear on screen at once, making it a crowded and chaotic challenge for people already familiar with the game.", "Devil May Cry 5 holds up, and I had a good time revisiting it in different ways. Vergil, turbo mode, and the Legendary Dark Knight difficulty are good additions \u2013 but fans have already seen all of those features in the series\u2019 previous special editions. They are still worthwhile, but don\u2019t expect any big surprises here. Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition is the best way to play an already-good game, but the fine-tuning doesn\u2019t elevate the experience to new heights."], "authors": ["Online Content Director", "Joe Joined The Game Informer Staff In He Loves Final Fantasy", "Mass Effect", "The Elder Scrolls", "Assassin'S Creed", "Metal Gear.
