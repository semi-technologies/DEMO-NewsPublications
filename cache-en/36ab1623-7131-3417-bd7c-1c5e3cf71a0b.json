There are Instagram accounts dedicated to tracking what the two are wearing, down to their very plain-looking AMI jeans. Like most all musical artists, they have a merchandise line. Though, unlike most artists, they launched a new, elevated version of their line today, moving past basic tees to something more sophisticated. In the past, their merch was mostly composed of T-shirts that featured two major codes of the group: a heart, which references unity and shared family values, as well as the abbreviation of \u201cQLF,\u201d which represents the French phrase \u201cQue la Famille,\u201d that the group has adopted as a slogan (it was also the name of their first album). Yet, their latest merch release feels more, well, fashion, as if it is a proper label. It hovers along the lines of a full collection.", "Photo: Courtesy of Rashidi Noah", "Titled \u201cB\u00e2timents\u201d\u2014\u201cbuildings\u201d in French\u2014the clothes feel like pieces that the brothers would wear in real life. There is a gray-white zip-up turtleneck sweater that I could have sworn I had seen Ademo don in a music video. In the mix is a simple black puffer that has \u201cQue La Famille\u201d printed on the chest, and there is a tan leather varsity jacket with a \u201cQ\u201d emblem on the front of the piece. While the clothes nicely reflect the men\u2019s personal styles, the tender connection that the two have with their upbringing also stands out. A cream denim jacket and jeans are artfully printed with a bird\u2019s-eye view of stark apartment complexes, and a windbreaker features a grainy color version. This nod to their background feels genuine, and also translates quite coolly into clothing.", "Photo: Courtesy of Rashidi Noah", "PNL\u2019s expansion of their merch is a solid route for the group. If the offering is visually pleasing, it can generate a cult following of its own\u2014just look at the fervor for Justin Bieber, Beyonc\u00e9, and Kanye West\u2019s respective wares. (Don\u2019t forget that each artist has launched separate labels too.) As for PNL? Their \u201cmerch\u201d separates them from the pack. Like many musical artists, I don\u2019t imagine PNL sitting in a studio and making the items themselves, but they certainly seem to have a strong input in how everything is being designed. Their clothes feel thoughtful, thanks to the detail-oriented designs and symbolic references. Look at their QLF heart, which was once simply screen printed onto a T-shirt\u2014it\u2019s now three-dimensionally embroidered onto a T-shirt. Brand growth looks good on Ademo and N.O.S, and it will certainly pay off.", "Photo: Courtesy of Rashidi Noah", "Photo: Courtesy of Rashidi Noah", "Photo: Courtesy of Rashidi Noah", "Photo: Courtesy of Rashidi Noah"], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["french", "rashidi", "best", "merch", "artists", "courtesy", "clothes", "printed", "feels", "created", "noahphoto", "pnl", "group"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
