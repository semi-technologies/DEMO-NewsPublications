Saying,", "\"Well, she was very rehearsed and that kind of drove some people crazy. What did she want to do? What was the headline that she wanted to come out of that that Raphael Warnock was a radical liberal? Yep. Yeah a liberal, So she said that I think 15 times at least, and that if you were to walk away from anything in that debate, it might be one that. He's a radical liberal from her perspective two that what I said, that he was not going to shut down the idea of attacking the court and that three, you know, Warnock is a pretty conversational, good communicator. He's a pastor. He has a way with people, in a way with words. And it's kind of easy on the ears and easy to listen to.
