Assuming you have already had something fried or salty (or both) with your aperitif, and that there is a feast ahead, here are two suggestions that tick all the boxes: a sweet and subtle prawn, fennel and celery salad, and a ricotta and spinach bake, which is somewhere between a souffl\u00e9 and a frittata, and deep forest green.", "Prawn, celery and fennel salad (insalata di gamberi e sedano \u2013 pictured above)", "A simple but curiously good salad, thanks to the lemon zest and nigella seeds, which are reminiscent of onions, black pepper and oregano.
