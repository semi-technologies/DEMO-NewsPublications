Be connected for emergencies. For example, you can agree [on] a code word with a friend or family member, which tells them if you are facing an emergency. Begin to build a network and gain knowledge.", "\u201cIt\u2019s sad to say, but you can\u2019t assume all friends and family will always want to believe and support you,\u201d the mother of six cautioned. \u201cOften it will be strangers who help. Or other victims, support groups, or faith groups. Above all, be careful. Only you really know the danger you are in, and until you find your support outside, you may feel quite alone.\u201d", "According to UN Women, 243 million women and girls were abused by an intimate partner in the past year, the outlet noted.

Another thing we can all do is educate ourselves. Learn about domestic violence. Learn how trauma affects our health and can lead to biological changes, particularly in children. Take these issues seriously.\u201d", "\u201cTake it seriously and stand by them,\u201d Jolie shared. \u201cListen to them. Don\u2019t judge them. Try to understand the huge emotional, financial and legal pressures they are likely facing, including the pressure to stay silent about what has happened to them. And be aware that they may well be suffering trauma and PTSD.\"", "Jolie is supporting the United Nation\u2019s 16 Days of Activism campaign, an initiative against gender-based violence.
