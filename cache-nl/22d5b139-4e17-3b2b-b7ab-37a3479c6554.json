But it does mean we have time to work on ideas that we weren\u2019t getting round to before.\u201d", "In Munt\u2019s experience, not many people have left the city. \u201cI have a lot of friends with fixed-term contracts, and they\u2019re doing OK. On the other hand, I do know a few people with more insecure freelance jobs who\u2019ve been forced to go home. They can\u2019t afford the high rents, and have had to go back to their parents.
