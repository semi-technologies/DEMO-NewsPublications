The fashion designer, known for her grown-up silhouettes that instantly give the wearer an air of worldly sophistication, considers herself a true devotee to aesthetics. \u201cI wish I didn't have to design everything. It's kind of like a curse.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean that Getty doesn\u2019t like things designed by others. In fact, she likes them so much she\u2019s created an online shop where she\u2019s selling a few of her favorite things (objects for the home) in her Gift Studio.", "It\u2019s a collection of items she\u2019s discovered and pooled together, the first time RosettaGetty.com has offered product that\u2019s not their own. \u201cI love to support artisans that make beautiful things, so it made sense right now to figure out a way to offer those things to my customers,\u201d Getty says.", "Incense matches from Hibi.

They're from this Japanese company that has been making incense for almost 100 years.\u201d Based in Awaji Island, Hibi was founded in 1936 and all their products continue to be made following the tradition of Japanese incense-making.", "Potpourri as you've never seen it before from Mad et Len. Photo: Courtesy of Rosetta Getty", "There\u2019s also a potpourri that looks more like an art piece from Mad et Len. Getty explains it took some convincing to get Mad et Len on her site because the company is so discerning. Mad et Len\u2019s candles and potpourri are handcrafted in the bucolic mountain French Alps village of Saint Julien de Verdun. And you\u2019ll want everything just for the vessels\u2014a potpourri, for example, comes as scented wax (shaped like rocks) in a slate-like iron box. This was a discovery the Los Angeles-based designer made while driving up the 101 to take her kids on a school camping trip in Santa Barbara.", "There\u2019s also going to be a rotating flower arrangement from Pretend Plants & Flowers, a company Getty considers to be the next generation of florists. Currently available is a lace-leaf-filled arrangement in refreshing shades of green.", "Most everything in The Gift Studio is under $200 and it\u2019s an assortment that Getty plans to continue to offer indefinitely. Per Getty, gift-giving is an art that should be practiced long after the holidays end."], "authors": ["Lilah Ramzi", "Lilah Ramz"], "keywords": ["rosetta", "mad", "incense", "gift", "favorite", "presents", "et", "things", "shes", "company", "studio", "len", "potpourri", "getty"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
