On December 10th President Donald Trump announced the latest breakthrough in his diplomatic push on behalf of the Jewish state. Morocco, the Arab world\u2019s oldest monarchy, will become the fourth Arab state in as many months to establish diplomatic relations with Israel (following the UAE , Bahrain and Sudan).", "The agreement is a win for Israel, and also for Morocco. As part of the deal, Mr Trump recognised Morocco\u2019s annexation of Western Sahara. The territory, slightly larger than Britain, is also claimed by the Polisario Front, a nationalist movement backed by Algeria. Mr Trump\u2019s intervention comes amid provocations by both sides that risk restarting a war that ended three decades ago.", "That old conflict kicked off in 1975, when Morocco annexed Western Sahara after Spain, the colonial power, pulled out. Polisario, which the UN considers the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, resisted\u2014but was outgunned. With Morocco in control of about two-thirds of the territory, and Polisario controlling the other third, the UN brokered a ceasefire deal in 1991 that promised the Sahrawis a referendum on independence. Morocco, though, stands in the way.", "Morocco\u2019s treatment of the Sahrawis is in some ways like Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians. Over the years Morocco has used subsidies and tax breaks to convince thousands of its people to move to Western Sahara in an effort to cement its control. Sahrawi protests are suppressed; activists talk of torture by the security services. But the kingdom has also spent billions of dollars fixing up the territory.", "Once of primarily symbolic value, Western Sahara\u2019s strategic value has been growing. The side held by Polisario has little in the way of resources. But the portion controlled by Morocco is rich in phosphates and fish. Large reserves of oil may lie offshore. The kingdom also sees Western Sahara as its gateway to west Africa, which buys up Moroccan exports.", "So the kingdom is working hard to transform its de facto control of Western Sahara into something more legitimate. Over the past year it has convinced around 20 African and Arab states to recognise its claim. The UN seems to have all but given up on overseeing the referendum. A UN Security Council resolution in October extending the mandate of the UN \u2019s peacekeeping mission did not mention the vote, though it is called the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.", "\u201cMorocco\u2019s serious, credible and realistic autonomy proposal is the ONLY basis for a just and lasting solution for enduring peace and prosperity!\u201d tweeted Mr Trump, referring to a proposal Polisario does not feel is serious or credible. \u201cMorocco recognized the United States in 1777. It is thus fitting we recognize their sovereignty over the Western Sahara.\u201d Indeed, both acts neglected the opinion of the indigenous population. President-elect Joe Biden could adopt a more even-handed approach.", "Inside Morocco, the king\u2019s decision to normalise relations with Israel is controversial. Many Islamists and leftists oppose the move. But most Moroccans seem to consider America\u2019s recognition of the kingdom\u2019s claim over Western Sahara more important than the kingdom\u2019s recognition of Israel. They have long called for putting their needs before those of the Palestinians. A popular slogan, \u201cTaza before Gaza\u201d, refers to cities in Morocco and Palestine."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["israel", "morocco", "polisario", "trump", "arab", "roiling", "western", "peace", "sahara", "desert", "deal", "referendum", "kingdom", "heat", "israelmorocco", "mr"], "pubDate": "2020-12-16T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
