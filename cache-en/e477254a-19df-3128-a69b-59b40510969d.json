Most were children of the Great Depression.", "They had joined the Navy and Marines not out of a quest to see the world but for a steady paycheck. The $5 or $10 many sent home every month out of their meager pay of $36 put food on the family table for younger siblings.", "JAMES CARAFANO: US SHOULDN'T REENTER IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL \u2014 IRAN SPONSORS TERRORISM AND SEEKS NUCLEAR WEAPONS", "In a world at peace, there had not seemed to be any serious danger to brothers serving together on warships. Family ties were judged as good thing. An older brother in uniform was better than any recruiting poster.", "Economic necessity aside, the decision to enlist was particularly easy when an older brother led the way. As one sailor wrote his mother, \u201cI am safer on this battleboat than I would be driving back and forth to work if I was home.\u201d", "Thomas Murdock stuck it out in the poverty of the farmland of northern Alabama until he was 21 and then took a bus ride to Birmingham to enlist.

They all ended up serving together on the Arizona.", "On the morning of Dec. 7, Thomas was ashore in Honolulu with his wife, but brothers Luther and Melvin were at their battle stations tending to boilers in the bowels of the Arizona.

Left unsaid was the sad reality that by the beginning of the 80th anniversary of 1941 events, there would be so very few of them left.", "The 78 brothers on the Arizona were literal brothers in blood.
