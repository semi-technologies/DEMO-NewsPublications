Miscarriage is common \u2014 as many as 15 percent of known pregnancies end in a first-trimester loss. We have guides on miscarriage, stillbirth (far less common and incredibly heartbreaking), ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilized egg lands somewhere other than the uterus, also rare), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and a beautiful essay from Amber Scorah about having a child after losing a child.", "***", "I had a miscarriage in between my two girls. I went in for an ultrasound at around seven weeks, and there was no heartbeat. My period is so irregular that I had to wait two additional weeks to confirm that the pregnancy was not progressing properly. My obstetrician couldn\u2019t definitively date the pregnancy because he couldn\u2019t definitively date the ovulation, so I trudged to multiple radiologists for multiple disappointing ultrasounds over 14 days.", "I expected to feel sad during this painful two-week wait, and after \u2014 and I absolutely did. A guttural sadness that would take months to lift.", "What I didn\u2019t anticipate was that I would feel a lot of other things, and that the emotional ground would continue to shift under my feet. I felt relief when I was able to take a new job right around when I would have been due to give birth; I knew I wouldn\u2019t have been able to take it had I carried that pregnancy to term. Then I felt guilty about feeling relieved. I felt anger \u2014 spiky and random, popping up unexpectedly and without apparent trigger. And most appalling to me was the envy I felt toward women who were pregnant, successfully. An acquaintance of mine was due around when I would have been, and I could not stand to be around her during her pregnancy. When she tried to make plans, I made excuses.", "There\u2019s a myriad of responses to loss, said Julia Bueno, a psychotherapist and the author of \u201cThe Brink of Being: Talking About Miscarriage.\u201d \u201cThere may well not be any grief,\u201d Bueno said, and the grief some women feel is \u201cexquisitely nuanced, powerful and profound.\u201d If the miscarriage is in the first trimester, it may also be hidden, Bueno said, because you don\u2019t always look pregnant to the outside world, and it\u2019s not customary to reveal a pregnancy until you\u2019re past 12 weeks.", "Partners of pregnant women may also feel a range of emotions. As technology allows us to know we\u2019re pregnant just after a missed period, it allows partners to become bonded to babies far earlier than they might have been in previous generations. There\u2019s a case study in Bueno\u2019s book about a woman who miscarried twice, whose husband was grieving deeply. \u201cHe bought the pregnancy test. He saw that test emerge \u2014 he was drawn into it,\u201d Bueno said. He was already forging a relationship with the baby that he had to mourn, too.", "Nearly five years after my loss, I don\u2019t think about the miscarriage much anymore. I was lucky to have a second child, which is what I desperately wanted, and that helped me. But lots of families still feel complicated grief even after having additional children. Bueno lost twin girls, Florence and Matilda, at 22 weeks, and she had three miscarriages as well. She went on to have two boys, and for her, \u201cthe nourishment and joy runs alongside the grief.\u201d Bueno told me about an oral history she had read from a woman with nine children. That woman had a miscarriage, too, and though she was in her 80s at the time of the oral history, she still felt the loss acutely despite her sizable brood.", "If you know someone who has experienced a loss, Bueno said, \u201cerr on the side of compassionate curiosity.\u201d This could mean saying you\u2019re sorry for a loss, and then asking something open-ended, like, \u201cTell me what it meant to you,\u201d as it allows for the many kinds of emotion someone might feel. Be prepared for any response \u2014 a woman may not want to talk about it at all, or she may want to talk about the gory viscera. I recall making extremely dark jokes about what came out of me in the aftermath. Those physical side effects, \u201cthat stuff needs to be talked about,\u201d Bueno said. Otherwise we run the risk of women feeling \u201cicky and shameful and abnormal\u201d about what they\u2019ve experienced.", "We need to make cultural space for every single kind of reaction to loss \u2014 there will always be a gamut of responses.
