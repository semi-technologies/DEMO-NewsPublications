In office, he has converted anti-immigrant politics into policy. About half as many migrants are reaching America four years after Mr Trump began limiting legal immigration. Asylum and refugee admissions have been sharply curtailed, too. Unauthorised immigrants have been particularly unwelcome in Mr Trump\u2019s America, though the judiciary has resisted some of his moves.", "Last summer the Supreme Court blocked Mr Trump\u2019s attempt to scrap Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a programme preventing the deportation of immigrants brought to America as children. It also declined to help the administration fight \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, jurisdictions where local authorities limit co-ordination with federal authorities enforcing immigration rules. A year earlier the justices had told Mr Trump he could not add a citizenship question to the 2020 census\u2014a query that could have deterred both legal and undocumented immigrant families from completing the questionnaire.", "With only 51 days left in the Oval Office, Mr Trump has another opportunity to push his nativist agenda\u2014and this time his move could alter the balance of power in Congress for the coming decade. But, again, the Supreme Court gets the final word. In Trump v New York, to be argued on November 30th, the court will scrutinise the outgoing president\u2019s novel attempt to change how seats in the House of Representatives\u2014and therefore electoral votes for upcoming presidential elections\u2014are divided up among the states. Billions of dollars of federal funding could be at stake, too.", "Federal law charges the Secretary of Commerce with sending decennial census data to the president by December 31st. The note must contain \u201cthe tabulation of total population by states\u201d so that the president can, by January 10th, send a report to Congress laying out \u201cthe number of representatives to which each state would be entitled\u201d. Until 2020 there was no question as to who counted for representation: all people \u201cinhabiting\u201d the state, irrespective of immigration status. But in July Mr Trump released a memorandum announcing that \u201caliens who are not in a lawful immigration status\u201d would be excluded from the \u201capportionment base\u201d used to calculate each state\u2019s share of the 435 House seats. Accordingly, the memorandum directs the commerce secretary\u2014\u201dto the extent practicable\u201d\u2014to list each state\u2019s total population minus the number of undocumented immigrants.", "Why the change? Mr Trump argues that keeping some 12m aliens out of the mix is \u201cmore consonant with the principles of representative democracy underpinning our system of government\u201d. Citing the \u201cperverse incentives\u201d of current rules, the memo asserts: states that \u201chobble federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws\u201d should not be rewarded by augmenting their representation in Congress.", "Once more, Mr Trump is citing democratic principles to weaken Democratic-leaning states. In 2018 the administration claimed its move to add a citizenship question to the census was designed to better enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965\u2014a law protecting minority voters from discrimination at the polls. This rationale was suspicious from the start, as Republicans had sought to undermine the law in the courts for decades and managed to weaken it greatly in Shelby County v Holder, a 2013 Supreme Court decision. Evidence later emerged that the real objective was to dampen response rates among immigrant households and shift power to Republicans. Now the Trump team is more transparent about its aim. \u201c[O]ne state is home to more than 2.2m illegal aliens\u201d, the memo reads. If those unauthorised immigrants were to be included in the population base, the state would get \u201ctwo or three more congressional seats than would otherwise be allocated\u201d.", "The unnamed state that stands to lose House seats under Mr Trump\u2019s new calculus is California, which is overwhelmingly Democratic and has 53 representatives in the House. But the advantage to Republicans may not be as great as Mr Trump hopes: Texas and Florida, which both lean towards Republicans, stand to lose a seat each, according to a Pew study, whereas Minnesota, Alabama and Ohio (a mixed partisan bag) may profit from the revised formula.", "A number of immigrant-rights organisations, and some states led by New York, sued to block Mr Trump\u2019s policy. In September a special three-judge district court in the Southern District of New York sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the Census Act and Reapportionment Act, both in force since 1929, require that census data\u2014and census data alone\u2014inform the allotment of congressional seats. The court also ruled that these laws prohibit the president from excluding illegal aliens from the population base. \u201cThe ordinary meaning of the word \u2018person\u2019 is \u2018human\u2019 or \u2018individual\u2019\u201d, the judges wrote, \u201cand surely includes citizens and non-citizens alike\u201d. The Trump administration had argued that visiting diplomats, business travellers and tourists are excluded from the census, so immigrants could be, too. These examples are not \u201cremotely convincing\u201d, the court held. For these individuals, in contrast to immigrants who have made America their home for years, \u201cthe United States is not their \u2018usual residence\u2019\u201d.", "With the December 31st deadline approaching, the Supreme Court agreed to expedite Mr Trump\u2019s appeal. Mr Trump\u2019s lawyers say the president is the \u201cultimate decision-maker\u201d on apportionment and \u201cretains discretion to make policy judgments\u201d. They point to a 1992 Supreme Court case, Franklin v Massachusetts, for support. In response, challengers rely on both federal law and the Fourteenth Amendment, which says House seats must be apportioned according to states\u2019 \u201crespective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.\u201d Since untaxed Indians are mentioned as a carve-out, the plaintiffs say, the framers clearly meant to include everyone else in the census count.", "The Trump administration\u2019s arguments on the merits of the policy are strained; the challengers seem to have the law and history on their side. But that may not end up mattering. In order to sue, plaintiffs need to show that a policy causes them a specific harm: a threshold requirement known as \u201cstanding\u201d. In September the lower court found that the exclusion of undocumented persons would have a \u201cchilling effect on census participation\u201d, which constituted tangible harm. But the census count ended in mid-October, removing that hook for standing. The plaintiffs have other claims\u2014including the risk of losing federal funds or seats in Congress\u2014but those were too speculative and remote in the district court\u2019s eyes.", "The Supreme Court may dismiss the case for the same reason, which would allow Mr Trump to proceed with his scheme. But such a win could be temporary: once the president sends Congress his apportionment plan, states that stand to lose seats would have a solid case for standing and might renew the lawsuit. The plan could be thwarted in other ways: by Census Bureau delays in reporting the raw numbers, by the difficulty of reckoning the number of illegal aliens or by the incoming Biden administration that may try to reverse the exclusion. Undaunted, Mr Trump is keeping up his fight to make an unprecedented and lasting mark on the political landscape before he leaves office.", "Dig deeper:", "Read our latest coverage of the presidential transition, and then sign up for Checks and Balance, our weekly newsletter and podcast on American politics."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["reaches", "count", "congressional", "shift", "states", "state", "trumps", "court", "census", "trump", "seats", "immigration", "mr", "supreme", "losing", "plan"], "pubDate": "2020-11-29T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
