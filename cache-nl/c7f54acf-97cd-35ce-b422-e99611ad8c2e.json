Beeld ANP", "This is revealed by new figures from the Research, Information and Statistics service of the municipality of Amsterdam, presented by Jeroen Slot, head of research, during the \u2018State of the City\u2019 event in the Stadsschouwburg on Tuesday evening.", "The average wealth of Amsterdam residents has gone up by five per cent since 2004. This is scarcely surprising, as the city is growing, the economy is doing well, and 75,000 jobs have been created since 2014. But the rise in wealth benefits only the well-educated. Their wealth is six percentage points above the average.", "In addition, wealth is unevenly divided across the city. Residents with only secondary school level, or lower, score poorly; their wealth has declined over recent years. \u201cThe city has a large group of people who have been left behind,\u201d Slot says.", "Great Divide", "During the programme, historians Geert Mak and James Kennedy noted a history of inequality in Amsterdam. \u201cAs far back as the Golden Age, when large amounts of capital flowed into the city, it was spread unevenly,\u201d said Kennedy, who is attached to Utrecht University. And Mak, an author, said that history showed that too much segregation led to serious problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some major disturbances here,\u201d he noted. He believes Amsterdam\u2019s quality of life has declined over the past 30 years as a result of increasing segregation. \u201cDogmatic insistence on the free market has led to the loss of many public values,\u201d Mak said.", "Barbara Baarsma, an economist and director at Rabobank Amsterdam, pointed to rising inequality between rapidly growing Amsterdam and the surrounding region. This inequality could be seen in the outcome of the elections to the upper house of parliament representing the provinces earlier this year. Whereas the city voted for progressive parties, the region went to the conservative Forum for Democracy. \u201cThis divide is widening. This divergence led to the victory of Donald Trump and to Brexit in the United States and Britain respectively.\u201d", "Baarsma believes the city should build more housing for people on moderate incomes in order to counter the inequality. At the moment, only 5.6 per cent of the housing market is aimed at those on lower mid-range incomes. \u201cThey see the city growing and flourishing, but are not part of it,\u201d she says."], "authors": ["Michiel Couzy", "Translation", "Rohan Minogue"], "keywords": ["amsterdam", "wealth", "mak", "led", "residents", "growing", "unevenly", "cent", "city", "increased", "inequality"], "pubDate": "2019-05-23T15:55:00+02:00", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
