I\u2019m probably guilty of writing a line or two about the mood-lifting, productivity-boosting experience of getting dressed\u2014that whole \u201clook good, feel good\u201d thing. In reality, I don\u2019t always take my advice; there are days I don\u2019t change out of sweats. Usually this happens when I\u2019m just too swamped to think about an outfit before it\u2019s too late to bother. Despite working from home for nine (sometimes agonizing) months, I\u2019ve yet to successfully limit my screen time or figure out \u201cwork hours\u201d: From the minute I\u2019m awake, I\u2019m on my phone or laptop, checking emails, starting on my next deadline, and losing track of time.", "Do I feel great on those days? Not exactly. It isn\u2019t just that I don\u2019t feel professional or stylish when I\u2019m in the same old leggings and sweatshirt, but I don\u2019t feel like myself, either. Yes, I\u2019m someone who cares deeply about personal style, and I really do feel better when I\u2019ve pulled myself together. But I also care about supporting designers, particularly independent and sustainability-focused ones. Even when I\u2019m not explicitly thinking about it, wearing their clothes makes me happy and fills me with the confidence that I\u2019m expressing my truest self to the world\u2014my taste, my personality, and my values.", "A call with Bel Jacobs, an Extinction Rebellion activist and former fashion editor, further motivated me to get it together. We were talking about ethical consumption and voting with your wallet, and whether they\u2019re a distraction from the bigger, systemic changes the world really needs. Was it a waste of time to pat ourselves on the back for making conscious purchases and buying from nice people? Some would say yes, but Jacobs put it this way: \u201cI always tell people, you have to live in alignment with your values. If you don\u2019t want people to suffer, don\u2019t buy products from brands that make people suffer. If you don\u2019t want animals to suffer, don\u2019t buy from brands who make them suffer. There\u2019s a great peace in living your life that way.\u201d Her words stuck with me, because as insignificant as my own choices may seem in the grand scheme of climate change and the exploitation of garment workers, every action does have an impact. If we all became hyper-conscious of what we buy, the domino effect would be huge."], "authors": ["Emily Farra", "Emily Farr"], "keywords": ["way", "clothing", "dont", "suffer", "vogue", "buy", "im", "vintage", "feel", "mixes", "yes", "sustainable", "work", "wearing", "really", "secondhand", "editor"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
