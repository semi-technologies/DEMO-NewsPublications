Disney\u2019s decision to supersize its streaming offerings mirrors WarnerMedia\u2019s recent announcement that it will release its full slate of 2021 motion pictures directly to HBO Max. Directors and agents are wailing and gnashing their teeth (Christopher Nolan loudest of all) at media companies\u2019 apparent abandonment of theatrical releases. But a different contingent\u2014media pirates\u2014let out a huge cheer at the prospect of so much quality content premiering online next year. As Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter noted, \u201c[Warner] is pretending that pirates won\u2019t pounce as soon as these films are streaming on HBO Max,\u201d but pounce, they certainly will. Media piracy has seen several golden ages before, including Napster\u2019s heyday (1999-2002) and The Pirate Bay\u2019s peak years (2003-2008), but Warner and Disney\u2019s new strategies all but assure 2021 will be the dawning of a platinum age. What we\u2019re about to see will go down in pirate lore forever.", "WIRED OPINION ABOUT Abigail De Kosnik is the director of the Berkeley Center for New Media and an associate professor at UC Berkeley.", "Despite the media industries\u2019 ongoing attempts to impede internet piracy of films, television episodes, music, video games, and other digital cultural products, the peer-to-peer infrastructure through which millions of users illicitly upload and download copyrighted files has been fully functional for over 20 years. My spouse, Benjamin De Kosnik, and I have developed a suite of tools for sampling BitTorrent activity around specific media files, and our research shows that online piracy was already thriving thanks to streaming. The final episode of HBO\u2019s hit Game of Thrones was downloaded 32 million times over the 15 weeks after its airing, and Disney\u2019s 2020 film Mulan was downloaded 21.4 million times in the 12 weeks after its release. (Our data does not reflect the total size of pirate activity, since each downloaded file can then be distributed and streamed to thousands of viewers.)", "Historically, pirates have suffered from a \u201czero-day\u201d problem: When a film debuted in theaters, there were no perfect digital copies of the film that could be circulated; pirates either had to pay to see it in person, watch a low-quality \u201ccam\u201d version (made by someone in a theater covertly recording the movie), or resign themselves to waiting for months until a Blu-Ray release of the movie would be issued. But next year, when all 17 new Warner films premiere on HBO Max, pirates will immediately have perfect copies to share.", "But they won\u2019t be the only beneficiaries. This piracy boon will be good for media companies and content creators as well, even if they lose out on some ticket revenue and subscription dollars. In 2021, more people will watch films on their release date than ever before, because the Warner films will travel into homes through HBO Max and through the pirate network. Many pirates are also good fans, and they will heavily promote the Warner films they like on social media, which will drive up HBO Max subscriptions and increase the cultural value of whichever of the offerings they like best. Pirates could make some of the Warner 2021 films legends, by acting quickly to cement their reputations among movie lovers.", "2021 will be a piracy bonanza, but there\u2019s no reason to think it will be a one-time jubilee. Rather, it will mark the start of a new era for media corporations. Warner doesn\u2019t stand alone in its decision to drop its planned theatrical releases on its streaming platform right away. Disney shifted first, debuting both Hamilton and Mulan on Disney+ in 2020 when the long-running Covid-19 crisis made cinemagoing either impossible or highly inadvisable. And because of Disney and Warner\u2019s moves this year and next, it\u2019s likely that, post-pandemic, studios will opt to release some big-name titles on streaming and in theaters simultaneously, and will open some titles on streaming only. In other words, the celebration probably won\u2019t be limited to 2021, as pirates will get perfect zero-day copies of many motion pictures beyond next year."], "authors": ["Abigail De Kosnik", "Abigail De Kosni"], "keywords": ["release", "platinum", "media", "piracy", "hbo", "launch", "disney", "films", "warner", "pirates", "age", "streaming", "2021", "max"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
