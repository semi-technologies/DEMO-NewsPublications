Photograph: PA", "You are pretty much the most fashionable man on the planet right now. Burberry, Celine, Emporio Armani, Valentino and Kent & Curwen all unveiled sleek new duffel coats this season, which is very kind of them, and you\u2019re very flattered. However, you can\u2019t help but feel that they might be using you to their advantage. Hard stare.", "Mostly Bs You are Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Warm, comfortable, padded: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Photograph: Getty Images", "You are a sensible man who requires warmth and comfort above all else. Luckily, there are plenty of long-line padded jackets to choose from. Iceberg\u2019s is a traditional sporty zip-up, Balenciaga\u2019s has strong full-body coverage, and Fendi\u2019s is elaborately patterned. But why not shell out for Craig Green x Moncler\u2019s coat, which looks as if it has about a dozen full-sized pillows Velcroed on to it? Perfect for quick nap in the middle of a dull no-score draw.", "Mostly Cs You are Morpheus.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Leather trench: Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) in The Matrix. Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros", "Or, more specifically, you\u2019re someone who weirdly made the decision to let The Matrix inform your main philosophies of the world. You rage against all the injustices that men like you have had to endure. But, hey, at least you can look stylish when you do it, as the silly, military leather trenchcoats you favour are back in vogue. Alexander McQueen, Salvatore Ferragamo and Berluti all went hard for them this season. However, I\u2019d suggest buying Balenciaga\u2019s ridiculous face-covering coat instead. It\u2019ll keep you warm on the way to the cinema, to watch Joker 15 times in a row.", "Mostly Ds You are Kurt Cobain.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tatty-looking leopardskin: Kurt Cobain. Photograph: Jesse Froham", "You\u2019re edgy and eclectic, and you like to pave your own way when it comes to fashion. But let\u2019s pretend that all the charity shops in the world have closed down and you\u2019re forced to buy your tatty-looking leopardskin coats from a high-end fashion designer. Versace has one this season, as do John Lawrence Sullivan, Marni and No 21. You\u2019re spoilt for choice.", "Mostly Es You are Liberace.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Glass beads a-go-go: Liberace. Photograph: Alamy", "I mean, no, you\u2019re not. Liberace once wore a suit made of glass beads. The closest AW19 gets to that level of decadence is a bunch of pink coats. They\u2019re nice pink coats \u2013 Berluti\u2019s is shockingly vibrant, Acne Studios\u2019 is arguably the best-looking coat of the entire season \u2013 but come back to me when they\u2019ve unveiled a tuxedo with your name spelt in diamonds across the back.", "\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."], "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
