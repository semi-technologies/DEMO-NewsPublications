It's a series I have over 20 playthroughs of and many more to come, it's one of those stories that feels like coming home.

With the most recent comic series and Tevinter Nights taking fans to the land of blood mages, magisters, and social injustice (and also the oh my damn Fenris and Dorian characters), the next entry in the Dragon Age franchise looks to make those side stories add up in a big way. Much like the books aided in setting up the world of the previous three games, Mage Killer and Tevinter Nights have set the stage beautifully for Dragon Age 4.", "Dragon Age 4 remains largely a mystery. The first time we learned about the newest game was back in 2018 at The Game Awards.
