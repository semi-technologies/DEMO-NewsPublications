Not only would Biles have to redraw the plan, she would also have to interact with USAG another year. \u201cWe were gripping at the bars, and I just started crying. Another year of dealing with USAG. That, I don\u2019t know if I can take.\u201d", "At first, Biles wasn\u2019t sure how she would stay in shape. Adria asked if she had any dumbbells at home. (\u201cFirst of all, in the gym, I don\u2019t even use dumbbells,\u201d Biles told me. \u201cWhy would I have a dumbbell set at home?\u201d) Eventually she started improvising. She did a \u201ctwerk-out\u201d class she found on YouTube. She went to a local track and did 100-meter sprints (a first). She even participated in an internet meme\u2014the handstand challenge, in which celebrities like Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal did handstands against a wall and, while inverted, slowly put on T-shirts. Biles did a free handstand (no wall) and held it for nearly a minute, removing her sweatpants with her toes.", "Biles settled into something of a routine. She had Zoom sessions with her coaches, Cecile and Laurent Landi, three days a week. She walked her French bulldog, Lilo. (Five weeks in, she adopted a second one, a puppy she named Rambo.) And she did more adulting, fully inhabiting a new house she bought last year and expanding her repertoire of slow-cooker recipes (burrito bowls, pork chops). She also processed the breakup of her near three-year relationship with former national-team gymnast Stacey Ervin Jr. They parted ways in early March, just before her trip to New York. (\u201cIt\u2019s hard being young and having that long of a relationship and then ending it. But it was for the best.\u201d) Quarantine life wasn\u2019t easy. Aside from a yearlong hiatus after Rio, she had never worked out so little or had so much time alone with her thoughts.", "\u201cI think for athletes, it\u2019s hard for us to be out of our element for such a long period of time,\u201d Biles said. \u201cThat kind of throws your whole balance off. Because you go to work out and you release endorphins. You get any anger out. It\u2019s kind of our oasis. Without that, you\u2019re stuck at home with your own thoughts. I\u2019ve kind of let myself live in those thoughts, to read more deeply into them. At the gym, it\u2019s a great distraction, so I never really live with my thoughts. Now it\u2019s like, Okay, what are the depths of it? Sometimes I\u2019ll write down little notes about how I\u2019m feeling. Like, Today, it\u2019s shit. Or Okay, I feel good, I feel content with this, this is the right decision, we need to make a plan. And then other days, I\u2019m like, Are you joking? Another 15 months? I don\u2019t know if I can do that. So it\u2019s been nice to be able to live with them because I avoid them a lot of the time. That\u2019s my way of protecting my mind.\u201d"], "authors": ["Annie Leibovit"], "keywords": ["wasnt", "dont", "simone", "overcoming", "feel", "pandemic", "abuse", "thoughts", "olympics", "way", "worked", "postponed", "kind", "training", "live", "hard", "biles"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
