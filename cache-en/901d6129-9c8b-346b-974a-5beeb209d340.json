Now picture what would happen if it sat outside in the summer heat for a couple of hours. Mousse would morph into ooze, tiered cakes would start to slip and slide, and delicate chocolate decorations would melt into unrecognizable blobs.", "The truth is, you don\u2019t have to imagine it\u2014just watch The Great British Baking Show on Netflix, where creating elaborate baked goods in oppressive heat has become the main drama. The show, whose season finale appeared on Friday for US viewers, has always been filmed outdoors under an iconic white tent around England. But in 2020, a year from hell, the famously temperate British summer became too warm for the finicky process of baking. Heat is now the show\u2019s central villain.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like Satan\u2019s kitchen in here,\u201d Laura Adlington, one of this year\u2019s bakers, joked in an episode filmed in July. Following another sweat-inducing day in the tent, Paul Hollywood\u2014the steely-eyed judge famous for his bread expertise\u2014told his fellow cohosts that he had to \u201cpeel his jeans off\u201d at the end of the day. They winced and laughed uncomfortably.", "The show conjures everything many Americans love about England\u2014the rolling hills, the lilting accents, and the dry humor. The contestants are actually nice to each other for once, a relief after all the trash-talking you expect from American reality TV.", "For millions of viewers, The Great British Bake Off (its UK title) has been a welcome retreat from reality. When the first season aired in 2010, its creators probably didn\u2019t expect it would turn into a decade-long cultural phenomenon, let alone imagine the trouble posed by rising temperatures. The United Kingdom has been seeing frequent and unprecedented heat waves over the last decade. In Berkshire, where half of the seasons were filmed, the average maximum temperature in July has risen more than 1 degree C (nearly 2 degrees F) over the past several decades.", "The producers attempted to give viewers a semblance of normalcy in a very strange year. No one wore masks on the show, and the pandemic remains out of sight; the cast and crew had to live on set and take regular Covid-19 tests so they could go on like normal. The nasal swabs were, of course, all off-camera.", "The Great British Baking Show has encountered many temperature-related disasters in a decade-long run. Season 9 brought us Terry Hartill\u2019s chocolate Eiffel Tower cake, which leaned, then toppled, in the heat. And no one could forget #BinGate from Season 5, one of the show\u2019s biggest controversies. One baker had mistakenly taken another contestant\u2019s baked Alaska out of the freezer, and in a fit of rage, Iain Watters, the baker who had been \u201csabotaged,\u201d threw his melting creation in the bin and stalked out of the tent. Last year, for the first time\u2014and in perhaps a subtle nod to global warming\u2014contestants were given fans for their worktables.", "The heat has become an increasingly familiar character. The camera pans over shot after shot of the searing sun. The judges explain an upcoming challenge, once again emphasizing that the heat will make it even more difficult. (Butter, the star ingredient of many baked goods, turns into liquid at 94 F [34 C], and starts to soften long before that.) To cool down during challenges, the bakers have started wearing wet rags around their necks that leave damp patches on their aprons."], "authors": ["Kate Yoder", "Kate Yode"], "keywords": ["warming", "baked", "baking", "bake", "tent", "global", "victim", "great", "british", "summer", "heat", "season", "filmed", "viewers"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
