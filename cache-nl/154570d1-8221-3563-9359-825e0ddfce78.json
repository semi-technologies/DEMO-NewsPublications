Beeld Lou Wolfs/ Toonkunst Rotterdam", "The music is carefully chosen: Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019 Les fleurs et les arbres is about the consolations of nature in difficult times. It\u2019s a new work in the choir\u2019s repertoire and, from her little box on the computer screen, conductor Maria van Nieukerken explains the potential vocal pitfalls. \u201cDon\u2019t hang on to the long notes for too long, sopranos,\u201d she warns. Then they rehearse the song, with her playing the piano and singing, and more than fifty choristers joining her at their computers, microphones switched off, everyone singing to themselves.", "So what\u2019s the secret to managing a choir during Covid? Van Nieukerken should know: she conducts several of them, including chamber vocal ensemble PA\u2019dam and the country\u2019s oldest oratorio choir, Toonkunst Rotterdam, established in 1829.", "She says the answer is investing lots of energy. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a great deal you can\u2019t do. We can\u2019t meet, and we can\u2019t really sing together or perform in public. We miss the intimacy and togetherness we feel when we sing in a group, which is difficult for a choir. But there also some things you can do, and we do them.\u201d", "Keeping time", "Van Nieukerken uses a combination of Zoom, WhatsApp and YouTube. The oratorio choir holds a digital rehearsal a couple of times a week, and she has managed to come up with something workable in the months since the pandemic began.", "\u201cSinging together on Zoom is a non-starter, because it\u2019s impossible to keep time, so I play the piano and the choristers sing to themselves at home. We go through the piece together, and I try to make it fun. The rehearsal begins with voice exercises, but we also do games.", "\u201cBut it\u2019s all stopped since the new Covid measures were introduced. We\u2019d been planning to perform Mozart\u2019s Requiem and other pieces in the next few weeks, but we couldn\u2019t do that either, which was a real letdown for the choir. You need to earn a crust somehow: you couldn\u2019t do that with an audience of thirty before the new measures, and you certainly can\u2019t now.\u201d", "The social aspect of singing is very important to the members of Toonkunst Rotterdam. \u201cWe love one another,\u201d says one member after the digital rehearsal. \u201cSeeing people makes you feel good.\u201d The ties between them have strengthened during the pandemic: the different voice groups already had their own choir-related chat groups, and there\u2019s now a separate one simply for sharing life\u2019s joys and sorrows. Van Nieukerken has also encouraged the singers to talk on the phone, and one says: \u201cI\u2019m now in contact with people I\u2019d normally never have talked to.\u201d", "Pinning their hopes on the spring", "The choir members are full of praise for their conductor, describing her as a tireless bundle of energy who puts her heart and soul into digital rehearsals. It says a lot that there are over a hundred singers, and not one has thrown in the towel, even with no concerts scheduled. One recalls how a performance of Bach\u2019s St Matthew Passion was cancelled last spring: \u201cIt was a real body blow for everyone, but right at the moment the concert had been scheduled to begin, she messaged us a recording of her playing a French suite by Bach. That\u2019s typical Maria.\u201d", "There\u2019s no telling how and when the choir will start performing again, though they hope it may be in the spring. During the rehearsal, Van Nieukerken announces that the programming committee has put together a contemplative concert including Mozart\u2019s Missa brevis, Unicornis captivatur by the Norwegian composer Ola Gjeilo, and some spirituals. They will make a start on this in the next few weeks. \u201cThat way, we can do a concert as soon as possible after we get the green light,\u201d she says. If the forest of raised thumbs from the choir is anything to go by, they can\u2019t wait.", "Rehearsals always end with a \u201csing your own song\u201d session. The first performer, Ren\u00e9, has chosen a poem by Mikhail Lermontov set to music, which he sings unaccompanied and in Russian, complete with dramatic gestures. When he\u2019s finished, all the people in the little boxes applaud enthusiastically, switching on their microphones one by one and showering him with compliments. Van Nieukerken joins in with the plaudits, and thanks everyone for taking part. \u201cNow go and treat yourselves to a glass of wine or a beer,\u201d she urges them."], "authors": ["Patrick Meershoek En Marloes De Moor"], "keywords": ["sing", "van", "afloat", "rotterdam", "singing", "pandemic", "rehearsal", "digital", "toonkunst", "nieukerken", "choir", "cant"], "pubDate": "2020-11-24T09:42:05Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
