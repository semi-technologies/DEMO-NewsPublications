Such a verdict might surprise readers who watched as Donald Trump took Florida in a surprising upset early on November 3rd, and then coasted to easy victories in Ohio and Iowa. But as early and absentee votes were counted the next day in the country\u2019s northern battlegrounds\u2014Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania\u2014it became evident that Mr Trump would not have enough strength in rural areas to overcome Democratic support in the cities and suburbs.", "On the morning of election day, The Economist\u2019s election-forecasting model gave Joe Biden a 19-in-20 chance of winning an electoral-college majority. Over the course of November 4th Mr Biden amassed 253 electoral votes, according to Decision Desk HQ, our results provider\u2014though Fox News and the Associated Press have also called Arizona and its 11 electoral votes for the former vice-president. All told, Mr Biden is leading Mr Trump in states that account for 270 electoral votes\u2014the threshold required to win\u2014and may pick up another 20 votes in Pennsylvania, where a mass of mail-in ballots in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are waiting to be counted. Our live election model, which accounts for returns in key states, puts his odds of victory at 97% if the call in Arizona is included, and 90% if it is not.", "However, the president has done much better than the polls expected. Current returns indicate that Mr Biden will win the vote in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, for example, even though polls before election day had him leading by roughly eight points. The model had similarly large misses in Ohio, Iowa and Florida. Mr Biden is still expected to win around 270, 290 or 306 electoral votes. That would be at the bottom end of the range of outcomes in our model, but still just about within the \u201cfat\u201d part of the distribution\u2014the portion of outcomes that happen roughly one out of every three or four forecasts.", "The reason for this is straightforward: once again polls have misfired, and only in one direction (no states showing a big polling lead for Mr Trump were in fact won by Mr Biden). The point of using models, as opposed to just polls, is to measure how robust a polling lead is to polling errors that are shared across states\u2014what modellers call \u201ccorrelated errors\u201d. And contrary to the information that public polls could provide, The Economist\u2019s model found that Mr Biden was ahead by so much in so many places that it was hard to envisage his losing in them all.", "However some of the outstanding results could make our model look badly wrong. If Mr Trump comes back with a surprise win in Arizona or Nevada, and Mr Biden does not counter with a win in Pennsylvania or Georgia, then our model will have been way out. Our estimates of the range of possible magnitudes and of the correlations of errors between states would not have been large enough. And even if Mr Biden wins with only the narrowest of margins, that would be right at the edge of what we thought was plausible.", "The Economist\u2019s congressional election forecasts have fared worse. Mr Trump\u2019s overperformance among Hispanic voters foiled our predictions in places like Texas\u2019s 23rd district. One potential culprit is that the model relied heavily on fundraising data, which showed Democrats\u2019 coffers filling faster than their opponents\u2019, which did not seem to be nearly as good an indicator of success this year. And because of the miss in national polls, the model also overrated Democrats nearly everywhere else. Although the Democrats did hold the House, they may well fall below to the bottom end of our uncertainty interval for their total number of seats. The results of the Senate races are certainly within the confidence intervals for our models, but could also approach the very bottom.", "These errors reflect an overall weakness of quantitative models. Our statisticians extrapolate historical patterns into the future and explore the possible errors in our assumptions. When we say that a given candidate has a 60% chance of winning, what we really mean is that 60% of past candidates in a similar position have gone on to win.", "As for the polling errors themselves, we will not have a firm answer about what happened there for a few days. Pollsters will need time to crunch their numbers and work out their mistakes. One potential source of error is that fighting the last war is usually a mistake; polling errors do not usually follow the same patterns from year to year. But in this case, it seems that even though pollsters did try to correct their last mistakes, they failed, The polls over- and under-estimated Mr Biden and Hillary Clinton in the same states, and often by similar magnitudes.", "For pollsters, one particularly worrying possibility is that their surveys did not accurately predict the share of working-class whites who supported Mr Trump. The Economist\u2019s polling with YouGov suggested a shift towards Mr Biden among this group, and returns indicate that counties with higher concentrations of whites without degrees have actually swung further towards Mr Trump. Our polls generally contained a reasonable representation of that group. This suggests that the working-class whites who did respond to pollsters were less likely to support Mr Trump than those who did not respond\u2014a problem that pollsters cannot fix simply by adjusting the weighting of this demographic group. Although there is no evidence that they lie to pollsters about whom they vote for, Mr Trump supporters may very well be too shy to talk to pollsters in the first place. If true, that will be a tough problem for the industry to solve.", "Dig deeper:", "For the latest on the election, see our results page, read the best of our 2020 campaign coverage and then sign up for Checks and Balance, our weekly newsletter and podcast on American politics."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["trump", "pollsters", "overestimated", "mr", "polling", "states", "model", "support", "polls", "errors", "joe", "biden", "votes"], "pubDate": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
