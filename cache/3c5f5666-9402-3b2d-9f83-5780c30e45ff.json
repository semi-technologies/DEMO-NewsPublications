It\u2019s an informative read, but one thing that stands out is that a handful of the publisher\u2019s PlayStation 4 catalog, including several Assassin\u2019s Creed games, won\u2019t be playable on PlayStation 5.", "While all Ubisoft Xbox One games will be backwards compatible on Xbox Series X/S, the same won't be true for the following PlayStation 4 games on Playstation 5:", "Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate", "Assassin\u2019s Creed Chronicles Trilogy Pack", "Assassin\u2019s Creed Chronicles India", "Assassin\u2019s Creed Chronicles China", "Assassin\u2019s Creed Chronicles Russia", "Risk", "Space Junkies", "Star Trek Bridge Crew", "Werewolves Within", "The post doesn\u2019t explain why these specific titles won\u2019t work on PlayStation 5. Syndicate is perhaps the strangest entry, as it\u2019s the only mainline AC game to get left behind (the Chronicles games are side-scrolling spin-offs, for those unaware). Entries that came before, such as Black Flag, and entries that came after, like Odyssey, have seemingly made the cut. That\u2019s a shame given Syndicate is one of the best installments in the series. Again, this only applies to the PlayStation versions of these games. If you own Syndicate on Xbox One, for example, you can play it on Series X/S.", "On the plus side, Ubisoft also announced cross-platform saves for games like Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, Immortals Fenix Rising, and Riders Republic.
