This wasn\u2019t a release date, it was the announcement of Cyberpunk 2077 (but back then it was just called Cyberpunk). I just threw this in here for perspective. Cyberpunk 2077 has had a very long development. Technically 2077 didn't enter full preproduction until after the release of the Witcher III's Blood and Wine expansion, but the point still stands. A lot can happen over the course of eight years. Now sit and think about all the time you've wasted in that time. Now, quickly think about something else so you don't spiral into a self-defeating depression. Need a distraction? How about another release date!", "April 16, 2020", "Official Ranking: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606", "This was Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s first official release date. Honestly, it\u2019s probably one of the best release dates that Cyberpunk ever had. All of the days in April are pretty great because they're not too hot and not too cold. Also, this month is home to April Fools\u2019 Day, which is one of the most underrated holidays. However, it turns out that the real fools were the ones who thought that Cyberpunk was coming out in April. What a bunch of rubes! Instead, we got to spend more time with Resident Evil 3, which came out on April 3. Honestly, I think we all kind of knew that we weren\u2019t going to be playing Cyberpunk this month.", "September 17, 2020", "Official Ranking: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606", "This was Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s second release date. I\u2019ve always said that September 17 is easily one of the top three days in September. The fall colors are starting to bloom, and the pumpkin-spice lattes are finally ready for harvesting. Boy, what else can I say about this day? Ummm, well we got to play the 1.0 release of Hades on September 17, so that was a nice consolation prize \u2026 You know, maybe this wasn\u2019t a good idea for a list.

What a total garbage day. Personally, I think it\u2019s too close to Thanksgiving, and no one should ever release a game on this day. Of course, that\u2019s not really what makes this a bad day. Naturally, when everyone always thinks about November 19, 1954, they think about when the U.S. installed the first automatic toll collection machine in Union Toll Plaza on New Jersey's Garden State Parkway. Talk about gross. November 19 is also World Toilet Day and International Men\u2019s Day. Do you think that\u2019s just a coincidence? Strangely, November 19 was also the release date for the Nintendo Wii back in 2006 (not sure how they got away with that one). I don\u2019t really think this needs to be said, but November 19 is a total crap day to release a game like Cyberpunk 2077. It's just a turd on the calendar.

I know that some of you were hoping for a few more delays, but we\u2019ll have to be happy with the ones we have and the memories we made along the way. Of course, the real reason that CD Projekt Red finally settled on December 10 as the final release for Cyberpunk 2077 probably has a lot to do with the fact that it also happens to be celebrity chef Bobby Flay\u2019s 56th birthday.
