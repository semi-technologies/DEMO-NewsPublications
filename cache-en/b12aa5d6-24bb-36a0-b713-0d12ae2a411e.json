Six years later and on its fourth generation, Amazon has now broken the mould with a new spherical shape and directional audio.", "The new Echo is a ball with a flat bottom to stop it rolling around. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian", "The plastic and mesh fabric ball has one woofer and two tweeter speakers producing directional, stereo sound \u2013 and is designed to sit in the corner of a room rather than the centre of it. It is an unusual-looking object and bigger than you might think.", "There\u2019s a power and 3.5mm analogue audio socket in the back, but the Echo also has Bluetooth. The light ring \u2013 which shows when it is listening to you, the volume level and alerts\u2013 sits at the bottom of the speaker, making it look like it glows.", "The top has four physical buttons: volume up and down, an action button for triggering or silencing Alexa and the mute button for turning off the microphones. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian", "Specifications", "Dimensions: 144 x 144 x 133mm", "Weight: 970g", "Connectivity: wifi ac, ZigBee, Bluetooth, 3x mics", "Controls: top-mounted volume, action and mic mute", "Speakers: 76.2mm woofer plus two 20mm tweeters", "Audio upgrade", "The new Echo is directional with the sound firing forward out of the mesh at the front, rather than 360-degrees as with the previous versions. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian", "The larger, rounder body and new speakers have had a large impact on the audio quality. The new Echo produces far more powerful and deeper bass that you can feel as well as hear, but still manages well-balanced mids and highs. It uses the mics to fine-tune the audio to your room too, similar to high-end speakers.", "It produces room-filling sound that can get very loud indeed, but is just as good when played at 25% volume. It handles most music genres with aplomb with excellent separation of tones, instruments and vocals.", "The baseline in Dr Dre\u2019s Next Episode is punchy and precise while Snoop Dogg\u2019s raspy lyrics come through nice and clear. Eric Clapton\u2019s guitar strums are warm and detailed in the live version of Layla, while Darkside\u2019s Paper Trails sounds sumptuous. The Echo is just as at home blasting out electronica as it with Britpop, and even manages to sound nice and expansive for grand orchestra scores.", "It can\u2019t quite produce the deepest of bass notes, sounding a bit muted in parts of Lindsey Stirling\u2019s Crystallize. Those who aren\u2019t overly keen on bass will have to tweak things in the Alexa app, where you can adjust the levels independently.", "Overall, the Echo is the best-sounding smart speaker under \u00a3100, marking a significant upgrade over previous Echos and beating the recently released Apple HomePod Mini and Google Nest Audio. It isn\u2019t so far off the Sonos One, which costs twice the price.", "Alexa will be faster, eventually", "Setup, settings, alarms, timers, information requests and the equaliser can all be handled from the Alexa app on Android or iOS. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian", "Along with improved sound, the Echo now has Amazon\u2019s new AZ1 Neural Edge processor, which allows some of Alexa\u2019s functions to be recognised and activated without having to rely on Amazon\u2019s servers to interpret. What this means in theory is that requests should be processed much faster and provide greater privacy as only requests requiring data actually leave the device. Google\u2019s latest Nest devices have a similar chip.", "However, the chip is only active in the US and Canada for US English, so I could not test the improvements based in the UK. Amazon said it was working on expanding the languages and regions but did not provide a timescale for rollout in the UK.", "Alexa is a capable voice assistant and is due to receive some significant interaction and intelligence upgrades over the next year, along with new privacy modes \u2013 such as the ability to delete records of every interaction immediately after it has been processed.", "Sustainability", "The speaker is generally repairable. It contains 100% post-consumer recycled fabric, 100% recycled die-cast aluminium and 50% post-consumer recycled plastic. Amazon has also pledged to offset the electricity used by Echo devices with renewable energy. Amazon also offers trade-in and recycling schemes.", "Observations", "The flat base keeps the Echo steady even at maximum volume and has a screw thread for mounting on a stand or tripod. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian", "It has the ZigBee smart home wireless protocol built in for connecting devices such as smart bulbs directly to the Echo rather than through a hub.", "It has a temperature sensor that can be used to trigger routines or activate smart home devices.", "It plays BBC Radio, Tune In, Spotify, Apple Music and Podcasts, Deezer and Amazon Music natively, but does not support YouTube Music or Google Cast.", "The Echo supports Amazon\u2019s Sidewalk networking system, but it isn\u2019t active in the UK.", "Multiple Alexa speakers can be used for multi-room audio.", "Price", "The Echo comes in four colours with an RRP of \u00a389.99 \u2013 although it is frequently discounted.", "For comparison, the smaller Echo Dot has an RRP of \u00a349.99 and the Echo Studio costs \u00a3189.99. Google\u2019s Nest Audio costs \u00a389.99 and Apple\u2019s HomePod Mini costs \u00a399.", "Verdict", "Amazon\u2019s fourth-generation Echo is a significant upgrade in all ways that count.", "Its spherical redesign is interesting and easy to place in the home. It sounds fantastic for the money, supports many of the major music services, including BBC radio, and still works just as well as other Alexa speakers. At some point in the future it will also be faster to respond with greater privacy once the AZ1 chip has been turned on. It now contains a significant amount of recycled materials too.", "Like any smart speaker, you have to trust the manufacturer with your data and privacy. It has an RRP of \u00a390 but is frequently dramatically discounted.", "The Echo is the best-sounding smart speaker you can buy for under \u00a3100.", "Pros: bass you can feel as well as hear, great sound, Spotify, native BBC radio, Alexa, Bluetooth, 3.5mm input, made of recycled materials, interesting design, AZ1 chip. Cons: potential privacy concerns of a smart speaker, Alexa-only, AZ1 chip not active outside US yet, general knowledge not quite as good as Google Assistant, wider footprint compared with cylinder design.", "The mute button electrically disconnects the microphones, emitting a red glow along with the light ring in the base so you can see it from across the room.
