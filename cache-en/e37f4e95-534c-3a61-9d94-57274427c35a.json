Vogue is now on the app with a one-time fashion challenge. Inspired by the Met\u2019s new exhibit, \u201cAbout Time: Fashion and Duration,\u201d we enlisted international editor-at-large Hamish Bowles to show TikTok users how to create a makeshift bustle at home.", "The bustle is a historical garment consisting of a pad or frame worn underneath a skirt, causing it to puff out from behind. Bustles were found in many walking dresses, as they were called, from the early-to-mid 1870s\u2014but we want to see your new 2020 take on the voluminous silhouette. More on that in a minute.", "While Bowles describes how to fashion your own bustle out of household items, his own is of the highest-fashion caliber. For a trip around the Met exhibit, he sports a bustle-style creation from Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s final Haute Couture collection, originally modeled by the designer\u2019s muse, Tanel Bedrossiantz, on the runway. \u201cI felt we had to look for the most sophisticated bustle out there, and this was the perfect thing,\u201d says Bowles of the look. \u201cHis bustle is astounding, and shows what you can do with acres of crin (stiffened horsehair ribbon) and an haute couture atelier!\u201d But you don\u2019t need access to archival couture to make your very own bustle. As Bowles demonstrates, all you need is a pillow, a bedsheet, and a few other key tools\u2014not to mention an abundance of creativity. And now, we want to see your creativity put into action.", "This week, duet our TikTok with the original audio, and create your very own bustle at home using the hashtag #MakeItVogue.
