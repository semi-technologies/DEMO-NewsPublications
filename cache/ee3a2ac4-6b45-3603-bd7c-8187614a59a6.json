For millions of Christians across our nation, this is a bitter pill to swallow.", "President Trump\u2019s strong policies on life and religious liberty would have seemed, from our vantage point, to be a better path for our country\u2019s future. Many of you may be asking: What is God doing in this outcome? Why would He allow this to happen?", "In January 2016 \u2014 a year before Donald Trump was inaugurated as president \u2014 I was flying around Iowa with the then-businessman to campaign with him before the Iowa caucuses.", "BIDEN WINS PRESIDENCY, TRUMP DENIED SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE, FOX NEWS PROJECTS", "We had just finished our elegant lunch of Wendy\u2019s cheeseburgers when I said to him: \u201cMr. Trump, I believe you are going to be the next president of the United States and if that happens it will be because God has a great plan for you and for our nation.\u201d", "\u201cRobert, do you really believe that?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cYes sir, I do,\u201d I replied.", "Donald Trump then asked: \u201cOK, if that\u2019s true then let me ask you a question.

Our faith and our salvation lie not in any human ruler, but in the ruler of rulers, the King of kings. We have to remember that even though the occupant of the White House is changing, the One who occupies the throne of Heaven hasn\u2019t changed.", "The fact that God has established authorities means that by obeying the government, we obey God.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER", "The Apostle Paul told us: \u201cLet every person be subject to the governing authorities.

But the rubber really meets the road when the person who takes office is not the one we supported. Paul didn\u2019t give us any wiggle room \u2014 his command applies all the same, whether the emperor was the faith-friendly Constantine or the evil emperor Nero.", "Here is our chance to show that Christians are not hypocrites.
