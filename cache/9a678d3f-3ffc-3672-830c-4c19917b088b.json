There always are irregularities in every election, particularly when you have 140 million votes cast. It'll be interesting to see, at some point in the next day or so, it's going to become clear who won. And the key at that point is whether or not they're going to be efforts to continue the lawyering. I don't know that it damages democracy. I think it is a sad chapter in the country. We need to count the vote. We need to see who won. Biden has a much clearer, easier path to 270 than than Trump does. But Trump still has one. And one would hope that the loser will call and concede to the winner and we'll move on.\"", "\"One thing that would go a long way would be for the other person not to be filing lawsuits. I'm not taking sides here, whether it's Biden against Trump or Trump against Biden, but that the loser as what used to happen traditionally concedes and and we move on. There will be a lot of people who will never accept whoever the winner is. And that's just a sad fact of life in American politics in 2020.\""], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["winner", "wallace", "loser", "fraud", "accept", "biden", "sad", "need", "going", "won", "point", "chris", "trump"], "pubDate": "2020-11-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
