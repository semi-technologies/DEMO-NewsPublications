I find his criticism to be overly harsh. Corrin nails the young Diana\u2019s graceful movements and shy gaze. The season ends before Prince Charles and Diana\u2019s divorce; it was not until afterward that Diana lost her shyness and became the confident woman whom people remember and admire.", "Aphrodite Moissis", "Athens, Greece", "I agree with Als that \u201cThe Crown\u201d shows how the British Royal Family\u2019s reality is \u201cmore like [ours] than not.\u201d This is most evident in the character of Diana, whose struggle with bulimia and depression holds important lessons. As an eighteen-year-old, I am surrounded by toxic social-media culture, and my peers constantly compare themselves to others.
