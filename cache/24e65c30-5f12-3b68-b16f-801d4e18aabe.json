On September 16th, 24 randomly chosen Germanophones from the country\u2019s eastern fringe took their seats in a Citizens\u2019 Council. They will have the power to tell elected officials which issues matter, and for each such issue to task a Citizens\u2019 Assembly (also chosen at random) with brainstorming ideas on how to solve them. It\u2019s an engaged citizen\u2019s dream come true.", "Belgium\u2019s German-speakers are an often-overlooked minority next to their Francophone and Flemish countrymen. They are few in number\u2014just 76,000 people out of a population of 11m\u2014yet have a distinct identity, shaped by their proximity to Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Thanks to Belgium\u2019s federal system the community is thought to be the smallest region of the EU with its own legislative powers: a parliament of 25 representatives and a government of four decides on policies related to issues including education, sport, training and child benefits.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "This new system takes democracy one step further.

Parliamentarians must consider every proposal that wins support from 80% of the council, and must publicly defend any decision to take a different path.", "Some see the project as a tool that could counter political discontent by involving ordinary folk in decision-making. But for Alexander Miesen, a Belgian senator who initiated the project, the motivation is cosier. \u201cPeople would like to share their ideas, and they also have a lot of experience in their lives which you can import into parliament. It\u2019s a win-win,\u201d he says.", "Selecting decision-makers by lottery is unusual these days, but not unknown: Ireland randomly selected the members of the Citizens\u2019 Assembly that succeeded in breaking the deadlock on abortion laws. Referendums are a common way of settling important matters in several countries. But in Eupen, the largest town in the German-speaking region, citizens themselves will come up with the topics and policies which parliamentarians then review, rather than expressing consent to ideas proposed by politicians.
