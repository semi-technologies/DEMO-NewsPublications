Turnout may well be higher than in any election in the past century. More young people are voting, more people of color are voting, and more people are voting early and by mail. The tallying, too, stands a chance of setting records: in how long it takes for the ballots to be counted, in how widely the results diverge from pre\u00eblection predictions, and\u2014if the vote is close\u2014in how fiercely the results are contested in the courts, in the states, in Congress, and in the streets.", "Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "All this uncertainty has been driving people to horse-race the polls. Liberals, it seems, pay more attention to polls than conservatives do, and some research suggests that, in 2016, pre\u00eblection polls helped deliver the White House to Donald Trump. Four years ago this month, much of the press published not only national polls (which Hillary Clinton led with forty-six per cent of the vote) but also forecasts of the probability of victory (\u201cHillary Clinton has an 85% chance to win,\u201d the Times announced on Election Day). This may have led some people, confusing the two, to conclude that Clinton was projected to win eighty-five per cent of the vote. Quite possibly, a number of them, given the seeming inevitability, decided not to vote.", "This year, responsible news outlets have been more cautious, but they\u2019re also trying to undo an expectation that their own industry has set: that the winner will be known on Election Night. Newspaper publishers and TV producers have taken pains to explain to their audiences that getting the results might take longer, much longer, this time, and reporters have been warned not to head off for vacation on November 4th. The most prudent outlets, including the Washington Post, have agreed not to make any predictions\u2014an about-face, since, as Ira Chinoy, of the University of Maryland, has detailed, the press has been predicting the results of Presidential elections for nearly two centuries.", "Election predictions are mathematical projections that use polls, early returns, and past election results. Americans across the country voted on the same day for the first time in 1848. That was also the first election reported by the newly formed Associated Press, a \u201cwire service,\u201d made possible by the telegraph, which, as a Wisconsin newspaper put it, promised to relieve the public of \u201cthat long suspense which formerly followed elections.\u201d A Massachusetts newspaper urged readers to cut out and keep the returns, because they\u2019d come in handy in 1852, for those who wanted to make their own projections. In 1860, the New York Tribune sold a \u201cPolitical Text Book,\u201d containing all the returns back to 1824, and many papers printed \u201cscore sheets,\u201d something like baseball scorebooks, which readers could use to figure out who was winning.", "In cities, Election Night was like New Year\u2019s Eve: crowds gathered outside newspaper offices, where you could learn the results the fastest. In 1896, the Tribune announced the winner, William McKinley, by flashing red lights from its building. (Green would have signalled a victory for William Jennings Bryan.) In St. Paul, you only needed to open your window, because the Dispatch had arranged for a steamship whistle to blow a \u201cSuccession of Sharp, Short Toots If Returns Favor McKinley. A Long, Dismal Wail If Returns Favor Bryan.\u201d In 1916, William Randolph Hearst\u2019s New York American broadcast the results by wireless, boasting, \u201cThus, through the clouds, was hurled the news of the night.\u201d At 11 P.M., the paper called the election for Charles Evans Hughes; by morning, it had become clear that Woodrow Wilson had won. That same year, the Boston Globe, which pioneered the method of relying on \u201ckey precincts\u201d to forecast a national result, offered an accurate projection.", "In the race to be the first to call an election, CBS found a Polish mathematical savant, Salo Finkelstein, who could make predictions faster than any adding machine. He made his radio d\u00e9but in 1932, in the contest between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover. In 1952, CBS television news engaged the services of a \u201cgiant electronic brain,\u201d the UNIVAC computer. That Election Night saw an unexpected outcome: Dwight D. Eisenhower beat Adlai Stevenson in a landslide. On the air, UNIVAC didn\u2019t make that prediction until near midnight. \u201cTo me the most impressive thing about tonight is again the demonstration that the people of this country are sovereign, that they are unpredictable,\u201d Edward R. Murrow said. But UNIVAC had made the right call early on; CBS had just been too shocked to broadcast it.", "In truth, mathematical modelling based on key precincts in swing states, or what used to be called \u201cthe doubtful states,\u201d had made projections so reliable that, in 1955, Isaac Asimov published a short story about a future in which a very fast computer, the Multivac, selects a representative American to decide the election for the whole country. No one else votes. That dystopia has not come to pass. In 2000, however, the Bush v. Gore debacle made clear that projecting a winner is not the same as counting ballots. \u201cWe don\u2019t just have egg on our face,\u201d NBC\u2019s Tom Brokaw said the day after the election. \u201cWe have an omelette.\u201d Early in the evening, NBC, followed by virtually every other network, had called Florida for Gore and then, later that night, called it for Bush, when all along it had been too close to call.", "The networks\u2019 projections in 2000 relied, in part, on exit polling, which was often flawed and has become an anachronism: it doesn\u2019t work when so many people vote early, or by mail. The A.P., in the aftermath of the 2016 election, launched a painstakingly scrupulous program called VoteCast, which combines real-time national surveys with data and modelling derived from past elections. The problem is that there has never been an election like this one.", "On November 3rd, if there\u2019s a landslide for Joe Biden, that could be clear as early as eleven o\u2019clock on the East Coast. But, if the vote is close, a \u201cred mirage\u201d could show Trump winning, a lead that might be swept away by a \u201cblue shift.\u201d Democrats are three times as likely as Republicans to vote by mail. Ten states don\u2019t even begin counting mail-in ballots until Election Day, and eighteen others accept them afterward, as long as they\u2019re properly postmarked. Counting the actual votes might take weeks, Republicans may try to stop it, and Trump could declare an illegitimate victory. Twitter and Facebook have pledged to add warning labels to any such claim, which is a little like sticking a warning label on a land mine, just before burying it. Meanwhile, there are two things to do: vote, and wait. \u2666", "Read More About the 2020 Election"], "authors": ["Jill Lepore", "Jill Lepor"], "keywords": ["results", "projections", "polls", "trouble", "called", "states", "early", "night", "returns", "election", "vote"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
