The Chopin-playing Dutch intellectual, then 31, had written a book denouncing the EU . Two years later he co-founded a party, Forum For Democracy ( FVD ), which won the largest vote-share in provincial elections in 2019. In a speech that night Mr Baudet described it as a world-historical turning point, invoking Hegel\u2019s \u201cowl of Minerva\u201d, a symbol of wisdom that \u201cspreads its wings only [at] dusk\u201d.", "This month the FVD blew itself up in a series of scandals, and music again played a role. At a dinner on November 20th a newly recruited politician wanted to play 1980s disco. Mr Baudet insisted on classical. Soon, says an FVD senator who later quit the party, Mr Baudet was ranting that covid-19 was a plot by George Soros. He answered worries about anti-Semitism in the party by saying that \u201calmost everyone I know is anti-Semitic.\u201d (He later repudiated these statements, but did not explain what he had meant.)", "The next day a newspaper published chats full of racist and anti-Semitic vitriol among FVD \u2019s youth wing, run by Mr Baudet\u2019s ally, Freek Jansen. Rather than fire Mr Jansen, Mr Baudet quit as parliamentary leader. But he stayed on as an MP , and said he would return as leader if members asked. The FVD \u2019s provincial and city office-holders began deserting the party. So did its other MP and most of its senators, including Paul Cliteur, a legal philosopher whose department at the University of Leiden served as FVD \u2019s intellectual breeding ground.", "As recently as March polls gave FVD about 11% of the vote. But as Mr Baudet flirted with covid-19 conspiracy nutjobbery, its support slid to around 3%. Many who once thought Mr Baudet merely provocative now see him as a dangerous crank. Henk Otten, a senator and one of the party\u2019s co-founders, was pushed out last year after warning that Mr Baudet was being radicalised. He says he has turned into a \u201cfascist psychopath\u201d."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["populist", "chopin", "block", "baudet", "mr", "later", "fvd", "s", "blows", "provincial", "senator", "created", "quit", "prodigy", "newspaper", "thierry", "party"], "pubDate": "2020-12-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
