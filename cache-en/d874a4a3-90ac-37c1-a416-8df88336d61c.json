How has your content evolved on TikTok?", "At first, it was just something to keep my mind creative during lockdown\u2014I mean, there wasn\u2019t much else I could do stuck inside with loads of clothes!

The process normally starts with a video I\u2019ve filmed, and then I\u2019ll try and match the music to it depending on what the mood is. Then I\u2019ll go back and edit the film to sync with the music, and then I may add effects."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["music", "ive", "evolved", "think", "obsessed", "models", "im", "wanted", "walk", "runway", "process", "ill", "depending", "tiktok"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
