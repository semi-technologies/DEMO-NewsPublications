When a gaggle of preteens, some of them only 11, confronted Senator Feinstein in her San Francisco office in March, her curt dismissal of them as non-negotiating na\u00effs went viral, proving that not taking the youth climate movement seriously is a grave mistake. \u201cSunrise\u2019s youth has opened up space and places where no other demographic could get in,\u201d says Rhiana Gunn-Wright of the think tank New Consensus and the policy architect behind the Green New Deal.

Last June, no media outlet would respond to Sunrise\u2019s press releases; this week, The New York Times sends a five-person video crew to the boot camp to film an episode of The Weekly, the TV show inspired by the popular podcast The Daily, and Politico sends a reporter and photographer for a major feature.", "Victoria Fernandez, 26, a cofounder wearing lilac color-blocked Outdoor Voices leggings, a battered copy of 2016\u2019s grassroots manual Rules for Revolutionaries: How Big Organizing Can Change Everything lolling out of her backpack, leads a training session. \u201cIt was only once Cardi B got haters that you knew she was famous,\u201d Fernandez says, noting that Fox News devoted three times as much coverage to the Green New Deal as CNN and MSNBC combined.
