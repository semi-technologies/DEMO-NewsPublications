As expected, both sides agreed to continue talking \u2013 but they agreed that the gaps between their positions remain wide.", "Can we read anything into the language of their statements?", "Unlike the previous two meetings, there was no joint statement following the leaders\u2019 summit. Some have concluded this is a reflection of the depth of division at the dinner table.", "A statement from a Downing Street source was the more pessimistic of the two, stating \u201cvery large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged\u201d. Von der Leyen stated more positively that \u201cwe gained a clear understanding of each other\u2019s positions\u201d but added \u201cthey remain far apart\u201d.", "How does this compare with previous Brexit summits?", "The statements are conspicuously different from after last year\u2019s breakthrough meeting in the Wirral between Johnson and Leo Varadkar. The then taoiseach revealed they had found a \u201cpathway to a possible Brexit deal\u201d, and days later a deal was sealed. By comparison, the optics of Wednesday night\u2019s outcome were not good.", "Does this mean all hope of a deal is dashed?", "No. Both sides have said talks will continue until Sunday and Downing Street said the prime minister was resolved to try to get a deal, saying: \u201cThe PM does not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested.\u201d", "Is Sunday a firm deadline?", "The Brexit trade talks have been punctuated by at least four formal deadlines laid down by either the EU or the UK. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, recently said \u201cnever say never\u201d \u2013 and indicated that talks could go right up to 31 December, the legal end of the transition period.", "Raab told Sky News on Thursday that Sunday will be a \u201cpoint of finality\u201d, but this could be a hardening of language to ratchet up pressure on the EU to compromise. Some believe the language in the dual statements could be part of a choreographed set-up for a victory to be declared by Johnson.", "While the mood in Brussels has been downbeat, according to the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, sources in the EU have been saying in the past few weeks that Brussels would be comfortable with assisting Johnson to deliver what can be painted as a victory to the British public \u2013 or more notably his hard Brexit backbenchers \u2013 if that is what it takes to seal a deal.", "What happens if there is a deal?", "Any deal must be approved by EU member states, the European parliament and the British parliament.", "Trade deals should be allowed 21 days\u2019 scrutiny in parliament, under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. But there is not enough time for that unless MPs were to sit every day including Christmas Day until New Year\u2019s Eve.", "Instead, the prime minister is expected to fast-track legislation for the deal and, provided he gets the support of Labour in the form of a vote of support or abstention, the law will sail through.", "On the EU side, the European parliament has agreed to sit in a special session on 28 December, but many of the 730 MPs may protest that they do not have time to examine a 700-page document to make an informed decision about their voting preference.", "In this scenario, the European council of member state leaders can approve that the deal can be provisionally implemented on 1 January, arguing exceptional circumstances.", "What about no-deal planning?", "The government has dusted down no-deal contingency plans that had two outings last year \u2013 one in preparation for a crash-out on 29 March 2019, and another in October when it appeared that Johnson, as the new Conservative party leader, was prepared to walk out with no deal.", "The plans involved putting the army on standby to deal with any problems getting food and medical supplies through ports, and also potential civil unrest.", "Planes should be allowed to keep flying and lorries to keep moving in the event of no deal after the European commission set out its contingency plans on Thursday, which would allow aviation and road transport to continue as now for six months from 1 January \u2013 as long as the UK government agrees to maintain a \u201clevel playing field\u201d in standards."], "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "keywords": ["brexit", "quick", "negotiations", "talks", "european", "deal", "johnson", "parliament", "guide", "remain", "plans", "sides", "eu"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
