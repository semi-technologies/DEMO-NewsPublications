Schiros is an assistant professor at FIT and a research scientist at Columbia University who focuses on biofabrication, or growing textiles in labs. As part of the One X One incubator program, an initiative by Swarovski and Slow Factory with support from the United Nations, she\u2019s been working with Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne of Public School to grow a zero-waste, low-carbon-footprint version of a Public School shoe out of fermented bacteria. When the pandemic hit the States, Schiros moved her operation from the lab to her basement. The actual growing takes place there, while the tanning and dyeing process can be done in her backyard. If she makes a mistake, she can just toss it into her garden. \u201cIt\u2019s that non-toxic,\u201d she says.", "Launched in February, the One X One program has paired designers with innovators to model sustainable practices in real time and propose low-impact, people-first solutions. Mara Hoffman partnered with Custom Collaborative founder Ngozi Okaro to develop advanced worker training programs for marginalized communities that focus on renewing garments. Phillip Lim worked with industrial designer Charlotte McCurdy to create sequins out of algae, resulting in a gorgeous green dress that challenges our ideas about \u201cnatural fibers.\u201d In short, they are fashionable science experiments. Today, One X One released a documentary showcasing all three projects over the course of the year."], "authors": ["Sarah Spellings", "Sarah Spelling"], "keywords": ["sequins", "worked", "working", "phillip", "lab", "lim", "schiros", "school", "public", "sneakers", "worker", "incubator", "x", "growing", "program", "zerowaste"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
