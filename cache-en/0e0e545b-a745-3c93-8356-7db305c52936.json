Machines are more powerful than the human brain at analysing data and gain insights about the business. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have applications across various industries and different functional areas. The primary objective of ML is to assist in decision making. Today ML is used for driving innovation and as competitive strategy by several organizations.", "Decision making and problem solving has become complex due to competition and scale of operations of firms. The theory of bounded rationality proposed by Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon is evermore significant today with increasing complexity of the business problems; limited ability of human mind to analyze alternative solutions and the limited time available for decision making. Introduction of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems has ensured availability of data in many organizations; however, traditional ERP systems lacked data analysis capabilities that can assist the management in decision making. Machine learning algorithms are a set of techniques and heuristics that can be used to analyse data to improve business performance through fact-based decision-making. In the recent past, automation and innovation across several industries has been driven by machine learning algorithms."], "authors": [], "keywords": ["ml", "decision", "used", "making", "learning", "algorithms", "human", "data", "business", "applications", "machine"], "pubDate": "2021-02-22T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
