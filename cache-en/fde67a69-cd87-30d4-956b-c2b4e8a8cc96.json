When I praised it to my mother\u2014she taught high-school English and was a reader\u2014she said that she hadn\u2019t liked it, that it was a horrible, sad story. I disregarded her opinion, as I did with a lot of what my parents told me. I kept rereading the book, and eventually moved on to all of Nabokov\u2019s other works in English that I could find. Nabokov mentioned landmarks of importance to him in his memoir, \u201cSpeak, Memory,\u201d and I sometimes went to visit them. Travelling in Russia, I looked up the town house where his family had lived in St. Petersburg. It\u2019s now a museum, and I\u2019ve been to it three or four times.", "As an unformed kid, I envied his self-assurance and Olympian disdain. I tried to imitate the style, dropping into conversations half-cribbed Nabokov-like phrases (\u201cI scorn the philistine postcoital cigarette\u201d). Once I happened upon a slim volume of his in the New York Public Library which no one I\u2019ve met has heard of. It contained a line that I treasured like a rare archeological find. Published in 1947, the book is a short anthology of verse by three Russian poets\u2014Pushkin, Lermontov, and Tyutchev\u2014with Nabokov\u2019s translations, accompanied by introductions in which he explains each poet to an American audience. In the introduction to Pushkin, he describes the poet\u2019s end, when he received a fatal wound in a duel with the French ballroom rou\u00e9 Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d\u2019Anth\u00e8s, the alleged lover of his wife. About the later career of this pomaded zero who killed Russia\u2019s greatest poet, Nabokov adds that d\u2019Anth\u00e8s went back to France, got elected to some office or other, \u201cand lived to the incredible and unnecessary age of 90.\u201d", "Childhood is a darkened, fantasy-filled theatre in which, after a long or short while, the houselights are turned on, and the brightness makes you blink, and then you see the candy wrappers under the seats and the lines for the bathrooms. That moment can happen at any time. For me the lights in the Nabokov theatre\u2014a glorious, twinkling venue\u2014got turned fully on when I was in my thirties, during what was for me the waning end of our modern long version of childhood. Afterward I understood better what my mother had meant about \u201cLolita.\u201d", "We lived in Ohio, the centrifugal state, where it seemed that if you let go of the front-door knob for just a second the next thing you knew you\u2019d be flung a thousand miles down the highway. Our house, in a rural development in the town of Hudson, had a gravel drive, which led to a gravel street, to a barely paved road, to Interstate Highway 80, and to New York in one direction and San Francisco in the other. Or to Florida or Arizona or Canada or Alaska or anywhere else\u2014the full three hundred and sixty degrees.", "\u201cI mean, he does have a point.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Becky Barnicoat", "Across the street, past the Gellatlys\u2019 house, and past their back yard, was the house of my friend Don. He and I read \u201cLolita\u201d at about the same time. Just as Humbert pleaded his love for Lolita before the \u201cwinged gentlemen of the jury,\u201d we expounded to each other on our love for various beautiful girls at Hudson High School. These girls were like Lolita, with their field-hockey sticks, and book bags, and scuffed knees on the school bus. Lolita starred in a famous, best-selling book by a high-class foreign author. Therefore, the girls who rode Bus 8 with us were themselves worthy of the loftiest regard\u2014worthy of having love poems written to them, or of being painted by the old-time Italian painters whose names we didn\u2019t remember from trips to the Cleveland Museum of Art. Suddenly it was artistic to be these girls, and to be us, in love with them. The world seemed all in a sweat over this fictional girl, Lolita, who looked and talked and acted like girls we got to be next to, and hopelessly far from, every day.", "As if there weren\u2019t enough roads waiting to take us away, more kept being built, making obsolete certain previous roads, which then had \u201cold\u201d added to their names. Thus there soon were Route 8 and Old Route 8, Route 14 and Old Route 14. Businesses on the old roads languished, but on Old Route 14, which was near where we lived, a place called the Hilltop Motel hung on for a long while. We knew the family that ran it, whom I\u2019ll call the Carluccis. Tony, their son, was in my grade in school. I liked him and, when I was younger, I sometimes went to his house to play. The family lived in rooms on the second floor of a building whose first floor was the motel\u2019s restaurant, where Tony and I sat on shiny red stools at the counter and ordered hamburgers. Then we went upstairs and played with his electric-football set while adults at a table in the next room drank and talked. Once, Tony pointed out a man in the group and told me that he had just got out of prison. The Hilltop\u2019s accommodations were small cabins, which my parents took an ironical view of, for reasons I did not at first understand.", "Tony had a younger sister, Rosa, who was as rosaceous as all girls and women of that name deserve to be. She had long, dark hair and dark eyes, and at an early age she grew into the kind of plum-tinted look so admired by the old-time painters of her ancestresses. Once, I was riding my bike and I saw her and her friend Barb leaning on the railing of a bridge over Interstate 80, known to us as the Ohio Turnpike, and watching the traffic. That such beauty could be found on a tarry two-lane road among farm fields in Ohio proved that God was everywhere. Or\u2014maybe better\u2014that art could be anywhere, even in our unartistic (as compared with Europe) U.S.A. Oh, winged gentlemen, and my mom, of the jury! Mr. Nabokov, the defendant, gave that gift to us Americans, to me.", "I was too shy to say anything to these visions, Rosa and Barb. Did they give me a mocking look as I pedalled by? If they were challenging me to step into Ohio\u2019s centrifugal jet stream, jump the wire fence, stand on the turnpike\u2019s apron, stick out my thumb, and disappear down the highway like the light diminishing to a dot in the middle of a nineteen-sixties TV screen\u2014well, I did do that, not very many years afterward. But even when I was in my early teens, and weak with love for Rosa (and Barb), I had already been all over western North America as a passenger in the family station wagon, along with my mom and two brothers and two sisters, driven by my Ohio-flung dad.", "Like most places, Ohio used to have worse winters than it does now. My mother\u2019s mother suffered from lung trouble, and, when my grandfather retired after forty-two years of teaching in the Cleveland public schools, the doctors recommended that he remove his wife from Ohio\u2019s winters to a warmer and drier climate. He chose Tucson, Arizona. This decision was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I was three years old when my grandparents bought a house in a development recently laid out among the cacti of the Sonoran Desert, a short drive from Tucson\u2019s main drag. Give my dad a target such as the one presented by my grandparents\u2019 four-bedroom ranch-style home and he could not be stopped. He let Ohio fling him at it like a dart, trailing all of us behind. We drove to Arizona to visit my grandparents every year, sometimes twice a year, throughout the nineteen-fifties and into the sixties, until they died. After that, we kept making long western journeys\u2014to Los Angeles, San Francisco, the Yukon Territory, or Tok Junction, Alaska, and beyond\u2014almost like annual migrations.", "Nabokov worked on \u201cLolita\u201d in the early fifties, during summers off from teaching at Cornell, while he and his wife, V\u00e9ra, were driving around the country hunting butterflies. In an afterword to a later edition of the book, he said that one of the towns where he wrote it was Portal, Arizona. To get to that place from Ithaca, New York, he very likely would have driven part of the way on the all-time-greatest American touring road, Route 66. If you were going from the Northeast to the Southwest, you probably took Route 66. The pleasures of this road were so many that books, entire careers, have been devoted to remembering and recording them, now that 66 has itself become an \u201cold\u201d road, superseded by Interstate 44, a characterless four-lane.", "In my work as a freelance writer pursuing one story or another around the West, I sometimes come upon an unchanged stretch of \u201cold\u201d 66, and I\u2019ll see something I remember from my childhood, and the tiny neural address that held the memory of the place in my brain will still be there, in good condition, though unvisited for sixty years. Outside Flagstaff, or maybe closer to Winslow, Arizona, while I was doing research for a piece about meteorites, I meandered off the four-lane onto an undisturbed span of old Route 66, and there was the giant concrete tepee at the gas station where we must have stopped dozens of times. As a kid, I loved that tepee, with its smooth, cool concrete floor and its racks of postcards. Another time, not long ago in Oklahoma, out of the corner of my eye I saw the motel with the Western theme\u2014wagon wheels, oxen yokes, branding irons\u2014where my family had stayed years before. My dad liked to drive straight through, night and day, but two thousand miles from Hudson to Tucson in one go was a haul even for him. The motels where we stopped offered sweet oases of pressed sheets and varnished knotty-pine walls and cigarette-smoke-scented furnishings, an interesting change from sleeping on a mattress on the station wagon\u2019s folded-down back seats, all five of us siblings jumbled together. The cigarette smell also signified not-home\u2014neither of my parents smoked\u2014and recalled the Hilltop Motel\u2019s nostalgic, heady hints of sin.", "We didn\u2019t know, nor did Nabokov, that we happened to be living in the golden age of motels. By the time I was out and driving on my own, most of the old motels had disappeared, replaced by the now familiar chains that try to be identical everywhere. In no work of literature are the wonders of the vanished Motel Age preserved and celebrated better than in \u201cLolita.\u201d Motels and hotels and lodges dance by like a colorful all-American chorus line in the novel, while recurring road trips move the plot. After Lolita\u2019s mother, whom Humbert has married to get to the daughter, is run over by a car and killed, he takes the girl on a long cross-country ramble, from one motel to the next:", "We came to know\u2014nous conn\u00fbmes, to use a Flaubertian intonation\u2014the stone cottages under enormous Chateaubriandesque trees, the brick unit, the stucco court, on what the Tour Book of the Automobile Association describes as \u201cshaded\u201d or \u201cspacious\u201d or \u201clandscaped\u201d grounds. The log kind, finished in knotty pine, reminded Lo, by its golden-brown glaze, of fried-chicken bones. We held in contempt the plain whitewashed Kabins, with their faint sewerish smell.", "Ventriloquizing Humbert, the author goes on to list the places they stayed, and their attractions and proprietors and clienteles, for two more pages. The only other person to chronicle the Motel Age so well was the artist Saul Steinberg, whom I was lucky enough to know for twenty-odd years before his death, in 1999, and who gave me a drawing, \u201cParadise Cabins\u201d [see illustration], which closely resembles the Hilltop Motel, home of the nacreous Rosa.", "\u201cJust because the election is over doesn\u2019t mean we have to stop predicting its outcome.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by William Haefeli", "\u201cHome of the nacreous Rosa\u201d is not something I would normally write, but when the subject is Nabokov I take on a voice I think of as his, although of course it\u2019s not, nor is it mine, but a nowhere hybrid voice, like a clumsy Russian hacking of an American Web site. Nabokov and Steinberg were friends, and Saul once told me that he gave up smoking while visiting the Nabokovs in Montreux. He just quit, with no program or nicotine chewing gum or anything, and never touched a cigarette again. He was a decisive guy.", "Hearing Saul talk about his road trips all over America, such as the one in which he and his wife, the artist Hedda Sterne, drove a Cadillac they had bought from Igor Stravinsky from New York to Los Angeles, I understood that they and my family could well have crossed paths. The same is true of us and the Nabokovs. Vladimir and V\u00e9ra sometimes went West as soon as classes at Cornell ended for the summer. Our family often headed for Tucson when I got out of school in June. The Nabokovs would have been unable to avoid Route 66, and my family always took it, regarding it as our grandparents\u2019 very long driveway. In theory, we and the Nabokovs could have been on that road simultaneously. So it\u2019s not impossible, either, that when we stopped at the Wagon Wheel Motel (or wherever) on 66 the foreign-looking professor and his elegant wife were in a room nearby. If they saw my dad and mom and their five baby-boomer offspring piling out of our blue Ford station wagon and boisterously occupying the adjoining room, did they admire us blond, frowsy-headed children, as my parents thought everybody did? Or not?", "In an afterword to a 1970 edition of \u201cLolita,\u201d Nabokov referred to a place called Gray Star as \u201cthe capital town of the book.\u201d After Humbert is out of her life, Lolita, by then married and pregnant but still in her teens, moves to Gray Star with her husband, Dick Schiller. Gray Star is in Alaska, as the larger context makes clear. \u201cLolita\u201d purports to be a manuscript written in prison by an accused criminal, Humbert Humbert, who is using this made-up name instead of his real one so as not to bring disgrace on anybody with a connection to the story, especially his beloved Lolita. Through his lawyer, the manuscript has come into the possession of an editor and psychologist, John Ray, Jr., Ph.D. The book\u2019s subtitle, \u201cThe Confessions of a White Widowed Male,\u201d supplied by Humbert, makes it sound like a case study, perfect for Dr. Ray, who writes a brief forward explaining the provenance. Ray tells us of Humbert\u2019s and Lolita\u2019s ends. Humbert had expected to die soon, and his wish was that the book not be published until Lolita was also dead. He had hoped that she would outlive him by many years. Dr. Ray informs us that Humbert died of coronary thrombosis in prison in mid-November of 1952, shortly after finishing his manuscript, and that Mrs. Richard Schiller died in childbirth in Gray Star on Christmas Day of the same year. Per Humbert\u2019s wishes as conveyed to his lawyer, Dr. Ray is therefore publishing the manuscript.", "Is Gray Star the book\u2019s \u201ccapital town\u201d because Lolita\u2014along with her baby, a stillborn girl\u2014died there? Had Lolita lived a normal span of years, the book would not have come out, following its own logic, until our present century, and maybe would not exist even today; Lolita, born in 1935, would have been eighty-five in 2020. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the real reason that Nabokov made such a significant-sounding statement about Gray Star.", "The first real-life piece of Russia that I ever saw was Sputnik, crossing the sky over Ohio one night in 1957. The second was when I went on a cruise to the Canary Islands with my family in 1973. The trip came about because one of us siblings had died. My brother Fritz, six years younger than me, died of leukemia when he was a sophomore in high school. The next year, at Christmastime, the spacious country we used to ramble was too small to hold my bereft dad and his sad family, so he took us all on a package cruise. We drove to J.F.K. airport, left the car, flew to Spain, got on a ship, and docked one night on Tenerife, in the Canaries. I came on deck and saw, anchored nearby, a huge, dark ship with a name in Cyrillic letters on its prow. I asked my dad what they said, and from his tour-book familiarity with the alphabet he sounded out \u201cMikhail Lermontov\u201d; below the name was the hammer and sickle. The Lermontov projected the aura of a death star combined with a ghost ship, looming above and aloof from the other ships in the harbor. When we got home, I bought a paperback translation of Lermontov\u2019s \u201cA Hero of Our Time\u201d and read it. I admired how cool, dashing, and romantic Lermontov was.", "The name Gray Star and the memory of that ship are somehow near to each other in my mind. To me the name reads as Soviet, like the big gray letters, the brutalistic \u201cL\u201d resembling an \u201cA\u201d without a crossbar, on the Lermontov\u2019s towering black bow. Gray Star could be the red star of the U.S.S.R. drained to grayness by the cold of the north. The name speaks of almost unreachable remoteness, and of Polaris, visible to both the Russians and to us, and of gray, beeping Sputnik going by. The novel\u2019s \u201ccapital town\u201d is situated in our only state that shares a border with Russia. And, as recently as Nabokov\u2019s grandparents\u2019 lifetimes, Alyaska was a koloniya\u2014a colony\u2014of Russia. The place where Lolita dies is almost in Russia, and almost not in America.", "The site of Lolita\u2019s mournful exit points toward Russia without mentioning it. On the surface, Nabokov does not come off as a Russian writer in the book. The text does not refer to many works of Russian literature, and he told an interviewer that he intentionally kept all touches of Russianness out of the portrait of Humbert, whose background he made Swiss, Austrian, French, and English, \u201cwith a dash of the Danube.\u201d Maybe something in Nabokov drew his thoughts Russia-ward despite himself as he devised Lolita\u2019s fate. I don\u2019t know if he ever went to Alaska, but he can\u2019t have been thinking of (for example) the town of Nome as a model for Gray Star. I stopped in Nome a number of times in my midlife project of going to Siberia by travelling west, continuing my own extension of my family\u2019s chronic westering. From Nome I flew to such Russian destinations as Chukotka, across the Bering Strait, and because I generally had to wait for tolerable flying weather I spent a lot of time in Nome. The town consists mostly of frozen mud, quonset huts, and heaps of rusted, twisted metal. Other Alaskan towns I\u2019ve seen look basically the same. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I admire the feistiness of these towns. But for Lolita to wind up in such a place when she was seventeen years old and pregnant, and then for her to die in childbirth\u2014what kind of medical facilities would they have had in any Gray Star in 1952?\u2014made for a tough finish to an already ruined life. I do not believe that any real place could have been the inspiration for Nabokov\u2019s Gray Star. We have to imagine the town as more of an abstract notion.", "The last time Humbert sees Lolita, she is still in the Lower Forty-eight, living in an unspecified non-coastal state that, judging by the amount of time it takes for him to drive to it from the New York area, could be Ohio. He is in pursuit of the even bigger pervert than himself who stole Lolita from him, and he finds his beloved in shabby surroundings. When he arrives, Dick, the husband, who\u2019s partly deaf because of a war injury, is working on some repair project out in back of their house with a friend, another vet, who has only one arm. The friend injures his hand, they come inside, and Lolita bandages the cut. Humbert observes, \u201cHer ambiguous, brown and pale beauty excited the cripple.\u201d"], "authors": ["Ian Frazier", "Ian Frazie"], "keywords": ["book", "old", "steinberg", "humbert", "route", "nabokov", "town", "lolita", "family", "gray", "star"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
