CEO Riccardo Bellini welcomed her in a statement this morning.", "Hearst is the first non-European to hold this post (Natacha Ramsay-Levi\u2019s exit was announced last week). Her craft-forward aesthetic meshes with Chlo\u00e9\u2019s, but what likely sealed the deal for Hearst was her sustainability bona fides. Last month in an interview with WWD, Bellini indicated that Chlo\u00e9 was seeking B Corporation certification for its social and environmental performance and creating an advisory board to hold the company accountable. \u201cWhat a brand stands for, its beliefs and values, will become as relevant as products and aesthetics,\u201d he said. For many brands sustainability has become a talking point, but Hearst\u2019s appointment cements Chlo\u00e9 as one of the most environmentally minded luxury goods companies in the world.", "Hearst\u2019s first runway show for fall 2017 was produced to have as low as an environmental impact as possible, and from there her commitment to the issue has only grown. Now, she sources deadstock materials, opts for eco-friendly fabrics like linen and cuts out more damaging ones such as cotton, and chooses to use recycled yarns whenever she can.", "Sanna Marin, the Prime Minister of Finland, wearing a dress by Gabriela Hearst.

In fact, most customers would be hard pressed to tell the difference. Hearst\u2019s savvy was in communicating around the subject and becoming a thought leader on the issue. Environmental awareness is her brand\u2019s point of difference. It won her a minority investment from LVMH\u2019s venture arm early last year, and in September of this year, she picked up the CFDA\u2019s Womenswear Designer prize.", "\u201cI am grateful for an opportunity at such a beloved brand as Chlo\u00e9,\u201d Hearst said in a statement. \u201cI am thankful to Natacha Ramsay-Levi and all the other extraordinary designers that have come before her and helped build on the purposeful vision of Gaby Aghion. I am excited for the opportunity to work under the leadership of Riccardo Bellini and support him in his commitment to create a business that is socially conscious and in balance with our environment.\u201d", "Hearst will continue to design the Gabriela Hearst line and plans to split her time between New York and Paris, the pandemic notwithstanding.
