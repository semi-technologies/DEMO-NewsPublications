This would not be worthy of note, but for the fact that the 40-year-old Canadian film-maker, son of horror pioneer David, made his directorial debut in 2012 with Antiviral, about a clinic that harvests diseases from celebrities. For the right price, patients can be infected with Hollywood herpes, or catch the exact strain of flu that caused their favourite singer to cancel a tour. So whose cold is he wearing? \u201cNothing so interesting,\u201d says Cronenberg through a bunged-up nose. \u201cIt\u2019s just sinus trouble. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be disgusting.\u201d", "It\u2019s a bit late for that, as anyone who has seen his films will attest. In Antiviral, restaurants serve steaks cultivated from A-list muscle tissue \u2013 while his new psychological horror, Possessor, features assassins who inhabit people\u2019s bodies via neural implants, then use them as puppets to carry out hits. One such operative, played by Andrea Riseborough, is having difficulty negotiating the work-life balance. Although equipped with a gun, she takes it upon herself to sever her victim\u2019s jugular instead. The stabbing felt \u201cin character\u201d, she says during her debriefing, to which her boss, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, asks: \u201cWhose character?\u201d Decanted into another patsy, Riseborough goes wild, driving a poker into her target\u2019s mouth and breaking his teeth like biscuits, before gouging out an eyeball for good measure.", "Cronenberg wonders if the film\u2019s violence has provoked comment because it was achieved practically rather than with pixels. \u201cCGI violence feels a little floaty and unreal,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have been shocked about the eyeball moment, but there\u2019s an incredibly graphic knife to the eye in John Wick 3. It\u2019s just that the reaction is less strong there because it\u2019s digital. There\u2019s a tactility that\u2019s lost when you abandon practical effects. The needles inserted into scalps in Possessor \u2013 that\u2019s actual hair punched into exquisitely crafted fake heads!\u201d He sounds excitable, like a child showing off his bug collection.", "\u2018We knew we were being watched\u2019 \u2026 Cronenberg. Photograph: Taylor Jewell/Invision/AP", "Riseborough is playing someone who\u2019s playing someone. Is the film partly a disquisition on acting? \u201cThere\u2019s an element of that. Andrea and I talked about which real-world jobs she could draw on, and she said, \u2018Please don\u2019t say acting.\u2019 Well, it kind of is acting. I was also thinking about those drone pilots who have PTSD despite being physically removed from war. But it\u2019s really about the acting we do in our day-to-day lives. We all build these characters. All people are collaborative fictions.\u201d", "He noticed it himself while promoting Antiviral. Answering the same questions for months on end, he became a performative version of his usual self. \u201cIt was the psychological equivalent of seeing your image caught on video by accident. You feel this strange distance. We tend to imagine ourselves as these unified, cohesive wills, but we\u2019re all a chaos of conflicted voices, impulses and ideas. There\u2019s some fascinating science around how our microbiome can influence our behaviour. Not just our own cells but the micro-organisms in our digestive tracts.\u201d It\u2019s schoolboy bug collector time again.", "Watch a trailer for Possessor Warning: violent scenes", "Possessor also touches on corporate and governmental surveillance. \u201cThe Snowden leaks happened while I was writing the film,\u201d says Cronenberg. \u201cWe knew we were being watched, but it was way worse than anyone had imagined. Privacy is a kind of power that can be taken from you.\u201d Not that Cronenberg is claiming the moral high ground. \u201cAs much as I\u2019m coming off like some technophobe hermit, I actually love technology. To be truly secure, you\u2019d have to not exist as a person in the world.\u201d We could always have conducted this interview by mail rather than Zoom. \u201cI should\u2019ve insisted on that,\u201d he says, sounding so delighted that I half expect him to rush out and buy the stamps.", "Asked about his father and the similarities between their films,he visibly slumps, resorting to the stock answers he has given ever since he began granting interviews: he\u2019s too close to his own films to recognise any overlap with his father\u2019s, he says, and all he can do is follow honestly his creative impulses. Yada yada.", "Steaks cultivated from A-list stars \u2026 2012\u2019s Antiviral. Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy Stock Photo", "Perhaps he genuinely can\u2019t see that Possessor echoes his father\u2019s gaming thriller eXistenZ (which also starred Leigh), or that Antiviral repeats motifs from Rabid, Shivers and Videodrome, or that their work shares an inquisitive, deadpan sensibility. Given the eight-year gap between his two features, which was caused by financing problems, the Cronenberg name certainly isn\u2019t helping get his movies made.", "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the joke,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI know people who aren\u2019t related to film-makers and they\u2019re making movies every year.\u201d Did he ever consider directing under another name? \u201cBriefly. But we live in an era where you can\u2019t hide that sort of thing.\u201d At least the more films he makes, the fewer questions he\u2019ll be asked about his father. \u201cI wonder. Denise Crosby, whose grandfather was Bing, once said, \u2018They\u2019ll always ask.\u2019\u201d", "Why not join forces with Sofia Coppola, Jason Reitman and Jennifer Chambers Lynch in a support group for directors who are tired of being quizzed about their film-maker parents? \u201cThat would be a very obnoxious support group,\u201d he says with a wince.
