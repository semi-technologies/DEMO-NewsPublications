Where in Italy? \u201cEverywhere, everywhere. I love it! Last summer, I went to the Tuscan coast and it was so beautiful. Because it's Tuscany, there\u2019re all those rolling hills, but then you're right there on the water.\u201d She reiterates: \u201cI love Italy so much.\u201d", "When she does make it to Italy, Jones will be fully equipped luggage-wise. With her, she\u2019ll bring bags of her own design\u2014items belonging to her second collection for the device-friendly luggage company Away, which launches online today. The line features hard-case rollaboards (one in a glinty metallic copper and one that transitions from black to azul) along with leather tablet cases, weekender duffle bags, packing cubes, and a fanny pack-like accessory to be slung crossbody.", "\u201cAway has never done an ombr\u00e9 before and I really wanted to make that happen. It took some testing, trials, and developing to get the right color combination for it to look good and wear well. I liked the practical meeting the fantastical element of developing something that was first inspired by a thought or a feeling,\u201d Jones explains. The jumping-off point was Jones\u2019s home base of Ojai, California. The village rests at the bottom of a valley in the Topatopa Mountains, where the skies seem to rearrange themselves into a brilliant ombr\u00e9 twice a day at sunrise and sunset.", "\u201cIt has been said that Ojai is a spiritual vortex, whatever that means. But the way I interpret that is the minute you enter the valley, you drop down into some other frequency.
