Smith said that the First Amendment, which protects the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of religion, prohibits only laws that target religion.\nBy letting governments burden religious exercise as long as they impose that same restriction on everyone, it diminishes the promise of the free exercise of religion, in which citizens are allowed to live out the tenets of their faith.\nFortunately, the Supreme Court has the chance to reconsider that rule in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, which it heard on Wednesday.\nDoing so, the agency says, will violate its sincerely held religious beliefs.", "paragraphs": ["Many immigrants came to this land in the hope that they could practice their religion in peace and safety \u2014 and still participate fully in civil society.", "But in 1990, the country took a step back when the Supreme Court in Employment Division v.

City of Philadelphia, which it heard on Wednesday. Catholic Social Services is contesting Philadelphia\u2019s demand that it certify and endorse same-sex couples as foster parents, if it wishes to continue to participate in the foster care system, as it has for over a century.
