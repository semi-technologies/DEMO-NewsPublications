Five years later, Avent-deLeon is broadening her impact with S,T Eat & Stay, a restaurant and boutique hostel. This modern take on a bed-and-breakfast, situated near the corner of Malcolm X Blvd and MacDonough St, occupies three floors of a landmark brownstone. \u201cStaying within Bed-Stuy, building within its infrastructure, and keeping the dollar circulating in this neighborhood has always been a priority,\u201d Avent-deLeon says.", "On the ground floor is Che, a plant-based cafe named after Avent-deLeon\u2019s infant son. By day, the eatery serves grab-and-go items like cold soba noodles, raw cacao mousse, and made-to-order avocado toast with Scotch bonnet lime salt. After 5 p.m., the space flips into full-fledged restaurant, serving a mix of small plates and larger mains like shiso fig salad, crispy tomatillos and tamarind-chile glazed cauliflower tostada, to name a few. Natural wines, beer, and herbal-infused mocktails complement the food.", "The menu, created with chef partner Tara Thomas, pays homage to Avent-deLeon\u2019s Caribbean roots, with a healthy infusion of West African cuisine. \u201cKai is so in love and in touch with her African and her West Indian roots, which are expressed through her grandmother and mother,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cShe really wanted to integrate as that as the root of the restaurant.\u201d Recently relocated from Portland, Oregon, Thomas had been hosting pop-up dinners around Brooklyn. She and Avent-deLeon met through a mutual friend, quickly bonded over the lack of vegan dining options in the neighborhood, and tested out their culinary chemistry with a vegan Sunday brunch hosted at Sincerely, Tommy. \u201cIt was like, a black woman who does vegan food\u2014this is awesome,\u201d Avent-deLeon says. \u201cWe did a couple of events together, then I was looking for someone to do the food at Che, and it just really worked out.\u201d", "When it came to outfitting the restaurant, Avent-deLeon wanted to create a similar melange of international styles. Che\u2019s minimalist interiors are reminiscent of Sincerely, Tommy, with influences from Avent-deLeon\u2019s many travels. \u201cI really wanted this to feel like my trips to Mexico,\u201d Avent-deLeon says. \u201cI just really liked how they literally incorporate everything from the land into any space they have.\u201d All of the tableware was inspired by Grenada, the Caribbean homeland of Avent-deLeon\u2019s mother and grandmother. The salt holders and water jugs are from West Africa. The vintage dining chairs are from Swiss designer Bruno Rey. And there\u2019s an Italian vase in the shape of a Moorish woman\u2019s head.", "Avent-deLeon designed the striped chairs for the space Photographed by Sirui Ma", "In gathering all of these influences and aesthetics, Avent-deLeon hopes that the vibe at Che will inspire patrons to be more present and attentive during their dining experience and, most importantly, to leave their laptops behind. \u201cI totally want to encourage people to come and hang out. By all means bring a book, enjoy something to drink and have something to eat, but it's definitely a table service space.\u201d", "Similar to the community that\u2019s grown around Sincerely Tommy\u2014the boutique frequently hosts support circles for creative mothers, and Sip and Sketch nights\u2014Avent-deLeon wants to make room for OGs and newbies alike to bond. \u201cI'm hoping that we can host a combination of people from the neighborhood and newcomers and just get that space for everyone.\u201d", "Che and S,T Eat & Stay open September 15th.", "302 Malcolm X Blvd, Brooklyn, New York"], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Deidre Dye", "Sirui M", "Elise Taylor", "Alexandra Macon", "Jenna Rennert", "Marley Marius", "Danielle Naer", "Deidre Dyer", "Steff Yotka"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/first-look-new-vegan-restaurant-bed-stuy-sincerely-tommy", "keywords": ["mind", "bedstuys", "sincerely", "west", "neighborhood", "really", "aventdeleon", "vegan", "restaurant", "aventdeleons", "comes", "space", "tommy", "wanted"], "summary": "Five years later, Avent-deLeon is broadening her impact with S,T Eat & Stay, a restaurant and boutique hostel.\n\u201cShe really wanted to integrate as that as the root of the restaurant.\u201d Recently relocated from Portland, Oregon, Thomas had been hosting pop-up dinners around Brooklyn.\nShe and Avent-deLeon met through a mutual friend, quickly bonded over the lack of vegan dining options in the neighborhood, and tested out their culinary chemistry with a vegan Sunday brunch hosted at Sincerely, Tommy.\nChe\u2019s minimalist interiors are reminiscent of Sincerely, Tommy, with influences from Avent-deLeon\u2019s many travels.\n\u201cI really wanted this to feel like my trips to Mexico,\u201d Avent-deLeon says.", "title": "Bed-Stuy\u2019s New Vegan Restaurant Comes From the Mind Behind Sincerely, Tommy"}
