It\u2019s run by mother/daughter duo and is a great combo of neighbourhood charm and French style. We were desperately worried we\u2019d see it go the way of many businesses during the pandemic but once open air dining was allowed in New York, up popped a lovely street-side set-up, complete with bistro tables and the usual cheery but chic greeting. The menu is classic French, and well constructed: I love the leeks vinaigrette and duck fat potatoes, and they\u2019ve just extended to opening Wednesday and Thursday evenings too with a prix fixe option, including unlimited moules \u2014 what\u2019s not to love? \u2014 Katie Hankinson, brand consultant, New York, NY, US", "Peace and loveliness at MoMA \u00a9 2019 MoMA/Heidi Bohnenkamp The sculpture garden at MoMA: an oasis of calm a minute\u2019s walk from Fifth Avenue.
