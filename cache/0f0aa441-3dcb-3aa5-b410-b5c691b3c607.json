That is forcing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to keep pushing water through its dams and hampering repairs.", "\u201cThe dams are still full, the rivers are above flood stage and it\u2019s already snowing in Montana,\u201d said Mike Crecelius, emergency management director of Fremont County, Iowa, where several of the breaches occurred and the river has remained above flood stage since March. \u201cThere\u2019s never a dull moment.\u201d", "This year\u2019s extended deluge is now expected to tie 2011 for the most precipitation flowing into the Upper Missouri River watershed, federal officials say, raising questions about the overall system\u2019s ability to handle increasingly frequent and large storms.", "The Corps controls six massive dams that opened between 1940 and 1962 and were designed to trap runoff and release it in a controlled manner, preventing sudden and catastrophic floods. Normally, by this time of year, Gavins Point Dam in South Dakota, the southernmost flood-control point, releases water at a relatively leisurely 30,000 to 40,000 cubic feet a second. Right now, with reservoirs still needing to clear water to be ready for next spring, the dam is releasing 80,000 cubic feet a second\u2014and high releases are expected to continue into December.", "\u201cIt\u2019s imperative in my mind that we have all of our flood-storage capacity to manage any flood that may come\u201d next spring, said John Remus, chief of the Missouri River Basin Water Management Division for the Corps. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a very fragile levee system still being repaired.\u201d", "But the high water from the dams and continued rains below them mean many of the breached levees can\u2019t be repaired because that would strand large amounts of water on the wrong side of the levees, said Bret Budd, head of the Corps\u2019s levee restoration team. And water levels aren\u2019t expected to end before cold weather sets in.", "\u201cThe weather hasn\u2019t been cooperating,\u201d said Mr. Budd, who came out of semiretirement to lead the project. \u201cIf we get an early winter with early snow and it freezes, we\u2019re done.\u201d", "A dredge pulls sand from the Missouri River bottom to shore up a breached levee near Percival, Iowa.

The first breach, known as an inlet breach, needs to be stopped as soon as possible, but the other breaches, known as outlet breaches, must wait until the river level falls to a point where all the water has drained away. About 14 outlet breaches remain unrepaired, with large amounts of water still covering farms and homes.", "The Corps has temporarily patched 13 inlet breaches to stop water coming into the floodplain, with one more expected to be patched next month.", "SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How should the government manage its dams and levees on the Missouri River to prevent flooding? Join the conversation below.", "It is an epic task as some of the breaches are nearly 1,000 feet long and 60 feet deep.", "Large dredges pump sand from the river bottom into the gaping hole, even as the river continues to flow through the breach. Eventually, the sand forces water out of the opening and the dredges, helped by land-based equipment, continue to pour on sand until they create a berm 500 feet wide at the water level and 100 feet wide above.", "The Corps has spent about $113 million so far on these temporary repairs\u2014with a total cost to restore the system estimated at $1.1 billion over several years, Mr. Budd said.", "Corps officials emphasize that the dams have helped to even out the peaks of flooding this year. They point to a chart showing how much worse flooding would be in a place like Omaha, Neb., if the water had been allowed to flow unregulated.", "But many farmers argue the Corps could do more\u2014like dredging the river or draining more water from the reservoirs in the winter, so there is more room to capture water from spring flooding. The Corps says it has to keep a certain amount of water in the reservoirs for potential drought years, including water for drinking, power production, recreation and wildlife management.", "\u201cThey need to go back to putting people first,\u201d said Kim Ashlock, a teacher from Hamburg, Iowa. A levee that breached on March 16 flooded her home and left a farm that had been in her family for four generations covered for acres in 5 feet of sand. \u201cIt looks like a desert,\u201d she said.", "The spring 2019 outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contained a warning: portions of the Midwest were due for major flooding.
