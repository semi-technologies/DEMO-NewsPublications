Although the jury is still out on that one.", "The marsupials\u2019 bums are made up of four plates fused together and surrounded by cartilage, fat, skin and fur. Alyce Swinbourne, an expert in wombat bottoms from the University of Adelaide, says wombats will use their backside to \u201cplug\u201d up their burrows, stopping predators entering and protecting softer areas of their anatomy.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alyce Swinbourne and southern hairy-nosed wombat Lanie, who is part of the wombat project between Safe Haven at Mount Larcom and the University of Queensland.

When they get in there, they could remove the dead animal, and in the process, squash the skull while moving it out,\u201d she says.", "Swinbourne notes that adult wombats are not necessarily on the menu for foxes, their powerful defence mechanisms making them\u2019 \u201cmore effort than it\u2019s worth\u201d.", "Grotty, also part of the Safe Haven/University of Queensland wombat project.

She will bite them and they will back into her using their rumps,\u201d Swinbourne says.", "\u201cWhen they are playing with other juveniles they will learn to use their bums to back up and kick with their back feet.
