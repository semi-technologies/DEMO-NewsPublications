Perhaps you saw a mutagenic bioweapon unleash a trio of monsters on the city of Chicago in last year\u2019s Rampage. Or you watched as a scientist made a man part-abalone, giving him supermollusk strength and unbreakable skin, in 2016\u2019s Luke Cage. The tool used in both, known as Crispr, has been steadily creeping into mainstream pop culture, injecting new genetic engineering twists into speculative fiction. But the true story of Crispr, while less fantastical, is no less dramatic.", "That\u2019s the takeaway from a trailer released today for Netflix\u2019s new four-part docuseries Unnatural Selection, which promises to take even the most casual viewer inside the revolution that has been brewing in labs, companies, and garages around the world. Using the bacterial quirk that is Crispr, scientists have essentially given anyone with a micropipette and an internet connection the power to manipulate the genetic code of any living thing.", "The teaser zooms in on the stomach-stabbing self-experimentations of biohackers like Josiah Zayner and Aaron Traywick. But the show\u2019s cocreators, Joe Egender and Leeor Kaufman, say DIY Crispr is just one subplot in the larger narrative about what happens when nature can be minutely controlled, when humans might even preside over their own evolution. Their cameras also follow scientists like Jennifer Doudna and Kevin Esvelt and the first patients in an experimental gene therapy trial to treat hereditary blindness. \u201cOur main hope is to create a discussion around these technologies,\u201d says Egender. \u201cPeople might come away excited. Or they might be scared. But at least that means they\u2019re talking and learning and understanding what\u2019s coming.\u201d", "LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Crispr", "Egender and Kaufman aren\u2019t the first filmmakers to tackle the wild possibilities and thorny concerns brought on by Crispr. Earlier this year, a feature-length documentary called Human Nature premiered at SXSW, featuring interviews with the brightest stars and most contentious figures in the Crisprati. Directed by Adam Bolt and coproduced by Dan Rather, Human Nature is being released in theaters in Canada this fall. According to the studio, the film won\u2019t be distributed in the US until sometime in 2020.", "Unnatural Selection ought to bring the existential promise and peril of Crispr gene editing into people\u2019s homes and dinner-table discussions much sooner.
