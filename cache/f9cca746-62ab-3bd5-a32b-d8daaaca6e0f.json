Also back is everyone\u2019s favorite Dark-Side-curious emo-Jedi bad boyfriend, Mr. Kylo Ren, formerly known as Ben Solo and irrefutably embodied by Adam Driver. I will say very little about what any of these people \u2014 or C-3PO, Chewbacca, BB-8 and any new characters or surprises \u2014 actually do for two and a half hours, because the spoiler-sensitive constituency is especially large and vocal.", "Also because they do and say quite a lot. \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d has at least five hours worth of plot, and if that\u2019s your particular fetish, I\u2019m not going to get in the way of your fun. Suffice to say that various items need to be collected from planets with exotic names, and that bad guys cackle and rant on the bridges of massive spaceships while good guys zip around bravely doing the work of resistance. Mysteries are solved. Sacrifices are made. Fights are fought in the air, on the ground and in deep cavernous spaces where \u2026 but that\u2019s enough for now.", "The director is J.J. Abrams, perhaps the most consistent B student in modern popular culture. He has shepherded George Lucas\u2019s mythomaniacal creations in the Disney era, making the old galaxy a more diverse and also a less idiosyncratic place.", "Rian Johnson, who wrote and directed \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d injected some rich color and complicated emotion into the chronicles of domination and rebellion, and also a dash of iconoclastic energy. The bond between Rey and Kylo felt both politically dangerous and sexually provocative, while Rey\u2019s obscure origins suggested that the rebels might finally come to represent something more genuinely democratic than the enlightened wing of the galactic ruling class.", "Abrams, who also directed \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d the first chapter in this trilogy, suppresses that potential, reaffirming the historic \u201cStar Wars\u201d commitment to dynastic bloodlines and messianic mumbo-jumbo, even as he ends on a note of huggy, smiley pseudo-populism. The whole Kylo-Rey thing turns out to involve their grandparents, which is kind of weird, though it could have added a shiver of gothic creepiness to the story. Ridley and Driver are downright valiant in their pursuit of tragic dignity in increasingly preposterous circumstances."]}
