Remember when cats and dogs were receiving ballots, the dead people are receiving ballots. They want all of those ballots to count as well. So it's not about counting every vote. It's counting every legal vote. And in order to do that, we have to have transparency in the counting process. And we also have to make sure that the count is done fairly and accurately. And that's why we are filing the Trump campaign lawsuit to preserve election integrity and make sure that this country is still a country of free and fair elections.", "\"This is not just about going out and making all kinds of legal challenges because, this is about making sure that our process is done according to the law.
