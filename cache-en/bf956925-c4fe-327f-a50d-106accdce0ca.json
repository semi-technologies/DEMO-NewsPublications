Some art stores still had ornate sculptures visible, collecting dust in the dark behind the gates. Others were completely empty, cavernous and blank.", "The calm along the main stretch of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown on a recent afternoon revealed the havoc wreaked by the pandemic on small businesses across America. But the largest and oldest Chinatown in the country has felt the impact even deeper than most, due to the neighborhood\u2019s heavy reliance on tourism and foot traffic for profit.", "\u201cIt\u2019s bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Betty Louie, the adviser to the San Francisco Chinatown Merchants Association. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ghost town.\u201d", "Nine months into the pandemic, a number of the stores are boarded up. Some closed shops have signs announcing they were now open only on weekends; others are shuttered even though their store hours state otherwise. Louie estimates the area has suffered a 85% to 90% drop in business. \u201cThere are places that, I think, are never going to come back,\u201d she said.", "A pedestrian crosses Grant Street behind the Dragon Gate, an entrance to Chinatown in San Francisco.

She visited the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company factory and folded cookies.", "At the time, the factory\u2019s owner, Kevin Chan, thought that racism would be the worst thing to happen to Chinatown\u2019s economy. And then the actual pandemic hit. \u201cIt\u2019s not vibrant any more,\u201d said Chan.", "\u201cYou would go to Chinatown on weekends and there would be all these events, and everybody would be so happy. Now, nobody shows up. Even the restaurants have been hit hard because you don\u2019t let people go in there. They just can\u2019t survive.\u201d", "Nancy Pelosi walks with Florence Fang and Claudine Cheng, right, during a tour of Chinatown, 24 February 2020. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP", "San Francisco was among the first American cities in March to impose a stay-at-home order, hoping that swift and aggressive action would get the spread of the coronavirus under control. The city indeed managed to keep infections low, but the impact on its businesses was immediate.", "The members of the Chinatown Merchants Association did what they could. When restrictions eased to allow outdoor dining and limited in-store service, they fought for shared spaces where part of the street or sidewalk could be blocked off so shops or restaurants could build parklets. They closed streets. They decorated trees. When they couldn\u2019t have their annual Autumn Moon Festival, they held it virtually on Facebook.", "Louie, the Merchants Association adviser, and some volunteers were helping the Far East Cafe build a pagoda-like parklet for outdoor dining when the news broke last week that San Francisco was one of five counties that was enacting a new stay-at-home order amid a surge in coronavirus cases state-wide.", "The California governor, Gavin Newsom, had ordered fresh regional lockdowns for any area where the intensive care unit capacity fell below 15%. The Bay Area region\u2019s was well above 25%, but London Breed, San Francisco\u2019s mayor, said the city had to take the drastic pre-emptive measures \u201cto save lives\u201d.", "San Francisco was among the first American cities to impose a stay-at-home order. Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock", "To Louie and the volunteers that day, the decision was \u201cdevastating\u201d.", "\u201cI still feel like we\u2019re getting over the shock of it all,\u201d Louie said. \u201cWe were all so upset. We\u2019re one of the few cities that can allow more outdoor dining into the winter months. We don\u2019t have snow like the east coast cities. We can survive a little more if they just let us.\u201d", "Adding to their anger, Chinatown has had relatively fewer cases of Covid-19 infection than the rest of the city, given its size. There have only been 102 reported cases in Chinatown, whereas neighborhoods like the Marina, where residents have been chided for the size of their weekend Fort Mason brunch gatherings, has had more than triple that at 376 cases. \u201cWe did our part,\u201d Chan said. \u201cWe wore our masks every day, but people wanted to go to bars and parties. Why do we have to suffer?\u201d", "Chinatown has had relatively fewer cases of Covid-19 infection than the rest of the city.

Sue Lau\u2019s store, Arts of China, was one of them, though she was closing it so she could retire. Her neighbor, however, was not so lucky \u2013 her neighbor had to move to a smaller location because of the downturn in business, Lau said.", "\u201cI feel hurt. I feel bad,\u201d Lau, 73, said. \u201cIn 54 years, I never saw this happen (in Chinatown). It was my first time seeing this in my life.\u201d", "Although it hurts her to see her neighborhood in this way, to a shrewd businesswoman like Lau, it was not unexpected. Chinatown was built by immigrants for immigrants, and while immigrants and their children have always learned to adapt and code-switch to make it in their new worlds, the beauty of Chinatown was that Chinatown could remain the same, she argued. \u201cIn Chinatown, it\u2019s like it was 50 years ago,\u201d Lau said. \u201cFifty years, same thing. Fifty years, no change. And the people, they have no interest in change.\u201d", "A never-changing entity in an ever-changing world is almost reassuring. But from a business perspective, it\u2019s clear what Chinatown will need to do to survive, Louie said.", "San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown has felt the impact of Covid even deeper than most, due to the neighborhood\u2019s heavy reliance on tourism and foot traffic.

But Louie still believes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see once we get past this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the 1906 quake destroyed our community completely. There was not a building left. And here we are more than a century later, and we\u2019re still standing. I do have the hope that we will remain standing, just in a different context.\u201d", "Just before the second shutdown, Louie helped in the installation of another mural of the martial arts legend and San Francisco native Bruce Lee in Chinatown. She said she felt it fitting for the moment.", "\u201cOn that mural, we put up one quote from Bruce that says it all: \u2018Be like water\u2019,\u201d Louie said. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson we take away from this.\u201d"], "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "keywords": ["town", "cases", "covid19", "lau", "pandemic", "ghost", "cities", "francisco", "chinatown", "oldest", "americas", "louie", "san", "photograph", "city", "survive"], "pubDate": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
