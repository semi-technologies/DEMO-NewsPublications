By Rana Mitter. Belknap Press; 336 pages; $27.95 and \u00a322.95", "T HE WAY the second world war is remembered\u2014and used\u2014is always changing. In Britain, the Blitz is invoked in every new crisis. In America, the attack on Pearl Harbour resonated anew after 9/11. Yet, as Rana Mitter of Oxford University shows in \u201cChina\u2019s Good War\u201d, nowhere have successive generations thought more differently about the conflict than in China, where it is seen through the prism of the Japanese invasion that began in 1931.", "In his previous book Mr Mitter chronicled the bloody struggle between Japan and China that erupted into full-scale war in 1937. Now he focuses on the afterlife of those events in films, monuments, parades and propaganda. The Communist Party, he writes, has been striving to convince domestic and global audiences that Japanese atrocities, especially the Nanjing massacre, should rank among the era\u2019s worst abominations. Gallingly for many Chinese, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki often seems to command more sympathy than the suffering inflicted on them.", "This push, Mr Mitter notes, represents a break from the rule of Mao Zedong, when \u201cofficial China spoke in a minor key about the war years\u201d, stressing their role in bringing the party to power. In the past, Nationalist officials and spies, or American soldiers in Korea, were often the villains in Chinese films, as Nazis were in Hollywood productions. Heroic Chinese Communists repelling Japanese marauders always featured as well, but recently the balance has altered. China has been saturated with images of Japanese aggression; the lengths to which movies go to demonise Japanese invaders and heroise Chinese fighters are as striking as their volume. In \u201cDesignation Forever\u201d (2011-), a television series, a Chinese soldier brings down a Japanese plane by throwing a grenade at it.", "These observations are not new, though the range of evidence that Mr Mitter marshals is impressive. The argument he makes about war, memory and the international order is more original. The post-Mao changes, he writes, are part of a broader move from an emphasis on revolutionary ideals and class struggle to one on foreign mistreatment of China during a \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d that began with the Opium wars and peaked in Japanese imperialism. Recent portrayals of the war complement a softening of official hostility towards the Nationalists, whose soldiers and even leader, Chiang Kai-shek, are now given some credit for helping defeat Japan. They fit, too, with a shift from Mao\u2019s dream of prying Tokyo away from Washington\u2019s embrace toward a more combative approach to Japan as a regional rival.", "Finally, and most intriguingly, all this fits with a switch from rejecting the post-war global system, as Mao sometimes did, to using the country\u2019s status among the wartime Allies to forge a \u201cmorally weighted narrative about China\u2019s role in the global order\u201d. President Xi Jinping\u2019s tightening of controls over peripheral territories, and Beijing\u2019s expansion into the South China Sea, can seem imperialistic. But China\u2019s rulers want all that to be interpreted in a radically different light. According to Mr Mitter, China wishes to be seen as incorporating itself into the \u201cexisting, largely liberal order\u201d, while striving to \u201crevise that order to match its own preferences\u201d.", "Joining the World Trade Organisation, hosting the Olympics and becoming more involved in the United Nations all further this aim. So does telling war stories that show Chinese forces contributing to the defeat of the Axis powers\u2014thereby earning China a place at the table at which the post-war order was created. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["second", "mr", "china", "mitter", "japanese", "lest", "legacy", "war", "order", "japan", "global", "chinese", "chinas", "forget", "changing", "world"], "pubDate": "2020-11-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
