Today at his fingertips, however, are 25,000 similarly socially inclined newcomers. They all belong to the Amsterdam Expat Meetup Group, and though the network was founded before Souleyman himself joined, the French-born 36 year old became its chief organizer almost immediately. And soon after, a note appeared alongside the group\u2019s online profile title, reading \u201c(Dutch welcome).\u201d", "Sitting at Caf\u00e9 Thijssen, around the corner from what was his decade-long home in the Jordaan, Souleyman describes his struggles to bring the natives into the network. \u201cDespite my best efforts to attract more Dutch people, I didn\u2019t get much. About 1 per cent of the group is Dutch,\u201d he says, over mint tea and a cheese tosti. \u201cI think Dutch people make friends when they\u2019re little and they stick together. They don\u2019t need new friends.\u201d", "The group\u2019s very few Dutch members are described as having long lived abroad before repatriating. A theory for why \u201cthey want to hang out with other people from everywhere else\u201d is that \u201csomething broke within their friendship group.\u201d He hypothesizes: \u201cYou move abroad, you don\u2019t get that closeness anymore\u201d but once back \u201dnow you need new friends.\u201d", "Proper nerds", "On paper, Souleyman fulfills stereotypical expectations of an expat\u2014a highly educated Westerner with a globally in-demand expertise, recruited for employment abroad and possessing means for real estate in a prime neighborhood, taxis and a robust nightlife. His expertise is P2P, the management process that streamlines an organization\u2019s purchase-to-pay transactions. But in person and in personality, Souleyman hardly comes across as just another suit crunching numbers.", "\u201cI have long dreadlocks. I\u2019m the only black man in the room most of the time,\u201d he giggles, explaining how online acquaintances should easily find him in person. \u201cWho else is gonna be Summer here?\u201d Being recognizable\u2014and extremely conversational\u2014helped him quickly grow the Meetup events, reportedly from, in the early days, 50 people who fit into a bar\u2019s backroom to, at peak popularity, 1,700 at a nightclub.", "He characterizes the Meetup group as mostly single, highly educated Europeans, with \u201ca big chunk\u201d comprising IT, finance and law professionals, followed by \u201cthe babysitters and the gap-years\u201d and occasionally tourists. \u201cAnd some of these guys,\u201d he points out, \u201cespecially the IT types, are quite proper nerds, not social at all. So you really have to make an effort.\u201d", "Everything with expats", "Among the non-singles are people who \u201cmoved here for their Dutch partner,\u201d Souleyman observes, yet the couple\u2019s non-Dutch half often struggles. \u201cThe partners cannot break into that friendship. A lot of them try really hard, but they can\u2019t break into it and eventually they give up, I guess. So they come to us and they hang out with internationals.\u201d", "One story he tells stars a Canadian who moved to the Netherlands for her Dutch boyfriend. Within months, she learned to speak Dutch and spent time with \u201chis whole bunch of friends,\u201d but after a couple years together, she continued to \u201cstill feel like she\u2019s not part of the group\u201d and broke up with him, remembers Souleyman. \u201cThe thing is, she lashed out at the wrong place\u2014they were on the boat. So after you shout at everybody, you just sit there. You cannot walk out!\u201d", "He is unable to contain his laughter, though the tragicomedic anecdote seems to let him work through some of his own misgivings. \u201cI don\u2019t know many Dutch people, to be honest, because I\u2019ve been doing everything with expats,\u201d he says. His own partner is a Czech woman he met on Leidseplein while she was on holiday.", "Expat host", "Souleyman grew up in Metz, France, and attended boarding school in Lome, Togo. The location facilitated travel across West Africa \u201cto see my people,\u201d he says, referring to the Fula, an ethnic group of historically nomadic pastoralists from whom he descends. He then moved to London, where he got a Bachelor\u2019s degree in literature and \u201clanded in finance accidentally.\u201d At 26, he was hired to manage insourcing and stabilization of accounts receivable and billing for Amsterdam-headquartered ICT company Getronics.", "Playing the role of expat host was \u201cfun,\u201d but also \u201cwasn\u2019t good for my health,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a bit crazy. I was out every night, like Monday to Monday because I\u2019d come back from work, I\u2019d have nothing to do,\u201d Souleyman recalls of his first five years in Amsterdam. \u201cI\u2019d just go to the bar and just start drinking. People would text me, asking: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 Expats come back from work, they don\u2019t know people in the city. Everybody knew Summer, so everybody texted me.\u201d", "In 2014, when his career started demanding frequent travel, he brought in other group organizers. While admitting that his nocturnal routine sometimes stole concentration away from what he initially came to Amsterdam for\u2014work\u2014he also acknowledges \u201cactually, it helped me a lot in my job.\u201d To train a multinational company\u2019s staff in new financial systems, such as P2P, Souleyman has to engage individuals who often come from vastly different cultures and work ethics.", "\u201cI was never really comfortable managing the networking and people aspect of it, but after talking to a whole lot of people\u2014like hundreds and hundreds of people every night\u2014I just felt really comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I can walk up to anybody.\u201d The Meetup group also showed him the value of meeting-up, even if it requires going farther than Uber can take him.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to work with people if you don\u2019t meet them,\u201d he explains having realized after a project required him to fly to India. \u201cYou kind of learn to understand the way they understand things. It gives you that perspective that you don\u2019t get when you\u2019re shouting on the phone.\u201d", "At least four babies", "These days Souleyman remains a Meetup group organizer, but as one of five. He attends events \u201conce every six weeks or so,\u201d he estimates, and this summer began work to launch an online English-language news portal called \u201cExpat ID\u201d. Lately, he has also been busy moving. He and his girlfriend, with whom he has been since 2009, recently bought a place in Duivendrecht. But, \u201cI don\u2019t consider anywhere my home,\u201d he emphasizes, attributing the attitude to \u201cthe nomadic part of me, that I think I can settle anywhere.\u201d", "Still, Souleyman holds a shepherd-like status for flocks of new Amsterdammers. To his knowledge, the Meetup group has so far resulted in a couple dozen partnerships and at least four babies, including twins born to a German-British pair.", "\u201cI put them together. I was invited to the wedding,\u201d he says, recalling how upon concluding a night of buying them Sambuca shots, he fetched a bar napkin and a pen just when the German was ready to share her number and the Brit\u2019s phone battery had died. \u201cWe became good friends.\u201d Yet there remains one regret concerning their twins. Laughing, he exclaims: \u201cYou have two\u2014call one after me. After all that I\u2019ve done.\u201d"], "authors": ["Karina Hof", "Floris Vermeulen"], "keywords": ["dont", "work", "meetup", "really", "group", "friends", "need", "souleyman", "dutch", "moved", "summer", "id"], "pubDate": "2019-08-09T10:43:00Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
