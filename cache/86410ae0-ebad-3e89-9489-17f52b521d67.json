Forwards Millie Boyle and Amber Hall dominated the Dragons in the middle, as the Broncos ran almost double the amount of metres as the Saints and had 63 per cent of the ball. Second-rower Annette Brander was named player of the match, after looking damaging on the edge.", "\u201cThe hope is for next year that everyone returns and we just continue this,\u201d Brigginshaw said.", "\u201cWhoever is picked to wear this jersey just buys into it and follows the values. It just goes to show that we have faith and the coaches to pick the right people who pick the club. Whoever the coach picked or the team signed, they just pulled on the jersey and get the job done.\u201d", "Such was Brisbane\u2019s dominance, the Dragons had just nine play-the-balls in Brisbane\u2019s half in the opening 50 minutes of the match.", "Everything that could go wrong did for the Dragons in front of 36,785 people. Star hooker Brittany Breayley missed part of the first half with a knee injury, while youngster Maddison Weatherall was taken to hospital after a bad leg cut. Takiele Katoa also hurt her shoulder in the second half, as did Australian lock Holli Wheeler. The Saints also made errors at the worst times, including a first-half fumble in a scrum after the Broncos had made a push against the feed.", "After Lavinia Gould opened Brisbane\u2019s account in the fourth minute out of dummy-half, McGregor made the most of the scrum error when she stepped over in the next set. Brigginshaw landed the knockout blow after the break, when she put winger Julia Robinson over with a sharp cut-out ball to make it 18-0.", "Forward Chelsea Lenarduzzi and Amber Pilley also blew out the lead with second-half tries, before Kezie Apps scored a late consolation four-pointer for the Dragons. The win means Brisbane have lost just one game in the competition\u2019s two-season history, firmly establishing themselves as the league\u2019s top team."], "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
