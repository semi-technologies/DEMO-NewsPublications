I can\u2019t fix you. I can\u2019t fix anyone. Nobody fixes you but you. That\u2019s why I say, If you\u2019re going around me\u2014to smoke or get high or whatever\u2014you\u2019re not fooling me. I\u2019ll accept you any way you are. The only person you\u2019re fooling is you.\u201d Rivera emphasizes that change happens only hour by hour and day by day\u2014and that, nonetheless, you can wake up one day and find that the hours of work have accumulated into months and then years. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way it happens. You\u2019re always coming home.\u201d", "He has a favorite aphorism about those whom he always calls his \u201cclients,\u201d which on another afternoon he stressed more fiercely than his usually equable tone allows. \u201cThe quote is mine, so I\u2019m gonna own it,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018The crime is not who you are, it\u2019s what you did.\u2019 David said once, to a journalist who asked, \u2018How can you work with these violent criminals?,\u2019 \u2018Well, how would you like to be identified for your entire life by the one worst thing you\u2019ve ever done? If your editor made you put at the top of every column you ever wrote, Written by Tom the Bed-Wetter. Or by Tom, Who Drove Under the Influence.\u2019 I\u2019ve worked in D.C., where people identify themselves by their degrees\u2014\u2018I went to this school\u2019\u2014and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. And sometimes people of color introduce themselves that way\u2014\u2018I was in prison.\u2019 But that\u2019s not you! The crime is what you did. The crime is not who you are.\u201d", "Like anyone who is naturally good at something, Sam Rivera got to be naturally good at his work by thinking constantly about his performance and being acutely aware of what he is doing as he does it.", "\u201cPart of what I have is the contradiction of my appearance,\u201d he explained one evening. \u201cI\u2019m a big man, and I can look intimidating.\u201d He crossed his arms and looked out at an imagined audience. \u201cSo, when I\u2019m there, like this\u201d\u2014he became the man he is in meetings, hands relaxed by his sides, a half smile on his face\u2014\u201cthen I\u2019m sending the message that you can be both, a tough guy who is open and not frightened. \u2018If Sam is like that, then I can be like that.\u2019 It\u2019s about me taking control of what my own experience is. I had a mentor once, and I was telling him everything I was doing, and he said, \u2018Where is Sam in this?\u2019 That was hugely helpful to me. Seeing yourself from outside.\u201d", "Rivera was sitting over dinner at Trufa, an eclectic little restaurant at Broadway and 140th Street. The neighborhood, which had been poverty-stricken, filled with abandoned buildings, and therefore affordable when the Fortune Society salvaged the place, in the late nineteen-nineties, is now, as Columbia University pushes north and west, an ever more desirable area, dotted with restaurants and the inevitable espresso joints. The former convent school would be unaffordable now.", "\u201cThere\u2019s an architecture of the room that I rely on\u2014E. being firm in the corner, Easy kibbitzing from the side,\u201d Rivera went on. What had seemed an accidental weekly arrangement was purposeful. \u201cYou can\u2019t emphasize enough things that may seem superficial. The look of a room, the kind of food we serve, which doesn\u2019t look or taste like institutional food. Remember, a lot of our residents are people who went from eating institutional food in school to eating institutional food in prison and that\u2019s all they know. No one\u2019s ever spoken to them empathetically. No one\u2019s ever asked them how they feel.\u201d", "Rivera grew up on the Lower East Side. \u201cMy mother had me when she was fifteen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we were always working poor. My parents always had jobs.\u201d He speaks with the ancient, \u201cr\u201d-less, broad-vowel speech of a New York working class. In prison, Rivera recalled, he helped care for sick inmates during the height of the AIDS crisis, and he has done the same sort of work ever since. Rivera first visited Fortune as a client, in 1991, and then began a career in various post-prison and advocacy groups, including a long stint at Exponents, a leading drug-rehab organization in New York. Since then, he has been back and forth between Fortune and another nonprofit. \u201cI\u2019m a four-time recidivist here,\u201d he has joked. He lives in Teaneck, New Jersey, and has two teen-age sons and a daughter in her twenties.", "\u201cThat you\u2019ve got to hit the rock-bottom moment?\u201d he said, reflectively. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time. I\u2019ve looked at programs that were created around recovery protocols, and the theory was: If there was ten per cent left of your rock bottom, they would intentionally bring you down to that zero, and then build you back up. My view is just the opposite. If you still have ten per cent after being through prison and abuse of many kinds, then we can start.", "Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Seth Fleishman", "\u201cSo, I tell the story. I was with my boys, watching a show where they\u2019re imploding a casino, and I\u2019m kind of into it. It\u2019s all dramatic, and they hit the thing\u2014old school!\u2014you know, the box with the plunger? And at about the third floor it caved in and the guy said, \u2018Wow! With all the dynamite we used to destroy this building, the foundation was so strong that it wouldn\u2019t go down.\u2019 And I\u2019m, like, \u2018That\u2019s it! \u2019 If we can find your foundation, you won\u2019t fall. You\u2019ll lean! You\u2019ll trip, but you won\u2019t fall. So that\u2019s my work, finding the foundation that remains. Let\u2019s not make it about the dynamite. Let\u2019s work on your foundation\u2014what will keep you standing, even if you start to use drugs again, even if you went back to prison. So that\u2019s the only bottom I want to hit. That foundation that\u2019s still there.\u201d", "David Rothenberg founded the Fortune Society almost by accident. In the late nineteen-sixties, at the peak of his career as an extremely successful Broadway publicist, working with the likes of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, he produced a Canadian play about rape in prison called \u201cFortune and Men\u2019s Eyes,\u201d and realized that the men who were most stirred by the play were ex-cons, as they were called then. Almost as an afterthought, he began a help line for such people\u2014\u201cReally, only an extra desk in the office\u201d\u2014and watched it blossom into a lifetime\u2019s work. Yet he remains spiritually on both sides of the doorway. This makes his conversation a singular braid of show-biz anecdotes and social-activist exhortations. Holding out his right arm, he might say, \u201cThis is the arm that Liz Taylor cried on at the opening night of Dick Burton\u2019s \u2018Hamlet\u2019 in 1964,\u201d and then avow, \u201cThe mistake you make is thinking that they\u2019re ever honest about crime numbers. The city will bring them up and down as they want, according to the politics of the moment.\u201d", "The turning point, for him, took place on \u201cThe David Susskind Show,\u201d in 1968. \u201cEveryone watched Susskind on Sunday nights,\u201d Rothenberg recalled. \u201cThey always had six of a kind\u2014six ex-alcoholics or six prostitutes or whatever was coming in sixes that year. I called the producer and said, \u2018Have you ever had six former prisoners?\u2019 She said, \u2018I want \u2019em but I can\u2019t get \u2019em.\u2019 I said, \u2018I can.\u2019 So we went on, and the next morning, after the show, I got call after call after call. It was overwhelming! There was an endless line of men snaking up the stairs of this theatrical building. And I began to transition from full-time press agent and part-time prison activist to full-time prison activist and part-time press agent. Well, no-time press agent.\u201d", "Rothenberg takes a late lunch or an early dinner most days at Trufa. \u201cThursday meetings are always essential\u2014we realized that if we had rooms and no services we were just a hotel,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Sam does at the meeting is he gets people talking who are comfortable talking, but sometimes he\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey, Joe\u2014what\u2019s happening with you?\u2019 And Joe starts talking and doesn\u2019t shut up. He had never been given permission. Joe\u2019s never been asked how he is in his life!\u201d Rothenberg chuckled.", "\u201cYou know \u2018The Green Pastures,\u2019 the movie?\u201d The 1936 film relates Bible stories as Black American folklore. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a line, I think it\u2019s from there, that I always repeat. The Lord, who\u2019s represented as African-American, says to an angel, \u2018We have to take care of that planet, but don\u2019t forget the wing of the sparrow over there.\u2019 Sam is one of the people taking care of his portion of the planet by taking care of the wings of the sparrow.\u201d", "Housing programs for an offender\u2019s re\u00ebntry into the community usually involve a bewildering array of bureaucracies, and often result in former inmates being placed in halfway houses and homeless shelters that replicate the conditions of prison. Almost three-quarters of the released population are arrested again within three years.", "\u201cThe Castle began when we kept seeing that there was an urgent need for housing for people released who became homeless,\u201d JoAnne Page, the president and C.E.O. of the Fortune Society, explained from her office at the society\u2019s administrative headquarters, in Long Island City. \u201cMore than half the people coming out of state prison to New York City right now are being dumped in shelters. HUD defines people who are coming out of incarceration as not homeless, so no HUD-funded program can take them in. They have to be sleeping under a bridge before they can officially be classed as homeless.\u201d In the late nineteen-nineties, Page came upon the empty Catholic girls\u2019 school. \u201cThe city took it from the nuns and left it vacant, with the idea that it would become a TB hospital, but they gave up on that idea, and instead it became a magnet for drug dealing.\u201d In 1998, Fortune bought it for $1.2 million.", "Page emphasizes the society\u2019s \u201copen doors\u201d policy. \u201cWe\u2019re bound by laws about sexual offenders and proximity to schools,\u201d she said. But applicants are screened for \u201ccurrent risk of violence, not a history of violence. We have some of the people with the worst records in New York City coming for active services, but no metal detectors. We offer people something they really want, and the condition is that they have to behave peaceably if they want it.\u201d", "The Fortune Society holds most of its job-training and vocational-education programs at its Long Island City offices, with the Castle offering its own approach to social services. \u201cIt\u2019s valuable that Sam has lived experience,\u201d Page said. \u201cHe knows prison faces. He can tell the difference between someone who looks tough and someone who\u2019s a threat. And most of the people coming home will see somebody in that room they did time with. That changes everything.\u201d", "The residents of the Castle admired Rivera for being as reliable about small things as he was about big ones. E., the longtime resident with the basso-profundo voice, put it bluntly: \u201cSam is the difference between leadership and leadershit. If you have leadershit, everything\u2019s going to be shit, and that\u2019s the primary reason why the shelters are such hellscapes. Sam watches the simple things that improve the outlook, improve the humanity.\u201d Hilton N. Webb, Jr., another long-term resident, sixtyish and intensely serious, who is studying for a master\u2019s degree in social work, and writing a memoir titled \u201cDancing in the Midst of Nothing,\u201d said, \u201cWhatever Sam says is going to happen, it\u2019s going to happen. I remember when I was having problems with my roommate and I had to move to a single room. Sam said, \u2018You\u2019re going to have the same river view,\u2019 and, to make a long story short, it happened. The river view is a nice view. That it was a little thing didn\u2019t mean he thought it was nothing.\u201d"], "authors": ["Adam Gopnik", "Adam Gopni"], "keywords": ["sam", "makes", "difference", "coming", "work", "getting", "prison", "city", "went", "im", "thats", "fortune", "rivera", "staying"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
