Beeld Marie Wanders", "\u2018WARM\u2019 read the red letters over a metal column from an old FEBO wall mounted in the foyer of FUKU, the nearly year-old cafe in Bos en Lommer. Rather than kaassoufl\u00e9s, however, the trays hold jars of specialty coffee beans, sourced more equitably than most and costing, on average, 11 euros. Inside, the bar is hand-crafted and hand-painted, the main espresso machine is a now-collector\u2019s item designed by Brabander-turned-global-cult coffee figure Kees van der Westen and the seats are vintage pieces by Friso Kramer.", "And yet, says cafe co-owner Dylan Sedgwick, \u201cI find chairs quite uncomfortable now.\u201d", "Antikraak", "Although at his workplace, every item has been thoughtfully curated for optimal utilitarianism and as a nod to local culture, at his home, Sedgwick cannot hang anything on the walls. In Geuzenveld, on the top floor of what he calls \u201cthe worst looking building on Dr. H. Colijnstraat,\u201d the 33-year-old New Zealander and his Dutch girlfriend live antikraak. \u201cAnti-squat,\u201d as the name translates to in English, is a government-sanctioned, agency-controlled system that rents out abandoned edifices for very little money to prevent squatters from moving in.", "\u201cAfter the second place, we got rid of everything. We sit on the floor, and we eat on the floor,\u201d he explains, noting that he and his girlfriend have so far resided in five homes over three years. \u201cWe stopped settling. You can\u2019t make the house yours really, and after a while that\u2019s become a grind for us. That feeling of having a place that you can come home to, that it\u2019s yours \u2013 we don\u2019t have that feeling.\u201d", "Agreeing to live antikraak means not knowing when the agency will serve them two-weeks\u2019 notice to vacate and, when it does, if it will assign another residence. The insecurity is complicated by the success of FUKU and affiliated roastery Friedhats, which Sedgwick co-runs with Lex Wenneker, a celebrity Dutch barista whose international coffee competition trophies are displayed at the cafe.", "Commuting", "Although Sedgwick\u2019s girlfriend, a former professional dancer, now works on contract as a rehearsal director and assists at the coffee roastery, the couple still does not meet Amsterdam\u2019s requisite housing-cost-to-income ratio. Making matters worse is that \u201cshe liked Rotterdam,\u201d where she moved from, while \u201cAmsterdam is a bit tense all the time,\u201d he admits. \u201cI see now that we\u2019re trapped in antikraak. Also, I have a business here, I started my life here, so we\u2019re a bit stuck. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any option to live here really unless we\u2019re lucky somehow.\u201d", "They considered moving to another city and commuting, but it would still \u201cbe a bit tough to get here,\u201d Sedgwick says. One barista lives in The Hague and another in Delft, but when the out-of-towner has opening shift, starting at 7:30, uncertainties arise. \u201cHe gets up early, but if there\u2019s a problem with the train, then we have to come in his place. You need that kind of backup plan, so it\u2019s not really ideal to have that situation as a business owner.\u201d", "But compared to his life before Amsterdam, \u201cit\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Sedgwick assures. Nowadays, he no longer has housemates, something tolerated throughout the five years he lived in London, after leaving Australasia but before moving to the Netherlands in 2015. As a UK passport holder, he found work rather easily in London, but constantly faced \u201ctwo constraints\u201d: transportation (to avoid the Tube, which was slow and expensive, he rode a motorcycle though feels \u201clucky I didn\u2019t die\u201d) and finances.", "\u201cUnless you\u2019ve got old money or are in a nice banking position,\u201d he says, \u201cthere are a lot of people just working to survive there. And that\u2019s basically where I started.\u201d", "A bubble", "London is also where Sedgwick met his first Dutch girlfriend, a fellow coffee professional for whom he moved to Amsterdam. They were together for a couple months and during that time also lived antikraak, at \u201ca nice place in the East, just off the Molukkenstraat.\u201d Today, many of the coffee professionals he knows share apartments, while his customers, most of whom are Dutch, have places of their own. But \u201cwe\u2019re in a bit of a bubble here,\u201d Sedgwick emphasizes, observing that their regulars tend to have \u201csteady incomes\u201d and have already lived in the neighborhood for years.", "Still, \u201cit\u2019s epic,\u201d he says about all the development and construction currently taking place in the city. On a recent trip he and his business partner took to the Amsterdamsche Fijnhouthandel, the old sawmill in the same industrial harbor area as their roastery, Sedgwick was struck by a sign advertising a new apartment block.", "\u201cThe advert of the apartment shows on the street a Jaguar, an old Jaguar, and Lex and I were laughing. We\u2019re like: it\u2019s so funny to put that in this picture. If you can\u2019t afford this retro Jaguar, which is fucking expensive and also needs to be in its own garage, you\u2019re not gonna live here, you know? Don\u2019t even bother looking. Pretty bad,\u201d he says, before adding: \u201cThat\u2019s foreign investment more than expats.\u201d", "Easygoing and unvain, Sedgwick hardly comes across as the clich\u00e9 of a cotemporary cafe owner. When he moved to the Netherlands, he wanted a career change, flirting with applying to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or getting a job in human resources (which his degree is in). But his ex-girlfriend\u2019s friends and, specifically, their favorite cafe hangouts pulled him back into the coffee world.", "\u201cA different route\u201d", "\u201cI moved here and I met Dutch people straightaway, so my social network was almost all Dutch people\u2014apart from my Dutch class,\u201d he says, acknowledging that his was \u201ca different route\u201d from that of other newcomers to the city. \u201cI never really get the expats that come here and don\u2019t kinda integrate. But I can understand also: you come here for work and you work in an office of foreigners, so you just speak English all together.\u201d", "Conversing in Dutch, even if it is what he calls \u201cbad Dutch\u201d, and having his own enterprise provides a semblance of settledness.", "As he puts it: \u201cOnce you see that you created something that runs, it feels like you have something here. And I know a lot of people in the coffee community, so in that sense, I have this kind of comfort of home.\u201d", "That said, \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be moving some time this year, by the looks of things. Some people were moving out this week. It feels like the end is coming,\u201d he says rather flatly. \u201cI have some sort of income, which is enough but not enough to just rent a house here somewhere. So what do we do? Because we\u2019re a bit done with antikraak.\u201d"], "authors": ["Karina Hof", "Floris Vermeulen"], "keywords": ["bit", "antikraak", "looking", "dutch", "moving", "house", "coffee", "sedgwick", "place", "old", "moved", "really", "expats"], "pubDate": "2019-08-16T16:00:00+02:00", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
