On the other side of the door, the cat is staring at me through the glass. It is a hard stare. I know the cat wants to come in so that he can climb on to my desk and walk back and forth across my keyboard, deleting files and pressing Send prematurely. He knows that, if he does this with sufficient persistence, I will eventually feed him, even though I have already fed him. Anything, just to get a little work done. So the door remains shut, and I\u2019m getting a stiff neck from trying not to make eye contact.", "Pets were meant to be the great beneficiaries of the pandemic: with so many people furloughed or working from home, the dogs and cats of Britain would finally receive the attention they craved. And the food. Soon, however, people discovered that home-working and pet-owning were not entirely compatible. Cats don\u2019t care if you are in the middle of a Zoom meeting. Dogs don\u2019t understand deadlines. Some parrots make so much noise during the day that one charity recently reported a 70% annual increase in those needing rehoming. In the spring, the whole awkward arrangement seemed charmingly temporary but, as England locks down for a second time, many pet owners still have not found the right balance between work and the animals they care for \u2013 between cat and keyboard.", "\u201cMany cat owners will find that their pet wants to get involved with what they\u2019re doing, and won\u2019t realise they\u2019re not helping,\u201d says Evy Mays, feline welfare adviser at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. (Note: I\u2019m almost certain my cat knows he\u2019s not helping.) \u201cGiving cats extra enrichment during working hours can help keep them occupied,\u201d she says. She suggests \u201cpuzzle feeders, interactive toys and access to the outdoors to burn off energy and tap into their natural exploratory behaviour\u201d.", "Your laptop \u2026 the purrfect place for a catnap. Photograph: D Jiang/Getty Images", "Cats, however, as many of us have learned, are not always so easily dissuaded. \u201cIf the cat persists in trying to clamber over your keyboard, try training the cat to sit in a designated area on the desk during work hours,\u201d says Mays. She advises placing a small towel in an appropriate area on the desk. Every time the cat jumps up on to the desk, point to the towel using a word such as \u201chere\u201d or \u201ctowel\u201d as a marker. If the cat goes to the towel, give the cat a treat, so it associates the positive action with reward.", "\u201cThis may take time, but it\u2019s a good way to encourage the cat to an appropriate place, while also engaging with them in a positive way to increase mental engagement and stimulation,\u201d says Mays. \u201cNever punish the cat if they do jump on the keyboard or don\u2019t use the towel.\u201d Cats, apparently, have trouble grasping the idea of bad publicity.", "It is the middle of the afternoon, and I have come inside to keep one eye on the television while I work through some emails. This is my idea of multitasking. The dog, meanwhile, is doing this thing \u2013 bouncing between a low crouch and a sitting position, backing up a few steps and repeating \u2013 that roughly translates as: \u201cYou! Me! Right now! Let\u2019s go!\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d I say, which, as far as the dog knows, is true. But the dog\u2019s priorities are not my priorities.", "\u201cA dog who seeks attention even when you\u2019re busy is communicating that, at that moment in time, they need something from you,\u201d says Suzie Douglass, head coach at the Dogs Trust\u2019s Dog school in Dartington. \u201cThey could be seeking attention because they\u2019re worried about something and need reassurance, they might be bored and seeking something to do, or they might simply not understand why you\u2019re sitting there ignoring them when usually you respond.\u201d", "The secret to a happy, work-friendly dog is a predictable routine \u2013 they like structure, so feeding, walking and playing should ideally happen at the same time every day. Work time should also be part of this routine. \u201cEstablishing consistent boundaries between work and free time is beneficial for us as well as our dogs,\u201d says Douglass. \u201cFor those working from home on a longer-term basis, it\u2019s especially important for a dog to learn to relax, lie down and have time on their own when you\u2019re busy on phone calls or video meetings.\u201d", "A toy that makes a dog work for a treat may buy you enough time for an emergency virtual meeting, but marking the boundary between work and play involves teaching your old dog a new trick: how to \u201csettle\u201d. Set aside this training for a time when your dog is already feeling relaxed. Sit quietly on a chair with the dog lying on a blanket on the floor. Drop bite-sized treats as a reward for settling, but do not say anything while you are doing it, and don\u2019t give any attention to non-settling behaviour. Gradually increase the amount of time the dog must settle for before you reward them.", "A noisy bird presents a knottier problem: you can\u2019t silence a parrot, and you should not try to. Some species will naturally squawk or sing at regular intervals during the day, for up to 20 minutes at a stretch. Excessive screaming can be curbed, but you would need to know the cause, and a bird might scream for any number of reasons: illness, loneliness, boredom, tiredness, fear or even jealousy. Otherwise, the basic strategy is the same as it would be for cats and dogs: reward the behaviour you want, ignore the behaviour you don\u2019t like. Foraging toys or \u201cpuzzle feeding\u201d \u2013 anything that makes the bird work to get food \u2013 can also keep your parrot busy, and possibly quiet. If you think your parrot is lonely, you could try getting another one for company, but that sort of doubling down is prone to backfire. You might end up with two screaming birds.", "Perhaps the most important to remember is that your constant presence represents a big disruption for your pets, too, especially if you are allowing the stress of work to invade the domestic sphere. \u201cAnimals rely on reading body language, so can be very good judges of our own emotions, even if we are trying to hide them,\u201d says Nathalie Ingham, a canine behaviourist at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. Cats, you may not be surprised to hear, are a little less sensitive to your career problems. \u201cFor the most part, cats won\u2019t take too much notice of longer working hours unless it impacts on them receiving a valued resource, for example meals,\u201d says Mays. They may, however, be upset by outward behaviour that they are not used to, such as loud exclamations or pacing, so it\u2019s important they have somewhere to go to get away from you.", "I\u2019ll sing if I want to \u2026 noisy birds can play havoc with your concentration. Photograph: Philippe LeJeanvre/Getty Images", "Dogs are more likely to pick up on your stress. \u201cOur dogs can recognise when we\u2019re agitated or worried and this can affect the way they feel, too,\u201d says Douglass. \u201cIt helps to learn to recognise the signs that your dog is beginning to feel uncomfortable about things, as then you can take steps to help them feel better. Dogs can show subtle signs they are becoming worried, which humans often miss, such as licking their lips when they\u2019re not hungry, and yawning when they\u2019re not tired.\u201d Taking some time out to walk or play with your dog will not just reduce his stress levels, but yours.", "For dogs, the real problems may begin when we finally return to the office. \u201cAll the extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs,\u201d says Rachel Casey, the director of canine behaviour and research at Dogs Trust. \u201cIf they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more difficult for them to cope once we eventually go back to our normal lives.\u201d", "It may seem premature at this point, but we should be preparing our pets for the end of working from home. For cats, this may simply be a case of providing an environment in which they can busy themselves during the day in ways that do not involve human social contact. With dogs, it is a matter of maintaining, as much as possible, the remnants of your pre-pandemic routine. \u201cIf you used a dog walker before lockdown, we would recommend that you still get them to sometimes walk with your dog if possible, as this is a big part of some dogs\u2019 routines,\u201d says Ingham.", "Above all, you and your pet will both need some me-time, even when you are at home together. \u201cJust make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them to cope when alone,\u201d says Casey. \u201cThey could be separated from you by a door or child-gate for an hour or two while you\u2019re working.\u201d", "Unfortunately, there is no barrier to stop a cat\u2019s eyes boring into the back of your head while you are trying to work.
