For the over 90% of people worldwide who don\u2019t struggle with some form of eating disorder, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that\u2014after all, food is meant to bring us together and help us commemorate good times, even if we do occasionally overdo it a bit, right?", "But for the 10% of us who identify as disordered eaters, things get a little bit more complicated around the holidays. Every ED sufferer\u2019s story is different, but as a person living with binge eating disorder\u2014an illness that the National Eating Disorders Association describes as being characterized by \u201crecurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food (often very quickly and to the point of discomfort)\u201d\u2014it's hard for me to see the holiday season as anything but a minefield of food-related triggers.", "For years now, my holiday food pattern has looked the same. Sometime before Thanksgiving, I resolve to make this the year that I don't sneak to the fridge for a furtive late-night helping of leftover mashed potatoes after everyone else has gone to bed. But at 2 a.m. on Friday morning, I invariably find myself in the kitchen, gorging past the point of fullness and into a strange, silent, near-meditative state that almost instantly gives way to shame. Sub out the mashed potatoes for my mom's Yorkshire pudding, and Christmas looks much the same; so does New Year's Eve, which my friends usually celebrate with vats of Indian takeout. No matter the occasion, it's always the same; what starts out as a fun, appropriate amount of food-based indulgence turns on a dime, quickly becoming something I have no hope of controlling.", "For better or for worse, this year\u2019s holiday season won't look like any that we've experienced before; the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has public health authorities discouraging holiday travel, and many of the people I know are planning small \u201cpodsgivings\u201d and mini-celebrations with friends instead of full-on family affairs.
