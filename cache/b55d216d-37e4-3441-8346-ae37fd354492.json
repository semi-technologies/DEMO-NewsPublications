As great as it\u2019s been to watch Rain and Rambo tear it up, Mileena\u2019s gameplay might be the most glorious (read: goriest) sight to behold.", "Shang Tsung created Mileena at the behest of Shao Kahn by combining Edenian and Tarkatan DNA. This bittersweet fusion bestows on her the physical grace and near-identical appearance of Kitana as well as the bloodthirst and horrifying visage of Baraka. Mileena last appeared in Mortal Kombat X and...didn\u2019t make it through that game\u2019s story, we\u2019ll say. Thanks to Kronika\u2019s time travel magic, however, the former Kahn gets brought forward to the present day. After learning of her reign and grisly death at the hands of D\u2019Vorah and Kotal Kahn, Mileena's out to reclaim her throne.", "Based on the trailer, it looks like Netherrealm dialed Mileena's viciousness up to about 19. The new twists on her signature sai attacks look great, and they\u2019re bolstered by a Sonic-style spin attack and even Reptile-like invisibility. Her insane and absurdly graphic fatality probably ranks among the game\u2019s bloodiest which says a lot. Mileena looks like a blast to play especially if you\u2019re an enthusiast for throat-ripping and eye-gouging. Those raising their hands should probably keep that to themselves.", "Eager fans will get their hands on Mileena when Kombat Pack 2 and Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate arrive November 17 for current and next-gen consoles as well as Switch and PC. Kombat Pack 2 runs $14.99 while Ultimate, a bundle of the full game, the DLC characters, and the Aftermath expansion, will be $59.99.
