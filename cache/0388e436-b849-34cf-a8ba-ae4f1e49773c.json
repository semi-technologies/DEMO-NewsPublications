Perhaps more impressively, she did so in fewer than half the number of games, 50 to Parris\u2019s 110.", "At the 2019 World Cup, she became the Netherlands\u2019 all-time scorer after two goals against Cameroon, taking her to 60 international goals and overtaking Manon Melis\u2019s tally. Now, she has 70 in 91 games for her country, also dwarfing the 50 in 102 games set by her hero, Robin van Persie, for the men\u2019s team.", "The records, though, are \u201cjust another box ticked\u201d for a No 9 that does not revel in the spotlight that leading the line brings. \u201cObviously for me, as a nine, I know it comes with scoring goals and I know that is my first job,\u201d she says. \u201cWe joked about it a couple of times today, the easiest thing would be to stop scoring goals and then you wouldn\u2019t be in the picture any more, but it\u2019s something you just get used to.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vivianne Miedema celebrates scoring her second and Arsenal\u2019s fourth goal in the thumping win over Tottenham last month.

It feels really good, it feels like I\u2019m achieving what I\u2019ve wanted to achieve and that motivates me to be a better player than I am right now.\u201d", "The microscope zooms in closer with every new achievement and there are gifs of Miedema, memes, goat emojis everywhere and a fascination with a player that just oozes cool. \u201cIt was weird at the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be fair until a year ago I didn\u2019t even know what a GOAT [greatest of all time] meant, I was like: \u2018It\u2019s not really nice for people to call me a goat. It\u2019s not the best animal to be.\u2019", "\u201cAnd then obviously Lisa had to explain what it actually meant.

It\u2019s really good that all players, all club legends, not just at Arsenal, get involved in the game and start following the game. It\u2019s amazing to be a role model in the women\u2019s game right now, I hope his wee granddaughter is going to reach this level and wear the Arsenal colours,\u201d she says in her Scottish/Dutch twang.", "The goals continue to come, and after she scored all four goals in the Continental Cup victory against London City Lionesses last week, Wright tweeted: \u201cWe are lucky to have her.\u201d", "He is right. The way in which the phenomenally efficient forward stalks the pitch, almost nonchalantly, is almost addictive to watch, and the secret is a football obsession. \u201cI\u2019ve just been a football monster from such a young age,\u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019ve watched so much football, I\u2019ve played so much football.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vivianne Miedema dives for a header while playing for the Netherlands against Cameroon the 2019 World Cup in France.

Obviously I\u2019m quite relaxed, if it doesn\u2019t go in I know the next chance will and I think that really helps me to be relaxed and calm in front of the goal.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vivianne Miedema warms up with her partner and teammate Lisa Evans before the Champions League quarter-final against PSG in August.

When you don\u2019t have a lot of time off between seasons your body doesn\u2019t fully recover. Having six months of lockdown we all finally had the chance to work on what we needed to work on. I\u2019ve never enjoyed running, I\u2019ve never enjoyed the gym, even before, but I have enjoyed lockdown.", "\u201cIt was easy for us because it was Lisa and me together and we could play a bit of football, we could run, we went on hikes, we went on walks, it was a bit of a mix but it opened my eyes.\u201d", "Lockdown, then, was a welcome rest. \u201cOh I loved it,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the whole team it came at the right time, obviously a pandemic and lockdown never come at a right time, but for us, the state we were in, it was actually really nice to have the opportunity to switch off. I was in Scotland, in Holland, seeing families from both sides and enjoying different things, it\u2019s my 10th season at the highest level and I\u2019ve not really had any time for myself or for family and to have that for once felt really nice.
