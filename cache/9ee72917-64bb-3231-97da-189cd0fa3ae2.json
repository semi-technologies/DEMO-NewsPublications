While that difference may seem minor, even semantic, it\u2019s one of the great differences in American politics \u2014 and largely explains what we are now living through.", "If you prioritize campaigns, you want a candidate who draws great crowds, gets people excited, and has an attractive policy platform. But if you prioritize elections, you want to build a machine that wins the elections \u2014 the candidate is secondary at best.", "And that\u2019s what Democrats have been doing methodically. While former Vice President Joe Biden was hiding in his basement, Democrats were building a machine to win no matter what, able to adapt to this year\u2019s massive surge in voting by mail.", "TRUMP LAWYER JENNA ELLIS: WINNER OF TRUMP-BIDEN RACE WILL BE DETERMINED BY COURTS \u2014 WE DON\u2019T KNOW YET WHO WON", "And now we are seeing their plan come to fruition. Based on current, uncertified vote totals, every major news organization is projecting that Biden will be the president of the United States in January.", "However, the media don\u2019t decide elections. Votes are still being counted. According to The Associated Press, four states (Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) are within 1 percent. No recounts have started, and challenges (which will ultimately play out) are being ignored.", "This has been astounding to watch.", "Callista and I were at the White House on election night and into early Wednesday morning, and the president was ahead in most of the key battleground states. But then suddenly vote-counting stopped. We couldn\u2019t figure out what was happening.", "And when we got up in the morning, we saw that hundreds of thousands of ballots suddenly appeared, almost all of them for Biden. Now, you can rationalize that development however you want, but at the least it\u2019s suspicious and worthy of further investigation.", "On this week\u2019s episode of my podcast, \u201cNewt\u2019s World,\u201d I discuss why we need to be pushing for further investigation and not give up simply because the elites tell us to be quiet.", "The Democrats and the media are going to say that, even though all the votes haven\u2019t been counted, President Trump owes it to the country to cave, accept defeat, and walk off. Some will also say that we don\u2019t need to do any recounts.", "There are a large number of what I call accommodationist Republicans who always believe it\u2019s their job to side with the Democrats and the news media when things get too tough and when the elites really put the pressure on them. Because after all, their main goal is to be liked and go to nice cocktail parties, not to do right by the country.", "These accommodationist Republicans will say they don\u2019t like the president talking about fraud, vote theft, or corruption. They don\u2019t want to look at the data and the growing evidence that something is clearly amiss in places like Detroit, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.", "And then there are the people around Trump who understand that his presidential run in 2016 was a direct assault on a national establishment, which had betrayed the American people and no longer represents them. This elitist group only represents its own interests and sometimes the interests of foreign countries.", "I suspect that President Trump is going to keep fighting, as he should. We owe it to the American people to have an honest, straightforward election. Every legal vote should be counted. That\u2019s a tall order, but it\u2019s necessary for the sake of our republic \u2014 not to benefit President Trump or anyone else, but to ensure the legitimacy of our sacred democratic process.", "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER", "We at Gingrich 360 have been getting an amazing number of emails from different people telling us about specific instances of people who were intimidated, people who were told they couldn\u2019t be poll watchers, and people who saw fraud. That is why I am urging all of you, the American people, to report instances of voter fraud to the website https://www.gingrich360.com/honestelections/.", "I hope you will listen to this week\u2019s episode, in which I put into context what we\u2019re witnessing after the election and discuss how to proceed from here. The integrity of our elections is in jeopardy, and we need to ensure that our electoral process does not become delegitimized beyond repair.", "Also, brace yourself as the entire national establishment rushes to embrace Biden as president-elect. Some will do so because they want it to be true. Others simply don\u2019t want to pick a fight with a new potential president.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "Meanwhile, Trump supporters will be lectured to forget five years of vicious attacks by Democrats and the liberal media. We will be told to be nice and work together \u2014 while the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and others publicly say they want to purge Trump supporters.", "Don\u2019t be fooled: This is not over.", "To read, hear, and watch more of Newt\u2019s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.", "CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH"], "authors": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"], "keywords": ["youve", "know", "gingrich", "president", "say", "media", "vote", "elections", "despite", "biden", "election", "american", "dont", "won", "told", "trump", "newt", "democrats"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
