Pre-election forecasts appeared initially to have overestimated Joe Biden\u2019s margin of victory by about six percentage points in Florida (which is correct) and by four or five points in other south-eastern states such as Georgia and North Carolina (which is not). The national popular vote was hovering closer to a one- or two-percentage-point margin between the two candidates, rather than the eight-point one expected by The Economist\u2019s election-forecast model, which relies on polling data.", "But in the three days since officials released those initial figures, millions more Democratic-leaning ballots have been counted. They have pushed the results of the election closer to the forecasters\u2019 expectations. Our election model appears to have correctly predicted the outcome in 49 of 50 states and Washington, DC. The initial diagnoses of a doomsday performance for pollsters and modellers have been overblown. Still, the polls performed poorly. Since 2000 our averages of polls over the final two weeks of the campaign have over- or underestimated the Democratic share of the two-party vote in each state by about two percentage points. As of 19:00 EST on November 6th, the average error across states this year will be just shy of three points, or just about 50% worse than in the past. This would be reassuring but for two troubling facts. First, the errors in state polls almost uniformly pointed in the same direction, and to an unprecedented extent. Although the polling errors since 2000 have on average tended to favour neither Democrats nor Republicans, this year they systematically underestimated support for Mr Trump by about 2.8 percentage points. Even more troubling is that the polls seem to have missed support for Mr Trump in the same states where they missed it in 2016, as we wrote in our print edition this week. Although the industry is not as badly off as the naysayers claim, pollsters still face a reckoning in trying to fix these patterns.", "The error in the polls raises two final points. First is the importance of election models, which explore what might happen in an election if the polls err. The Economist\u2019s forecasting model found that Mr Biden was comfortably ahead in so many places that it was very unlikely that he would lose the electoral-college majority. Interpreted that way, our forecast seems to have fared well. Yet the public may not look on forecasts in the same way that modellers do. At the top of our website on election day we showed a 97% chance that Mr Biden would win the election, and a central projection that he would secure 356 electoral-college votes. Although the prediction of his victory is all but certain to be confirmed, the high odds may have misled readers into expecting a landslide win for Mr Biden, and that all other scenarios were off the table. In fact, the model was meant to communicate that winning anything between 259 and 415 votes was plausible, with tallies nearer to the middle of that range more likely. Next time around we will do better to highlight the full range of outcomes in our model. That is, after all, the real point of the exercise.", "Editor\u2019s note: This article first appeared in our weekly \u201cChecks and Balance\u201d newsletter on American politics.
