Instead, they go each evening to sleep in a nearby school building and return home in the morning. The school has been shut since the Covid-19 outbreak, and benches have been moved aside to make room for mattresses, and a makeshift kitchen.", "\u201cThis is our life now,\u201d says William Lenanyekie, 16, after his breakfast of tea with goat\u2019s milk. He walks out of the family enclosure in Resim to take the goats out for grazing, as he\u2019s done every day for the past seven months. Like many of his peers, he has decided not to return to school. \u201cI prefer to stay here, and do something useful.\u201d", "William Lenanyekie is among young herdsmen in Samburu, Kenya, where every 15 years or so an initiation ceremony takes place for a new generation of morans, or warriors", "In March, a few days after announcing its first case of Covid-19, Kenya closed all educational institutions. For the Samburu, semi-nomadic pastoralists, the timing coincided with a special ceremony \u2013 held only once about every 15 years \u2013 that marks a boy\u2019s rite of passage. At the centre of this ceremony is circumcision.", "Once they are morans, the boys are considered responsible for their community\u2019s protection. They can also make their own decisions and get their first taste of freedom.", "Schools across Kenya have begun to restart lessons for pupils sitting exams. But many Samburu teenagers are not expected to return to class when schools fully reopen, reversing years of efforts to get children in the region into school. Since the last ceremony was held, education has played an increasingly important role in the lives of boys and girls in Samburu, where school enrolment was booming.", "\u201cNobody was prepared for what was going to happen,\u201d says Jane Mutua (pictured), head of the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) in Samburu. \u201cEverybody thought we were going to close for maybe a month or two. But now it\u2019s already happening \u2013 education [has gone] out of their minds.\u201d", "The TSC has asked teachers to contact pupils and convince them to come back, but the timing of the initiation ceremony has not helped matters. \u201cWe are bound to lose more students than would have been [the case] if the initiation ceremony had taken place during the school season,\u201d says Mutua.", "Nkaibeli Lesori, head of the school committee in Resim, which opened its first school 15 years ago, says: \u201cMany boys have left. They look after cattle in faraway places. We worry that they have forgotten everything that they\u2019ve been taught in school.\u201d", "Over the past 15 years, school enrolment in Samburu has been increasing", "Not just the curriculum, but also the benefit of education, says Mutua. \u201cIf you go a bit in the interior, there\u2019s nobody to remind these children that education is good for you. This child forgets totally. You find them going back to their traditional ways of doing things and to their traditional beliefs.\u201d", "In contrast to their parents, who are mostly illiterate, the majority of Resim children were in school before lockdown, he says.", "William says his break from school has given him the confidence to live on his own. \u201cI see the virus as an advantage,\u201d he says. Currently, he sees no reason to return to education. \u201cI don\u2019t need to know more than I know now.\u201d", "From left: Gideon Lemeleny, William Lenanyekie and Ben Lerat ride a motorcycle in Samburu", "Ben Learat, 16, disagrees. He is now a moran, and grew up in the same family household as William but he sees school as his ticket out of rural life. \u201cI\u2019ve been here all my life, I really want to leave this area,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to go to university and be a doctor.", "\u201cNow we have to look for grass in faraway places,\u201d he adds, referring to the cattle his father asked him to herd as soon as his school closed.", "The primary school building in Resim has been empty since the coronavirus outbreak. There have been no classes but the school is being used as a makeshift living quarters for young herdsmen", "It\u2019s not just boys who are dropping out, says Nasieku Letipila, the Samburu county director of social services, but girls are too. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have another calamity after this.\u201d", "Why Covid school closures are making girls marry early Read more", "When a new generation of morans is initiated, the previous cohort become young elders, who are then eligible to marry.", "\u201cThis is the time of marriage \u2026 They marry off young girls. It\u2019s common. And most especially, at this particular time, this transition of the morans,\u201d says Letipila. \u201c[Marriage] means no school any more. You cannot be a wife and a student at the same time.\u201d", "Child marriage is illegal in Kenya but Letipila expects many young girls to have been married off in lockdown. \u201cSchool has been a safe place for girls,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody will marry them off when they are in school. But because of the long duration that they are staying at home, we have lost many girls.\u201d", "Nabulu (pictured), 17, who did not want to share her last name, escaped being married off by running away to the nearby town of Wamba. She had fallen pregnant by another student who had offered her food but wanted sex in return. \u201cI fell for his trap,\u201d she says.", "When her father learned of the pregnancy, he wanted her to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) and get married. \u201cWhen I refused, he started beating me and my mum,\u201d says Nabulu, who now lives in hiding with her mother.", "\u201cMost pregnant girls will not go back to school,\u201d says Letipila. \u201cThey will start doing odd jobs, just to sustain themselves and to feed the child.\u201d", "In Resim, teachers expect that out of 110 pupils, 20 will drop out. The TSC anticipates that more will drop out in Samburu. \u201cIf we can salvage three-quarters of every class, I think we\u2019ll have gone a long way,\u201d says Mutua. \u201cI am hoping that I will be right. If we don\u2019t land on the sun, we can land on the moon.\u201d"], "authors": [], "keywords": ["ceremony", "children", "kenyas", "warrior", "essay", "battle", "resim", "morans", "school", "samburu", "young", "return", "girls", "bring", "boys", "education"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
