Here are four reasons you should use Credible to find and open a high-yield savings account today.", "You can make more money There are options with no fees and minimum balance accounts Your money will be better protected It could safeguard you from inflation", "1. You can make more money", "The average yield on a traditional savings account is just 0.09% earned annually. With high-yield accounts, interest rates are much higher \u2014 sometimes close to 1%. This can mean a big difference in annual and long-term earnings. Simply put: You can earn more interest on your money with high-yield savings accounts.", "If you're looking to make more interest on your hard-earned cash, then you can start maximizing your earnings today with these high-yield savings options.", "These higher rates can also make achieving your financial goals easier (and faster).

There are options with no fees and minimum balance requirements", "Though some savings accounts \u2014 both high-yield and traditional ones \u2014 come with various monthly fees and minimum balance requirements, not all do. In fact, due to their lack of overhead costs, many online banks can avoid these costly fees and restrictions altogether.", "Monthly fees, eligibility requirements, minimum balance requirements, and interest rates can all vary widely from one banking institution to the next. And it\u2019s just one of the many reasons that it\u2019s important to shop around for your savings account.", "Again, Credible is a great place to shop.

Your money will be better protected", "Most major banks and credit unions are insured, either through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Administration. What that means is your money is protected.", "If the bank or credit union you decide to save with goes out of business or runs out of funds, you\u2019re still guaranteed your money (up to $250,000 on a solo account and $500,000 on a joint account).", "When you\u2019re shopping around for a high-yield savings account, always check to see if an institution has the appropriate insurance.

It could safeguard you from inflation", "When inflation is high, your money loses value, and your buying power drops as a result. Putting your cash in a high-yield savings account can help reduce these losses or even negate them altogether.", "If your account comes with an interest rate higher than the inflation rate, then you win out \u2014 you\u2019ve made more than you lost. If inflation is higher than your interest rate, you\u2019ll still lose buying power, but the earnings on your savings account will help blunt the impact.", "For reference, the current inflation rate sits around 1.3%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the next two years, the Federal Reserve Bank projects it will sit around 2%.", "Again, this is why it\u2019s important to shop around when seeking a high-yield savings account. Securing an account with a higher-than-inflation interest rate can be a great way to safeguard your money in the long haul.", "Should I open a high yield savings account?", "Keep in mind that not all high-yield savings accounts offer these benefits.", "If you want to ensure yours comes with these advantages, then be sure to shop around and compare accounts from several financial institutions.
