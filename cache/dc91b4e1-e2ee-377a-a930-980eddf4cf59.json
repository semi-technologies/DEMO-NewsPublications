It was the final of the Cheltenham and Gloucester Trophy in 2001, which should have been the highlight of his cricket career. Instead, he found himself unable to do what he had been doing his entire life.", "\u201cI became so anxious I froze. I couldn\u2019t let go. It was a nightmare,\u201d Boswell recalled. \u201cHow can I not be able to run up and bowl \u2013 something that I\u2019ve done for so many years without even thinking about it? How can that happen? What\u2019s going on in my brain to stop me doing that, and to make me feel physically sick and anxious and that I can\u2019t do something that I\u2019ve just done so naturally?\u201d", "Boswell was a fast bowler for Leicestershire. After a man of the match performance in the semi-final, he had earned the right to play in the final at a sold-out Lord\u2019s cricket ground, the home of cricket. It was the dream of every county cricketer.", "But Boswell had lost his form in the three weeks since the semi-final, and his place in the final had become less secure. At 10pm the night before the final, Leicestershire\u2019s coach said he wanted to see him. He asked Boswell \u201cwhether I was up for it, and whether I could manage. So there was a seed put in my head before I actually played.\u201d He was finally told he was playing 45 minutes before the game. Somerset, Leicestershire\u2019s opponents, won the toss and chose to bat on a sunny day. Boswell, as one of the opening bowlers, bowled the second over.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Scott Boswell after bowling his sixth wide in the 2001 C&G Trophy final against Somerset. Photograph: Naden Rebecca Naden/PA", "\u201cThe first couple of balls, I felt OK,\u201d he recalled. But on his last ball of the over, Boswell bowled an easy-to-hit short ball that was hit for four runs. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t come out of the hands right \u2026 It just became a little bit stuck.\u201d It signalled trouble ahead. The next over began with a huge wide. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh, Jesus Christ. I\u2019ve never bowled it that wide before \u2013 what\u2019s happened there?\u2019 And that was it. I then bowled another wide, the crowd started to make a bit of noise, I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Crikey.\u2019 It went down the leg side, so I\u2019ve got one on the offside, one on the leg side, I\u2019ve overcompensated and I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d", "An over in cricket comprises six balls \u2013 that is, six balls that are not considered a no-ball or wide. There are normally only a handful of no-balls in an innings. But Boswell\u2019s second over in the final lasted 14 balls, as he repeatedly sprayed the ball too wide of the crease on either side. A YouTube video of the over, entitled The worst over ever? has been watched more than 1.5m times.", "For Boswell, it felt like the over would \u201cabsolutely never end\u201d.", "Failure to manage anxiety and cope with the demands at a crucial moment can lead to a catastrophic drop in performance, known as choking. As the pressure in a match rises, so can an athlete\u2019s anxiety.", "Anxiety is a reaction to pressure or stress. It tends to arise during performances that trigger the fear of losing, or fear of damage to your standing. The symptoms of anxiety are psychological \u2013 worry and fear \u2013 and physiological \u2013 including sweaty palms and an increased heart rate. Anxiety uses up attention and working memory, hindering performance.", "Athletes find themselves thinking about processes that normally come automatically. This was Boswell\u2019s experience. The simple act of bowling a ball, on which his career had been built, suddenly seemed alien. \u201cWhen your conscious mind doesn\u2019t trust your subconscious mind, you\u2019ve got an issue,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the flow and you\u2019re not thinking about it, you just bowl and you just trust your skills.\u201d Of that day at Lord\u2019s, Boswell said: \u201cI just didn\u2019t trust myself. I didn\u2019t trust my action and I didn\u2019t trust my skill set, and then when it was put under high pressure, it failed.\u201d", "When athletes are anxious, they overthink, and focus attention on the technical execution of the skill \u2013 those aspects of the movement that have generally become automated. It has been called \u201cparalysis by analysis\u201d: the mental effort actually inhibits performance. This explains why Boswell, a 26-year-old in his seventh season as a professional cricketer, suddenly found himself unable to bowl straight.", "As his second over became more farcical \u2013 six of his first eight balls were wides \u2013 Boswell recalled the crowd getting \u201clouder and louder\u201d. To try to make the ordeal stop, Boswell rushed, taking less and less time before each ball. \u201cI just remember trying to race through my over to get it completed as quickly as I could. Unfortunately, I sped things up when pressure got to me, rather than trying to slow it down and take a step back, do the breathing, have a little smile \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s only a game of cricket, off you go.\u2019\u201d", "Boswell blames no one but himself, but it might have helped if his teammates had gone up to him and had a chat to help him calm down during his over. At Lord\u2019s, the real problem was that Boswell\u2019s method \u2013 bowling and self-calming \u2013 was not durable enough under pressure. \u201cI probably didn\u2019t have a process if something ever happened. It was just absolute panic.\u201d Boswell only ever played one more game in professional cricket, bowling one terrible over \u2013 including two wides \u2013 before being dropped from the lineup.", "Elite athletes are like the rest of us: they get anxious and it hampers their performance. In the last 30 seconds of tight basketball games, WNBA and NBA players are 5.8% and 3.1% respectively less likely to score from a free throw \u2013 an uncontested shot awarded to players who have been fouled \u2013 than at other moments in the game. When players take free throws in home matches, they are more likely to miss when the crowd is bigger.", "The very best athletes manage to channel the anxiety they feel positively, especially if they have high self-confidence. Athletes with low confidence view anxiety as detrimental to performance, but those with high confidence tend to perceive anxiety as a sign of being ready for the challenge ahead. This makes them less likely to choke under pressure.", "The best athletes are also more adept at brushing off disappointments during competition. The champion golfer Annika S\u00f6renstam jokes that she never hit a bad shot in her life: \u201cI don\u2019t remember them.\u201d Lesser players could be consumed by their mistakes, but S\u00f6renstam would clinically dissect what happened, then get on with the business of trying to recover her position.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to learn how to dissociate \u2013 make a quick analysis, boom.

The shot you\u2019re hitting now is the most important. Ten minutes ago is irrelevant, and who knows what\u2019s going to happen in another 10 minutes.", "\u201cYou have to have a positive mind, you have to stand there and be tension-free. If you stand there and are worried about everything, it\u2019s hard to swing. When I play my best, it\u2019s free-flowing and relaxed, no tension \u2013 just focus and have a target, but you\u2019re relaxed and your muscles can perform. There\u2019s nothing worse than when you try to do something and it\u2019s all tension and pressure and you can\u2019t breathe properly.\u201d", "The best golfers make greater use of positive self-talk, goal-setting and relaxation skills, reporting less worry and less negative thinking. Personality characteristics such as hardiness and even narcissism can further insulate the best athletes from the ravages of anxiety.", "\u201cOf course I felt pressure,\u201d S\u00f6renstam, now retired, recalled. \u201cBut it was a fun pressure \u2013 I wanted to see if I could handle it, just staying true to myself and believing in myself coming down the stretch.\u201d", "For S\u00f6renstam, keeping that belief over 18 holes meant sticking to her routine \u2013 the 24 seconds she liked to take for each shot \u2013 as far as possible, fighting her impulse to speed up. Under pressure, golfers approach shots differently, reducing the range of movement for the head of the golf club and applying greater force to the ball. They rush. In baseball, pitchers who flounder under pressure seem to rush their foot movements and speed up the way they flex their elbows.", "Athletes weighed down by anxiety also use their eyes less efficiently. When table tennis players are anxious, they spend longer fixating on the ball and less time on their opponent, which may reduce their ability to pick up cues and anticipate what will happen next. When tennis players are anxious, they become less effective at picking up contextual information such as the sequencing of shots in the rally and the probability of their opponent playing certain types of shots. Other anxiety-induced responses include hypervigilance \u2013 the \u201cdeer in the headlights\u201d phenomenon \u2013 a narrowed field of view or tunnel vision, or paying attention to irrelevant sights. In each of these cases, anxious athletes are likely to miss critical information.", "When they rush, athletes tend to make worse decisions. Maintaining routines under pressure can help prevent such errors. \u201cThat\u2019s the key \u2013 whether it\u2019s the first green or the 18th green on a Sunday at the US Open or a Pro Am, I just stick to the same routine,\u201d S\u00f6renstam said. \u201cBy doing that, you can deal with the pressure. People think: \u2018People are watching, this putt means this.\u2019 Or \u2018This is a tough hole\u2019, or \u2018It\u2019s an easy hole and I really should make it.\u2019 All these things around you have an effect on how you feel and how you perform. But if you can get less of it into your bubble, that makes it a lot easier.\u201d", "It was the semi-final of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. One of the most extraordinary games of all time was reaching an excruciatingly tense conclusion. South Africa needed 214 to beat Australia and reach their first final.

Facing the bowler was Lance Klusener, who was in the midst of a stunning run of form. In the first two balls of the final over, Klusener crunched both deliveries for four.", "South Africa needed one run from four balls \u2013 with Klusener still facing the ball. At the other end, Allan Donald, South Africa\u2019s No 11 \u2013 a brilliant fast bowler, but the team\u2019s worst batsman \u2013 didn\u2019t need to face a ball.

Klusener hit the ball straight towards a fielder. There was no time for the batsmen to run, yet Donald set off down the pitch.

This time, he didn\u2019t run at all, remaining motionless as Klusener hurtled towards him. By the time Klusener hared past him, all Donald had managed to do was drop his bat and look around forlornly. His legs wouldn\u2019t move. \u201cI looked up at Lance, saw him rushing to my end, and so I started to run,\u201d Donald wrote. \u201cMy legs felt like jelly, as if I wasn\u2019t making any headway at all down to the other end. I tried to get my legs moving properly. It was a dreamlike sequence, almost in slow motion.\u201d", "Donald was paralysed by anxiety \u2013 a classic symptom of choking.

In 2011, they were cruising to victory in the quarter-final before a self-inflicted collapse against New Zealand.

In a classic study on this subject from 1999, scientists asked men and women to take an arithmetic test. Some students were told that men and women performed equally well on the test; the others were told that men performed better. When the scientists told the women that women performed just as well as men, they subsequently performed as well as the men on the test. When women were told that women tended to perform worse, they performed worse than men on the test. Being made aware of the stereotype seemed to affect whether participants would adhere to it or not.", "Stereotype threat can permeate sport, too. It can affect \u201cany situation where you have the possibility or worry that people might judge you based on your inclusion in a certain group \u2013 that could be race, that could be gender, that could be the team you play on,\u201d said Sian Beilock, the cognitive scientist and author of Choke: What the Secrets of the Brain Reveal About Getting It Right When You Have To.", "In sport and life, past failure can make future failure more likely. Since 1999, South African cricketers have lugged stereotype threat around with them, like an unwanted piece of oversized baggage, from one major tournament to the next.

Every choke, real or perceived, creates more of a burden the next time the team is in the same position, making the hurdle even more overwhelming.", "Gareth Southgate spent 22 years looking back at his part in England\u2019s defeat by Germany in a penalty shootout at Euro 96, trying to work out what had gone wrong. His conclusion was that he had rushed. Before he took his sudden-death penalty against Germany, \u201cAll I wanted was the ball: put it on the spot, get it over and done with,\u201d he later wrote. Rushing penalties under pressure damages the chances of scoring: a study found that when players started their run-up less than one second after the referee blew the whistle, the success rate was a paltry 58%. As England manager in 2018, Southgate encouraged the players to take more time from the spot, and led England to their first-ever World Cup penalty shootout win.", "Some athletes are gifted with psychological advantages from birth, but these are not immutable. Interventions designed to increase mental toughness can improve athletes\u2019 performances. The more players practise, the more automated aspects of their movements become, helping athletes to manage anxiety and heighten focus. Maintaining pre-performance routines, as S\u00f6renstam did, makes players more robust under pressure.
