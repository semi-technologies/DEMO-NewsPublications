Famous for transforming plastic water bottles into \u201ctimeless, durable flats,\u201d Rothy\u2019s zero-waste process was laid out like a museum on the walls of the Gramercy Park Hotel Terrace. Bowls of raw thread derived from the very same plastic bottles we throw away lined the candlelit tables next to the shoes in their final form as Ruby Aldridge spun poppy tunes at the deejay booth.", "Regarding the new Merino collection, Rothy's creative director Erin Lowenberg, sat down with Vogue, explaining the partnership with Italian designer, Marta Ferri. \u201cMarta put the romance back in,\u201d Lowenberg said. \u201cTogether we created something really special and deeply heartfelt.\u201d The wool itself was spun at Tollegno 1900, an Italian mill in practice for more than 100 years. \u201cWool is biodegradable. I always say it\u2019s mother nature\u2019s performance material. It\u2019s very versatile, very soft, it\u2019s natural, you can also wash it; it stays clean, lifts away moisture and it lasts.\u201d", "As coupes of Prosecco and brandy cocktails circled the room, artist Gretchen R\u00f6ehrs, drew portraits of guests on the back of Rothy\u2019s lookbook for a keepsake, many of which were sporting a pair of cozy loafers or ballet flats. Katie Holmes, Stella Maxwell, Chanel Iman, and Jameela Jamil were all in agreeance\u2014the shoes really are comfy as you hoped. A glowing Iman appreciated the Chelsea silhouette\u2019s easy slip-on factor. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something comfortable, especially with my pregnancy. Rothy\u2019s shoes are so comfortable and they\u2019re so perfect for pregnancy. I fell in love with them.\u201d", "Holmes, dressed in a Gabriela Hearst slip, also waxed poetic on the slippers. \u201cSustainability should live in as many aspects of our life as possible. I think it\u2019s really inspiring to see this brand not only make a shoe that\u2019s comfortable and wearable but they are making patterns and they\u2019re working with Merino wool and it\u2019s becoming more and more creative.\u201d The collection ranges in fall colors from caramel and hunter green to cranberry and jet black. Actress and activist Jamil, who founded \u201cI Weigh,\u201d a movement checking unregulated Instagram endorsements at the door, gave the most amusing description: \u201cFeels like a cat lying on my foot. Feels so wonderful. It proves that you can make the effort to be ethical and also stylish and comfortable. You can do it all.\u201d", "Rohty\u2019s Merino collection launches on October 8th."], "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lauren Sanche", "Elise Taylor", "Alexandra Macon", "Jenna Rennert", "Zachary Weiss", "Lilah Ramzi", "Tina Isaac-Goiz\u00e9", "Marley Marius"], "url": "https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/rothys-nyc-dinner?mbid=social_onsite_pinterest", "keywords": ["rothys", "katie", "jameela", "collection", "spun", "party", "comfortable", "wool", "really", "shoes", "theyre", "pregnancy", "merino", "flats", "environmentallyconscious", "cocktail", "holmes", "iman", "jamil"], "summary": "Guests took a step in the right direction at Rothy\u2019s socially conscious cocktail in honor of their new Merino Collection.\nRegarding the new Merino collection, Rothy's creative director Erin Lowenberg, sat down with Vogue, explaining the partnership with Italian designer, Marta Ferri.\nKatie Holmes, Stella Maxwell, Chanel Iman, and Jameela Jamil were all in agreeance\u2014the shoes really are comfy as you hoped.\nRothy\u2019s shoes are so comfortable and they\u2019re so perfect for pregnancy.\nYou can do it all.\u201dRohty\u2019s Merino collection launches on October 8th.", "title": "Katie Holmes, Jameela Jamil, and Chanel Iman Celebrated Rothy\u2019s Environmentally-Conscious New Flats With a Cocktail Party"}
