These can be significant. There\u2019s no annual limit on what you pay out of pocket; Part A (hospitalization) has a deductible this year of $1,364 for each episode of illness, plus fixed daily costs for extended stays . Part B (outpatient care) covers 80 percent after you meet the annual deductible ($185 this year). Users of the original program usually also buy a prescription drug plan, with premiums averaging just over $33 a month this year.", "But original Medicare can be less expensive for enrollees who encounter a serious illness and use a lot of services. That is because the annual premiums for Medigap, which cover nearly all cost-sharing requirements in Medicare Part A and B, usually are lower than the out-of-pocket limit found in Advantage plans.", "Advantage plans are required to cap total out-of-pocket spending \u2014 the average among all plans this year for enrollees in H.M.O. or PPO plans is $5,059 for in-network services, according to Kaiser; the average limit rises to $8,818 when Advantage PPO enrollees use out-of-network services.", "Medigap premiums, by contrast, vary greatly by region \u2014 but often it is possible to cap out-of-pocket costs at a lower level than what is available in Advantage plans. In New York City this year, Medigap Plan G plans, among the most comprehensive options, range in cost annually from $2,640 to $5,460, according to Medicare data. But in Nashville, Tenn., the same plans carry premiums ranging from $1,044 to $2,580.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important to look at the doctors and hospitals in the network,\u201d Ms. Neuman said. \u201cMany people are less likely to think about this when they first join Medicare, especially if they are relatively healthy. They don\u2019t really consider whether specialists are in network until they do get a serious illness, which may come years after they first go on Medicare.\u201d", "Advantage enrollees who think they may want to shift to original Medicare with a Medigap plan should do so while they are still healthy. When you first sign up for Part B, Medicare\u2019s \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d rules forbid Medigap plans from rejecting you, or charging a higher premium, because of any pre-existing conditions.
