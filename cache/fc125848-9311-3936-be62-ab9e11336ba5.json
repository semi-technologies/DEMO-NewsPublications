Since May foreigners have snapped up more than $10bn in local-currency debt, reversing a sell-off from the early days of the covid-19 pandemic. There is similar enthusiasm across the region. The six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council issued a record $100bn in public and corporate debt in the first ten months of the year. Treasuries are courting local investors too, though not always successfully: Tunisia\u2019s government was rebuffed when it asked the central bank to buy treasury bonds.", "Arab states are on a borrowing binge. Even before covid-19 arrived many were taking on fresh debt to cope with low oil prices and sluggish economies. The pandemic has only increased their needs. By next year public-debt ratios in many of these countries will be at their highest in two decades (see chart). The region\u2019s 11 oil-and-gas-exporting countries owed an average of 25% of GDP from 2000 to 2016. Next year the IMF projects that ratio will hit 47%. Increases are less stark in states without energy resources\u2014but only because they already had high debt levels.", "This is not always cause for concern. Saudi Arabia\u2019s debt-to- GDP ratio will reach an estimated 34% next year, up from 17% in 2017. Debt levels in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates will almost double as well, to 37% and 38%. These numbers are still comfortably low. All three have well-provisioned central banks or flush sovereign-wealth funds. And capital is cheap: a 35-year tranche of Saudi Eurobonds issued in January had yields below 4%.", "Other oil-producing states look shakier. Bahrain\u2019s debt-to- GDP ratio is projected to hit 131% next year, up from an average of 34% from 2000 to 2016. Oman will owe 89%. Both were largely shut out of bond markets earlier this year. Oil markets offer little hope for their budgets: renewed lockdowns in Europe and rising cases in America pushed prices lower in October.", "Elsewhere in the region the pandemic has reversed years of fiscal reforms. Egypt trimmed subsidies and introduced a value-added tax after borrowing $12bn (over three years) from the IMF in 2016. It cut the deficit from 11% of GDP in 2016 to 7% last year and it was on pace to lower its debt-to- GDP ratio to 79% in 2021. The pandemic, however, sent it back to the IMF for a $5.2bn loan. Next year its debts are projected to climb back to 91% of GDP . Jordan will be close behind at 89%, and Tunisia at 86%.", "For now, at least, investors are enthusiastic about Egyptian debt. Yields are high\u2014the last batch of six-month treasury bills paid around 13.5%\u2014and Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi\u2019s authoritarian rule has erased concerns about political instability. But sentiment can be fickle. Between March and May $12.7bn flowed out of local markets.", "All this borrowing offers limited returns for Arab states. More than 70% of Kuwait\u2019s budget is earmarked for public-sector salaries and subsidies. It is taking on debt not to fund reforms but to sustain a bloated bureaucracy. Arab states have also been stingy with their covid-19 stimulus packages. They have allocated an average of 2% of GDP for pandemic-related help, compared with 3% for all emerging markets, in part because of limited fiscal firepower."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["debt", "investors", "flattening", "arab", "gdp", "2016", "curve", "loading", "imf", "markets", "pandemic", "debtto", "states", "ratio"], "pubDate": "2020-11-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
