Classic DeLillo themes\u2014digital technology, graphology, geopolitics\u2014abound in this slim novel, in which friends gather amid a mysterious cataclysm. On a Sunday in 2022, screens go blank and circuits fail, interrupting a couple\u2019s Super Bowl party and causing a plane to malfunction. As the aircraft goes down, a man on it imagines \u201call those thousands of passengers before us who have experienced this and then were silenced forever.\u201d DeLillo subordinates the characters\u2019 individuality to a wide-angle view of the blackout, and creates a powerful rendering of a crowd unified by a terrifying event that defies all available models of comprehension.", "A Lover\u2019s Discourse, by Xiaolu Guo (Grove). Like the Roland Barthes treatise from which it takes its title, this novel unfolds as a series of vignettes. Guo\u2019s narrator, a recent immigrant to London from China, addresses each episode to her Australian lover. After the Brexit referendum, the couple attempt to reconcile their differences in class, race, and family history through high-minded discussions about art, originality, and language. (\u201cPerhaps I should learn a man\u2019s character by paying attention to the way he uses verbs,\u201d the woman says, after a particularly frustrating miscommunication.) Their ideological disagreements give way to more practical considerations of belonging as they move from England to Australia to Germany, wondering, at each uprooting, if the new locale will assuage their alienation.", "A World Beneath the Sands, by Toby Wilkinson (Norton). In 1798, when Napoleon embarked upon his Egyptian campaign, he brought along some hundred \u201csavants,\u201d tasked with unlocking the secrets of ancient Egypt. The era of Egyptology, vividly detailed in this history, had arrived, with successive European powers using \u201cownership\u201d of Egypt\u2019s archeological riches to assert cultural supremacy. Wilkinson focusses squarely on Western personalities (Egyptian perspectives are largely absent), yet this is not a glorifying account. For every scholarly triumph (the deciphering of the Rosetta stone, say), there is an outrage: artifacts smuggled, workers abused, sex slaves bought. Above all, Wilkinson amply conveys the pettiness, racism, and condescension that underpinned the looting of a civilization.", "Grieving, by Cristina Rivera Garza, translated from the Spanish by Sarah Booker (Feminist Press). In this collection of essays, journalism, and criticism, a noted novelist turns an erudite eye on the damage wrought in Mexico by drug wars, migration, violence against women, and neoliberalism\u2019s erosion of communitarian life. Mining experiences from a lifetime lived in both the United States and Mexico, Rivera Garza returns repeatedly to the vulnerability of the human body and to writing\u2019s potential as a tool of resistance. For all the losses tallied, the pieces are imbued with optimism and an activist\u2019s passion for reshaping the world. In an essay from 2016, just after Donald Trump\u2019s electoral victory, she writes that \u201cperhaps time is just beginning and our lives have just begun.\u201d"], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "keywords": ["delillo", "history", "noted", "egyptian", "mexico", "world", "way", "reviews", "wilkinson", "briefly", "book", "novel", "rivera", "garza"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
