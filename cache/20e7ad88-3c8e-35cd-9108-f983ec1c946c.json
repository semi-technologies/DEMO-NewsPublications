Unencumbered by the messy discussions that have bogged down some democracies, China promptly closed provincial borders, stopped domestic travel, shut down businesses and confined millions of citizens to their homes \u2014 measures that were implemented firmly thanks partly to the state\u2019s surveillance capacity.", "A crisis that risked looking like a systemic meltdown was soon recast as a battle of national will and patriotism \u2014 of the rally-around-the-party, more than rally-around-the-flag, kind.", "Ren Zhiqiang, the real-estate tycoon known as \u201cBig Cannon\u201d Ren, called Mr. Xi a \u201cclown\u201d during the early, difficult stages of the coronavirus outbreak. In the past, Mr. Ren\u2019s excellent connections in the party had afforded him protection for his outspokenness. Not this time. He was investigated for corruption, expelled from the C.C.P. and in September sentenced to 18 years in prison.", "By then, Mr. Xi and the party were enjoying a major propaganda windfall. The population could readily see how the coronavirus had largely stopped spreading in China, whereas a mess was unfolding, again, in the United States and many European democracies, as new outbreaks were about to force some of those countries back into lockdown. China\u2019s economy grew by 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2020, and some economists project that it may soon return to pre-pandemic growth rates.", "The intensifying confrontation between China and the Trump administration has only played into this narrative, allowing Mr. Xi to portray various policies as necessary measures in an existential struggle against an implacable enemy dead-set on destroying China."], "authors": ["Richard Mcgregor"], "keywords": ["mr", "chinas", "coronavirus", "predecessor", "xi", "china", "jinping", "stopped", "party", "strong", "opinion", "soon", "outbreak", "good", "states"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
