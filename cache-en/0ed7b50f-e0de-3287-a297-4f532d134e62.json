The epithet can\u2019t truly pretend to be equivalent to its Spanish \u2013 or even French \u2013 counterpart, being more a way of framing Bayern versus current next best than reference to some historical struggle.", "That Dortmund have grown into their role in the would-be rivalry is a post-2013 Champions League construct, a natural fit with BVB\u2019s own global appeal and their consistent pitching up just shy of throwing distance from Bayern\u2019s windows. What repercussions would it have, though, if they were no longer Bayern\u2019s greatest irritant?", "If it was going to be anyone else, it was always going to be Leipzig. A club that Dortmund see themselves as a diametric opposite to \u2013 and accordingly, one might argue, the confrontations between Leipzig and BVB are laced with considerably more spice that anything involving Bayern \u2013 have had their gaze fixed firmly skyward ever since promotion in 2016, and even the haters have long since been forced to accept it\u2019s a residency, rather than just a stop for lunch, at the top table. Even some of those not instinctively predisposed to tolerating the Leipzig model must admit that they are moving gently towards making inroads into the current hegemony. Bayern had failed to score in only two of their previous 70 matches going into this latest meeting. The opponents on those two occasions? Leipzig.", "How RB Leipzig became the most hated club in German football Read more", "Saturday\u2019s 3-3 Allianz Arena draw between the pair was perhaps not, then, the expected recipe of stopping the Rekordmeister but was more than a thrilling match in itself. It was a suggestion that the Bundesliga might contain some jeopardy going forward into winter and spring, a prospect that has felt less likely given the stumbles of Lucien Favre\u2019s side in recent weeks. We are more than aware of Bayern\u2019s intensive programme \u2013 even though they had only five days\u2019 more involvement in August\u2019s final stages of the Champions League than Leipzig \u2013 and their complicated personnel situation, with a number of injuries even if Hansi Flick, to his credit, has attempted to avoid fully engaging with this theme publicly.", "This was by no means the ideal occasion for Julian Nagelsmann and company to hollow a pothole in Bayern\u2019s lawn either, though. They had made the long journey back from Istanbul in the wee hours of Thursday after just about preserving their hopes of progression in this season\u2019s Champions League at Basaksehir, a match they won once, let slip and then were forced to go and win all over again. Flick\u2019s players, in contrast, were tucked up in bed long before having played Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a virtual dead rubber the night before; dead enough for Manuel Neuer, Robert Lewandowski and Leon Goretzka to stay home while their teammates were on duty in the Spanish capital.", "By Saturday night, the bedsocks seemed like they were still on as Leipzig started with greater purpose. Neuer was caught short of his normal decisiveness for the opening goal, rushing out to intercept Emil Forsberg\u2019s through ball by finding Christopher Nkunku to be a sliver quicker as he slalomed around the goalkeeper and slid the ball into the empty net. It was a historic moment for while Leipzig have caused Bayern difficulty in the recent past, they had never actually scored at the Allianz before.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest A view of the action at the Allianz Arena. Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images", "The home side roused themselves from their slumber, with 17-year-old Jamal Musiala \u2013 who had shone in Madrid \u2013 rifling in a super equaliser before the sort of Bayern team-crafted goal that is simultaneously streamlined and ostentatious was finished by Thomas M\u00fcller. M\u00fcller, perhaps, deserved an assist for audibly urging Musiala \u201cshoot!\u201d before the English midfielder hit the leveller.", "That normally signals the deluge, but Leipzig were level almost instantly via Justin Kluivert, and Forsberg even put the visitors in the lead again in the second half after a sweeping move of Leipzig\u2019s own before M\u00fcller (\u201cone of the people who organises the resistance,\u201d as Flick put it to S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung recently) levelled again. Depleted as Bayern may be Leipzig\u2019s ability to lift themselves was impressive, particularly with their Champions League destiny on the horizon for Tuesday.", "Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \"A beautiful team goal!\" \ud83d\ude0d", "", "Leipzig stun Bayern again with some devastating link up play finished off by Forsberg \ud83e\udd2d pic.twitter.com/50J9NXHdqs", "Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) Thomas Muller always delivers! \ud83d\udc4a", "", "Bayern forward leaps to head home the leveller in six-goal thriller vs. Leipzig \ud83d\udca5 pic.twitter.com/ckGS9nnvCx", "Nagelsmann had spoken before the game about his team\u2019s need to tread a tightrope between ambition and foolhardiness, particularly given their schedule. \u201cMy boys want to win the game and will give it their all,\u201d he had said, \u201c[but] we also need to keep in mind that we have a must-win game in the Champions League against Manchester United next Tuesday, and we must make logical and smart decisions.\u201d For all the artistic merit of their game\u2019s high points and the wild oscillation of the scoring, Leipzig were able to play economically and, in the wake of M\u00fcller\u2019s second-half equaliser, tidily.", "The hope is that Nagelsmann\u2019s senior men will continue to set the tone as they face United. Whilst it was natural to wonder before the season if Leipzig\u2019s youth-first policy had reached its zenith in the Lisbon semi-final, experience has crept up on them almost more by circumstance than design. Forsberg, at 29 and after a few fallow-ish seasons, has re-emerged as a force and Kevin Kampl (30) continues to be hugely influential after returning from injury. Their importance is manifest \u2013 \u201cboth of them know what a beer tastes like,\u201d in the words of Leipziger Volkszeitung\u2019s Guido Sch\u00e4fer.", "The visit of United might have the greatest importance in the immediate context but this match \u2013 a pretty inconvenience in the calendar \u2013 will live in the memory. Even more so if it proves to be a semi-template for the future of the Bundesliga, rather than a curio of the times.", "Quick guide Bundesliga results Show Hide Hertha Berlin 3-1 FC Union Berlin, Arminia Bielefeld 2-1 Mainz, Cologne 2-2 Wolfsburg, Eintracht Frankfurt 1-1 Borussia Dortmund, SC Freiburg 2-2 Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Bayern Munich 3-3 RB Leipzig, Werder Bremen 1-2 Stuttgart, Schalke 0-3 Bayer Leverkusen", "Talking points", "\u2022 Elsewhere in what we hope is the title race, Dortmund extended their winless run in the Bundesliga to three \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly given they haven\u2019t won at Eintracht Frankfurt since 2013 and they are facing a pile of injuries (including Erling Haaland). Gio Reyna\u2019s magnificent equaliser saved a point in a strong second-half display and Dan-Axel Zagadou made a welcome comeback.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dortmund players after being held in Frankfurt.

Unfortunately for the visitors the rather too-psyched-up Robert Andrich saw red minutes later for a wild challenge and Hertha ground it out, with Krzysztof Piatek hitting a quickfire brace late on to seal it. Another blow for Union was that Max Kruse will be out for eight weeks after tearing a thigh muscle late on.", "\u2022 If this column has one bit of YouTube-based advice, it\u2019s to look up Silas Wamangituka\u2019s winner for Stuttgart at Werder Bremen, painstakingly toed over the line in a way that absolutely enraged the home side\u2019s Davie Selke.", "Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) Have you ever seen anything like this? \ud83d\ude02", "", "The simplest of finishes for Stuttgart's Silas Wamangituka...", "", "Bremen didn't like it and he was duly booked for unsportsmanlike conduct \ud83d\ude2c pic.twitter.com/6uaP5XRASG", "\u2022 26.
