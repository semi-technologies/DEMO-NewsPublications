Disappointed himself, when he didn\u2019t finish him off then and there. When the hateful old man\u2019s time up, wouldn\u2019t his moans for morphine or death be music to my ears, he thinks. Mehr Licht the last words attributed to a dying Goethe. German words, niece, meaning \u201cmore light,\u201d and still sounding a bit like Mehr Licht when translated into English. More dark, that old darkie will gasp. Darkness to hide him, to cover up his fears, his rage, his betrayals, his shame.", "But no point, he had decided that day in a faraway courthouse, no point in killing a nasty old man. Tutsi corpses don\u2019t return to life no matter how high the piles of Hutu corpses. Or vice versa.", "At home in his bedroom, old-man eyes stare into emptiness between remembered/forgotten steps of untying his tie, loosening laces, removing shoes, rolling down crusty-toed, silk socks. Why commit a crime, he had asked himself. Risk his freedom killing the bastard when surely disease will rot his old body and perform a more impeccable, patient, subtle, sustained, excruciating assassination than he could ever hope to achieve.", "Story of any country\u2019s citizens massacring fellow-citizens is many stories coming true, he will say to his niece. Also many stories becoming untrue. Yours. Ours. Thought experiments. Many stories redone. Stories crucified. Halal. Kosher. Bled white. Sanctified. Eaten. Goodness born inside each person along with evil, my dear, but goodness doesn\u2019t prosper like evil prospers. The woes an old, naked man\u2014warden, keeper of the flame, keeper of coloreds, fellow-colored, colored fellow\u2014has inflicted upon others defy words. Best revenge not to take his life, but to wish more years on him. Life everlasting interrupted daily, every hour on the hour, by death of one thousand self-inflicted cuts.", "\u201cHoney, are you doomscrolling again?\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Leise Hook", "Maybe more mercy than he deserves, his niece or someone else might suggest. Too much mercy for a person who remains, until their dying day, willing to abuse others. How many times to please himself had he, like the old man, violated another person\u2019s trust. Acted as if he knew the world going to end in a quick minute and no consequences that matter would follow his actions. As if whatever comes next could never matter more than the sweet pleasure of pretending no tomorrow for him or his victim to fret about. No questions asked. No hesitation. Just a game, after all.", "Of course, more than contempt had motivated him to spy through a window on an evil old colored man fumbling around in a dark room. Whose story was he attempting to tell anyway. To whom. He already understood more than enough about the man. Knows him much too well. Bitter, bitter knowledge. Studies him because he fears him. And you should fear him, too, girl, he will say. Always, he will say. Beware. Beware. Sorry as I am to admit it, dear heart, yours truly is very much like him. Both of us men who should know better. No excuse. Way, way, way too greedy. Too busy. Way too selfish. Too accomplished at getting what we want. Everything. Nothing. No matter who or how many we destroy.", "II.", "A few days ago on his early-morning walk\u2014no risk of getting hit by a car, sweet niece\u2014dawn and streets more quiet and deserted than usual, even at dawn, even during the unnatural calm of lockdown and sequestering the city has imposed upon its residents to slow the spread of an epidemic sickening and killing thousands. He\u2019d encountered almost no people, no traffic. Nearly absolute silence on streets leading to the walkway along the East River.", "Close to the water\u2019s edge, he turned left, headed uptown, in the direction of Harlem, not on the paved, guardrailed, concrete walkway, but on a path through growing things\u2014grass, bushes, shrubs, moss, flowers, weeds, trees\u2014life someone had the good sense to preserve or plant and create park-like stretches paralleling the river. On his side of tall, black cyclone fences that protected tennis courts, running tracks and ball fields, he saw the same discarded paperback book he had been noticing for a couple days, a pale, bulky lump still lying there atop late-May grass, near the mud-colored path scuffed into brown earth by many, many footsteps, the skittering trail he was negotiating, only a bit wider than a shoe length, mile of path, improvised about a yard away from fifteen-foot-high black wire fences. Curiosity he had managed to resist on previous sightings won this time. He stopped, used a foot to turn it over, and discovered the book\u2019s title, \u201cSnow,\u201d on its torn cover, a novel by coincidence he happened to have read, its author a famous Turkish writer, and he was trying hard to remember the writer\u2019s name, remember more about the book, unable to take another step until he forced himself to remember more, embarrassed, ashamed when he couldn\u2019t. Silence of the morning, stillness of the streets on his way to the East River all he could recall.", "Then snow. Instantly the green grass, the brown earth, the book are buried under whiteness. Huge snowflakes filling the air around him. If it had been a scene he read in the novel\u2019s pages, he might have dismissed it as \u201cmagical realism.\u201d But no, it was not words. No. Snow present. Snow a deluge of giant flakes slowly descending, snow dropping into the East River, turning edges of water into icy sheets, snow beginning to obscure tall towers\u2014most completed, some under construction, crowned by skeletal arms of cranes\u2014looming a half mile away on the river\u2019s opposite bank, snow falling until it buries that distant cityscape and all the buildings disappear.", "Will he ever be able to express to her (or maybe she already understands\u2014smart pretty niece by way of smart pretty niece\u2014and maybe she will help him understand better) the painful complicity of inhabiting a world that holds his imprisoned brother, and holds another who is a prison.", "III.", "Not exactly reparations, I say to my brother during the second phone call to me he\u2019s been permitted after a hearing that denied parole, an old colored man (is he a soul brother of the b\u00eate noire my dreams spy on) presiding. My brother turned down for the fifth straight year since he became eligible, after twenty-five years, to apply once a year for parole. Not exactly reparations, I smile and wag my head, though my brother can\u2019t see me do it nor do I quite hear his little laugh nor see that smart-aleck smirk that wrinkles up my brother\u2019s face since he was twelve. Silence on the other end of the phone line connecting us, him trapped inside, me trapped outside stone walls, but I keep talking, carefully of course, since our conversations are monitored and my words can be used against him. Say the story I saw on the NBC Nightly News not exactly reparations after four hundred years of damage, but maybe a step in the right direction. Whadda you think, man. Story the feel-good bit in these godawful times Lester always tacks on at the end of each broadcast. A project in a laundromat to teach preschool ghetto kids to read. Good idea, huh, though maybe a better idea, the best idea, just to stop pretending altogether they give a fuck. Excuse me. Give a damn. Probably my own bad mood as much as anything else, bro, but that piece made me so mad, so ashamed, I wanted to scream. Cry. Enslavement a terrible crime\u2014just about everybody concedes that fact today\u2014but all the victims and perpetrators dead, we\u2019re told, if we ask. Not spoken about if no one asks. America\u2019s gaping, cosmic black hole and here they come with another Band-Aid to patch it. Cringed when I saw those video clips of kids listening to grownups read, kids spozed to be learning to read inside some ugly fuck . . . damn laundromat in a raggedy-ass neighborhood. Let it bleed, I thought. Better to let it bleed. All of us falling one day, sucked into a black hole, but some of us encumbered with all the shit they\u2019ve stolen will fall through faster, and the rest of us left behind, separated a blessed minute from those ruthless, greedy, toxic thieves at last, and maybe then at the end we might get a little smidgen of peace then.", "Laundromat. Yeah. Yeah. Huge, barn-ass, noisy room and preschoolers stuck there anyway on wash day with mamas or grandmamas or aunts or big sis or whoever washes everybody\u2019s clothes so why not. It\u2019s available, cheap, plenty clients on hand regularly. Just bring in a couple volunteers and organize the locals, encourage them to read to the little burr-heads instead of just sitting around half the day smoking dope or doing nothing while all those machines rumbling, tumbling. Why not get the women involved who spawn too many colored kids. Teach them to sit their babies down and read to them instead of letting them run wild inside a filthy laundromat. And if mama missed that alphabet class in school, teach mama the alphabet, too. Makes perfect sense in a way. You know. Like, yes, please give our children a little extra head-start push. So niggers don\u2019t fail because they start out\u2014first day in kindergarten\u2014far behind other kids. Except everybody knows ain\u2019t no rule says niggers got to catch up. Four hundred years and we ain\u2019t caught up yet.", "Makes sense and no sense. Teaching ghetto kids to read a couple hours a week in some loud, crowded, funky laundromat, bro. As if it\u2019s the best school the richest country on earth can afford for them. What kind of fucking catch-up is that. Four hundred years and counting of starting out unequal. That amounts to some serious left-behind. Four hundred years\u2019 worth. And we spozed to catch up while our clothes getting clean. Why not slam up every single colored one of us into laundromats and lock the doors. Only let out a few, now and then. Ones who read well.", "IV.", "She sticks the check from her uncle back in its envelope, envelope in her bag to deposit next day in the bank after work. Money her uncle sent for her other uncle, the one she\u2019s seen only a few times in life, and never outside prison, where he\u2019s been since before she was born, money her uncle had asked her to begin taking charge of this year, money in a lump sum he sends for her to dispense to his brother, her uncle said, both to connect her more closely with her imprisoned uncle and to encourage more visits to the prison, his hope. Requesting that she dole out to his brother in small, regular amounts the money he sends her, either when she visits and can put cash directly into a prison account or JPay it through Internet, the second option equally available to her college-educated uncle wherever he is, she\u2019s tempted to remind him, though he always claims the Internet \u201cbefuddles him.\u201d Smallish portions, he schools her. Best not to forward too much money at one time because my younger sibling has a fondness for gambling and we don\u2019t want to tempt him, do we, dear heart, my uncle said. Little bro\u2019s fondness for risk and his boundless optimism insure he\u2019ll keep chasing after other folks\u2019 bad money until he loses all the little taste of good money in his hand, my uncle says, talking over the phone in that odd, elaborate way of his she thinks he must be as fond of as he claims his younger brother fond of gambling.", "Her uncle had asked her once, Do you truly believe you\u2019re colored. Hey. Don\u2019t be looking at me all cross-eyed, young lady. A serious question. Do you, we, all of us still believe we are colored just because they keep telling us we are. Colored. Different. A damned shame.", "Her odd uncle, book writer, wanderer, seldom in town. Her dead mom\u2019s uncle, really, Grandma\u2019s older brother. Her dead mom her grandma\u2019s eldest daughter, the man\u2019s actual niece, and that makes her what\u2014great-niece, niece-in-law, second niece\u2014whatever to this man she\u2019s standing next to on her grandmother\u2019s porch and always called Uncle since she was a baby, the wannabe front porch not much larger than a final step up to Grandma\u2019s house. Her house, too. For many years, she and her mom, after her beautiful mom got divorced, got sick, living there with Granddaddy and Grandma, her grandma who still misses a lost daughter seven years gone, mourns her lost daughter as fiercely, unconsolably, it seems and does not seem possible, as she does, daughter of that lost daughter who misses and mourns her mom, yes she does, still does very much, especially now, on this narrow, crooked front porch where she stands in the dark after family had gathered to talk and eat and drink themselves holiday-silly and each one finally at this late hour has had more than enough and begins peeling away into smaller family groups. Or a few, like her, alone, though her uncle beside her now, middle of the night, isn\u2019t it, and dangerous out there in the streets, and Uncle makes it his habit, whenever he\u2019s around, to escort each solitary family female outdoors, a sentinel on the porch until she\u2019s locked in her car, motor running, lights on and car rolls off, up or down the dark, steep hillside upon which his sister\u2019s house perches. Uncle there, bodies lightly touching when his arm goes round her shoulders and he leans down, kisses her cheek, and if her cheek just a wee bit higher or he leaned lower, his lips might have brushed hers, but didn\u2019t, no lip brushing because she\u2019s tough like her mom, though also unafraid like her, and believes, like her mom did, neither in sin, nor in everlasting romance of any mouth, uncle or anybody else on her mouth, knows better, raised better by her dead mom who nods gently, whispers best not, of course not, girl, best go on and get your behind down those treacherous slabs of broken concrete that serve as steps up and down from the sidewalk to your grandma\u2019s red front door. Glad now she chose sneakers and jeans not heels and dress for the family party. Don\u2019t break your butt, girl, careful, careful now, get yourself down step by step till your feet on solid street and your car door locked, and you got yourself sitting behind the wheel, girl.", "Her uncle tall. Not as tall as tall, gorgeous Riley. Thirty smiling foot of Riley in skimpy running shorts, T-shirt, fanciest of training shoes postered for months up on a wall next to Kmart entrance to the mall. Liked Riley lots. Maybe still with him. Maybe if he shared fewer of those dumb notions guys his age, especially fine ones like finest Riley, share. Gimme some. Get me some. Cop me a piece of pussy. What in the world did they think we carry around down there between our legs, her mom asked once, think we can break off and wrap it up and send it home with them or they can grab and show off to their friends.", "Her uncle had asked her, If you found out, a secret, no doubt about it, world going to end very, very soon, would you tell other people. With that knowledge buzzing around in your brain, my dear, what would you do. Then her uncle had stopped talking. Stopped explaining experiments or games, stopped asking questions. Looked at her. Waited. Waited. As if he expected an answer. Since she had no idea what to reply, she asked him, What would you do, Uncle. He smiled at her, then closed his eyes and whispered, If I knew sure enough the world about to end, think I\u2019d probably kidnap you, girl, and run far away with you, and my, my, wouldn\u2019t that be a trip, and wouldn\u2019t people talk.", "And she had smiled back, smile deep as his smile because she believed her old uncle just talking, just teasing.
