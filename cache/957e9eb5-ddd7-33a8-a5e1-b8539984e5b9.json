The author believes the new book will allow the box office champion of the \u201860s and \u201870s to finally share his story.", "JOHNNY CASH REMAINED DEVOTED TO HIS FAITH DESPITE DRUG WOES, WAS NEARLY KILLED BY AN OSTRICH, BOOK REVEALS", "\u201cMany of these interviews have never seen the light of day,\u201d said Terrill. \u201cI started this book in 2014 and it took years to compile everything together told by Steve McQueen himself. A lot of people have always written him off as just a blue-collar guy who liked motorcycles and cars. But if you read his words, the man has great wisdom to him. He\u2019s got this rich life experience that I wanted to share with people.\u201d", "\u201cThe reality is, Steve McQueen didn\u2019t really like talking about himself,\u201d Terrill shared. \u201cSo when he did, there were these little flashes where he unveiled his true self.\u201d", "For the book, Terrill discovered documents that give clearer insight on who McQueen\u2019s father was -- a man the star desperately tried to track down in his lifetime but was three months too late. According to Terrill, McQueen was on the cusp of stardom with \u201cWanted: Dead or Alive\" when William McQueen, a Merchant Marine, died of cirrhosis of the liver in November 1958. The patriarch was buried in an unmarked grave in Long Beach, Calif.", "\u201cI finally traced him to a small town here in California, but it was too late,\u201d McQueen recalled. \u201cHe died three months earlier -- so we never got to see each other. His friends told me he used to watch me on TV and that he was real proud of me. But maybe they just said it because they figured I wanted to hear it\u2026 I wanted to stand in front of him, just face him squarely and ask why he left us the way he did. It did hurt my mother at the time, and it hurt me later.\u201d", "JOHNNY CASH'S FORMER MANAGER TACKLED SINGER'S DRUG BATTLES BUT QUIT OVER RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES, BOOK CLAIMS", "After a stint in the Marines, McQueen found refuge on the stage when he gave acting a shot in the early \u201850s. However, despite the fame and fortune he achieved in Hollywood, McQueen always yearned for something else -- and he finally found it toward the end of his life.", "\u201cIn the search for his father, he was also looking for his heavenly father,\u201d Terrill explained. \u201cAt the end of his life, he met a pilot named Sammy Mason, who was probably 10-15 years older than Steve. However, Sammy had a special presence about him. One day, Steve finally said, \u2018There\u2019s something different about you. I can\u2019t put my finger on it.\u2019 Sammy said, \u2018Well Steve, I\u2019m a born-again Christian.\u2019 And from that point on, Steve wanted to emulate him.\u201d", "According to Terrill, McQueen became so intrigued by Christianity that he asked if he could go to church with Mason. McQueen met pastor Leonard DeWitt and later \u201cgrilled him for two hours\u201d during lunch.", "\u201cLeonard said, \u2018Well Steve, I only have one question for you,\u2019\u201d said Terrill. \u201c[Steve] goes, \u2018You want to know if I\u2019m a born-again Christian?\u2019 Leonard replied, \u2018Yes, Steve, that\u2019s all that really matters to me.\u2019 And then Steve said, \u2018Yes. Do you remember a couple of weeks ago when you asked everyone to bow their heads and accept Jesus Christ? Well, I closed my eyes and did that.\u201d", "STEVE MCQUEEN\u2019S EX-WIFE NEILE ADAMS BLAMES \u2018FREE LOVE\u2019 FOR FAILED MARRIAGE", "Terrill pointed out that columnist Liz Smith was the first to report that McQueen became a born-again Christian in June 1979 -- nearly six months before he was officially diagnosed with cancer.", "When McQueen later learned he had a rare, normally fatal form of lung cancer, he reached out to evangelist Billy Graham.", "\u201cSteve McQueen knew he was dying,\u201d said Terrill. \u201cSo he requested Billy Graham to come to see him. And so Billy did, right before Steve McQueen left to go to Mexico for his last operation. They were going to pray together when Steve said, \u2018I don\u2019t have my Bible.\u2019\"", "\"Billy Graham instinctively gave him his Bible,\" Terrill continued. \"It became Steve\u2019s prized possession. To Steve, like many people, Billy Graham was perhaps the closest thing that you could probably get to God on Earth. I think Steve wanted to tap on his knowledge. Steve wanted to share testimony with him and what Christ did for him.\u201d", "STEVE MCQUEEN WAS PLAGUED WITH INSECURITIES CAUSED BY HIS TROUBLED CHILDHOOD, REPORT SAYS", "McQueen was in a Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, hospital for surgery on a massive tumor when he was stricken with a heart attack, the Los Angeles Times reported. The outlet reported the cancer had spread widely through his upper body. Terrill said when McQueen was found, he was still clutching to Graham\u2019s Bible. McQueen died on what was Graham\u2019s 62nd birthday.", "Graham passed away in 2018 at age 99.", "Terrill hopes his book will shed some light on how McQueen viewed his legacy over the years.", "\u201cBefore cancer, McQueen\u2019s outlook on life was very cynical,\u201d said Terrill. \u201cI think Christianity gave him comfort. He was going to announce that he was a Christian but he never got that opportunity. But he did promise that if he got well, he was going to make that announcement. He revealed that his body is gone, it\u2019s broken, but his spirit isn\u2019t broken and his heart isn\u2019t broken. I think that says it all.\u201d"], "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "keywords": ["wanted", "finally", "book", "died", "terrill", "succumbing", "comfort", "christian", "billy", "graham", "life", "bornagain", "cancer", "mcqueen", "steve"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
