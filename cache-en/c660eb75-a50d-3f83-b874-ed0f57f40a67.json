We knew that, we privileged few who could have offered an inventory of the lawsuit\u2019s flaws while standing on one foot. We had not the slightest doubt that the case was a non-starter.", "Or did we?", "I spent much of last week, nearly up to the moment on Friday night when the court tossed the Texas case into history\u2019s garbage bin, assuring friends and strangers alike that Texas v. Pennsylvania had no merit whatsoever. Texas had no business invoking the court\u2019s original jurisdiction \u2014 seeking to come directly to the Supreme Court and bypassing the lower courts \u2014 in order to complain directly to the justices about other states\u2019 election processes. The justices, I added, would never permit themselves to be drawn into such a sorry charade.", "Many people who emailed me with their questions knew little about the Supreme Court and its jurisdictional quirks, but some were lawyers or avid court-followers who know a lot. Their anxiety was a measure of how much of what we once took for granted has been upended during these past four years. I confess that by the end of the week, the tiniest shadow of doubt had invaded my own mind. And no wonder: The usual inference that even young children are able to draw from experience \u2014 \u201cThis has never happened before so it\u2019s very unlikely to be happening now\u201d \u2014 has proved of dubious utility. We can know all the facts and all the rules, but still, we can\u2019t be sure.", "In the aftermath, with the electoral votes counted and the justices off on their four-week winter recess, what more is there to say about the justices\u2019 refusal to grant the Trump team and its statehouse enablers their day in court? It\u2019s easy to understand why the response offered by Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Dana Nessel, became the go-to quote in many accounts of the week\u2019s denouement. The court, she said, delivered \u201can important reminder that we are a nation of laws, and though some may bend to the desire of a single individual, the courts may not.\u201d"], "authors": ["Linda Greenhouse"], "keywords": ["offered", "know", "texas", "courts", "states", "justices", "opinion", "supreme", "week", "knew", "thank", "court"], "pubDate": "2020-12-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
