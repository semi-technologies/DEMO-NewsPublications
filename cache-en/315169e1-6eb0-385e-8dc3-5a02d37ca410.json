Flawed characters were likable; diversity was normalised not signposted. It was family-friendly, and largely unserious, yet high-concept and high-brow. And best of all, it starred Ted Danson as Michael, the \u201carchitect\u201d of this utopian ideal, dressed in a tweed jacket with pastel-coloured bow ties.", "When it eventually bowed out with an analogy about a wave and Arvo P\u00e4rt\u2019s Spiegel im Spiegel, Michael had got what he wanted \u2013 to become a human called Michael Realman who lived in a new build in LA. It was a physical transformation achieved simply by replacing his tweeds with an 80s grandad get-up of plaid shirt, jeans and New Balance trainers.", "This is not a piece about Ted Danson. It\u2019s not even about Sam Malone, his Cheers character who has a cameo in season two of The Good Place and whom he eventually (sort of) morphs into \u2013 though it could be either, impossible as it is to separate the warm, winning actor from the warm, winning characters he often plays. Nor is it a piece about fashion, because there is nothing fashionable about the bow ties that Michael adopts, or the late sitcom character he becomes. It is a piece about a man in a bow tie trying to hold it together in a decaying world. Or, to put it more simply, a man trying to pass for the Platonic ideal of a 60-year-old when he is actually, really, a 6,000ft-tall fire squid.", "\u2018A reminder of a time when work and home were not one and the same\u2019 ... Ted Danson as Michael. Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images", "Watching in lockdown, Michael the architect is a stark reminder that 2020 was the year we stopped getting dressed. Tahani\u2019s strapless dresses and Chidi\u2019s sweater-vests might seem more current, but maybe that\u2019s the point. Wearing something that can only be described as \u201centhusiastic academic of yore\u201d, Michael\u2019s professorial ensemble reminds me of a time when work and home were not one and the same, way, way back in 2019.", "As do Michael\u2019s further attempts to humanise himself, little details of which were designed as punchlines but now, almost a year on, make me nostalgic. The lavender hankies folded in his pocket like origami, playing on the idea of transformation instead of being used to blow your nose. The car keys he keeps just so he can lose them, when that was your biggest problem. The executive stress ball, which he \u201cmay or may not\u201d throw out, reminiscent of the offices we no longer enter. And the blow-by-blow knowledge of every episode of Friends, a show not simply featuring an open coffee shop but largely based in one.", "If Michael\u2019s bow ties are also the best stylistic tic since Velma\u2019s glasses in Scooby-Doo, then they are just as remarkable for their absence. When things are good, they appear resplendent in plaid or paisley or peacock print. When things are bad (say, season two, when Michael gets \u201cfound out\u201d), the bow is relegated to a tie, somehow making him look incredibly ordinary. In the final episode, he removes it altogether and attempts to exit the afterlife, as if the bow tie is the one thing keeping him there. In another episode, as Michael battles with technology, he even becomes WFH Michael in an oatmeal hoodie and jogging bottoms, fine stubble migrating across his face, complaining about stress eating, his bow tie undone and hanging round his neck.", "\u2018A show that holds a mirror up to our stupid selves\u2019 ... Ted Danson as Michael and Kristen Bell as Eleanor in The Good Place. Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images", "Compounded by the very essence of the show \u2013 that by existing we owe each other something \u2013 a moral code based on TM Scanlon\u2019s What We Owe to Each Other, his transformation not only reminded us of the brilliance of Danson, it also held up a mirror to our stupid neoliberal selves.", "Ultimately, though, it\u2019s the bow ties that finally betray him. James Bond wore a bow tie, but on TV they tend to signify fools, technocrats and oddballs \u2013 see Frank from The Vicar of Dibley or Carlton in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Clever people wear them. People passing as clever also wear them. No one ever successfully seduced a woman in one. And no one ever left the afterlife without one. The idea that Michael is so curious about humans that he chooses to dress like one is funny now, though perhaps for all the wrong reasons."], "authors": ["Morwenna Ferrier"], "keywords": ["places", "tv", "good", "ties", "tie", "transformation", "simply", "icons", "ted", "place", "2020", "michael", "demon", "danson", "dapper", "style", "bow"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
