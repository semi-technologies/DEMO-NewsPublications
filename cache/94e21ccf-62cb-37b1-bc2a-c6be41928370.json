{"pubDate": null, "title": "Trump\u2019s Call for China to Investigate the Bidens Shows How Far He\u2019ll Go to Save Himself", "paragraphs": ["When Donald Trump blew up at a Reuters reporter on Wednesday for asking what he wanted Volodymyr Zelensky, the President of Ukraine, to do about Joe and Hunter Biden, he sounded like a street thug. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d he snarled, before accusing the reporter, Jeff Mason, of being part of the \u201cfake news media\u201d and the \u201ccorrupt media.\u201d But on Thursday morning, when Trump spoke with the press pool on the White House lawn, before departing for a health-care event in Florida, he appeared to be on a more even keel. Perhaps he\u2019d got a decent night\u2019s sleep. Whatever it was, he mentioned health care, talked up the economy, and then took some inevitable questions about the Ukraine scandal, including one that was a virtual replay of what Mason had asked him the previous day.", "This time, Trump answered calmly and directly. \u201cWell, I would think that if they were honest about it they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d he said, gesticulating with his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens. Because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed . . .\u201d Instead of finishing this question, he changed tack. \u201cAnd, by the way, likewise China should start an investigation into the Bidens. Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d", "In July, 2016, Trump famously called on Russia to find thirty thousand of Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mails, which hadn\u2019t been handed over to the F.B.I. At the time, his request seemed pretty outrageous, but it wasn\u2019t entirely clear whether he might have been joking, and, in any case, he was an office-seeker rather than an officeholder. But now there he stood as the President of the United States, already facing an impeachment inquiry, and he was openly calling on two foreign governments\u2014no longer just one\u2014to investigate a political opponent and his son.", "Why did he do it? In trying to fend off the threat of impeachment, Trump can\u2019t adopt the standard defense\u2014\u201cI\u2019m innocent\u201d\u2014because the public record shows that he isn\u2019t. The White House\u2019s own notes of his July 25th conversation with Zelensky capture him asking the Ukrainian President to speak with Rudy Giuliani about the Bidens. And the anonymous whistle-blower\u2019s complaint details how, in advance of speaking with Zelensky, he had placed a hold on hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. At a minimum, these documents demonstrate that Trump leaned on a foreign leader to investigate one of his political opponents. Whether this squeeze play broke campaign-finance law is subject to debate: evidently, his own Justice Department decided that it hadn\u2019t. But it was the kind of egregious behavior that the Framers of the Constitution had in mind when they included the impeachment clause.", "With all this as clear as could be, Trump has settled on a different defense strategy, and his statements on the White House lawn illustrated it. Rather than denying the central charge against him\u2014abuse of Presidential power\u2014he\u2019s now embracing it, giving it his public imprimatur. His thinking appears to be that America is now so polarized that his supporters will say it\u2019s perfectly fine for him to ask foreign countries to investigate his political opponents, and elected G.O.P. officeholders will quietly acquiesce to it. And the most dreadful thing is he may not be wrong. As Thursday wore on, there was a deafening silence from Republicans on Capitol Hill.", "In case anyone hadn\u2019t got the message about Ukraine and China, Trump repeated it for emphasis. \u201cSo, I would say that President Zelensky,\u201d he went on, after bringing up China, \u201cif it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens, because nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked.\u201d When a reporter asked if he had urged President Xi to open an investigation, he replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about. Because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like to be under that type of scrutiny, where billions of dollars is being taken out of his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy. . . . They call that a payoff.\u201d", "Did Trump provide any evidence to back up these accusations against the Bidens, which he\u2019s been levelling for weeks now? Of course not. It should be pointed out, just for the record, that the Ukrainian authorities have largely debunked his claims about the Bidens, and on Thursday CNN turned up a 2016 letter in which three Republican senators asked the then President of Ukraine to make changes in the office of the country\u2019s prosecutor general, whose ouster Joe Biden had demanded. As for China, BHR Partners, the private-equity company that Hunter Biden co-founded in 2014, with an American partner and two Chinese entities, ended up raising 4.2 million dollars, not billions, according to Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer. Also, the money was raised for investment purposes\u2014it wasn\u2019t a lump sum given to Hunter Biden.", "Trump doesn\u2019t care about facts, of course. Aping the tactics of demagogues everywhere, he\u2019s trying to create a diversion and seeking to identify his own personal interests with those of the country at large. It\u2019s a strategy of deliberate incitement, in which he has already accused one of his accusers, the Democrat Adam Schiff, of treason and quoted an evangelical pastor who said that removing him from office would lead to a civil war. Where it will all end nobody can say, but we do know that Trump will do or say virtually anything to save his hide, and he\u2019ll insist to the last that he did nothing wrong."], "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-call-for-china-to-investigate-the-bidens-shows-how-far-hell-go-to-save-himself", "keywords": ["far", "bidens", "hell", "start", "say", "ukraine", "china", "investigation", "shows", "investigate", "trumps", "trump", "president", "save", "zelensky"], "summary": "\u201cWell, I would think that if they were honest about it they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d he said, gesticulating with his hands.\nThey should investigate the Bidens.\n\u201cAnd, by the way, likewise China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\nAt a minimum, these documents demonstrate that Trump leaned on a foreign leader to investigate one of his political opponents.\nIn case anyone hadn\u2019t got the message about Ukraine and China, Trump repeated it for emphasis.", "authors": ["John Cassidy", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Adam Entous", "Richard Brody", "Jeffrey Toobin", "David Rohde"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35", "id": "94e21ccf-62cb-37b1-bc2a-c6be41928370"}
