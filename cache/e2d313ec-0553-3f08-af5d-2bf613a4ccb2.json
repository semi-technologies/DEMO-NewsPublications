On November 3, Bailis\u2019s shift will begin at 5 a.m. and stretch until 9 p.m. She\u2019s prepared: \u201cI will be setting no less than four alarms, my outfit will be fully planned, and my bags [pre-packed],\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have enough time to make some coffee while it\u2019s pitch black out.\u201d", "In New York City, where Bailis is volunteering, voters are also showing up in record-breaking numbers, which can mean wait times upwards of five hours. This isn\u2019t Bailis\u2019s first time volunteering, but she recognizes this experience will be a different kind of challenge. \u201cI spent time earlier in the year phone banking\u2026which has allowed me to help out in the comfort of sweatpants.\u201d", "On Election Day, she\u2019s planning to switch up her look: \u201cGetting dressed in a more structured outfit puts me in a more professional and confident mood,\u201d Bailis says. Since weather can be unpredictable, she\u2019s relying on a few key layering pieces to keep her comfortable throughout the day: a black wool turtleneck paired under a Y\u2019s by Yohji Yamamoto cotton shirt and a Lemaire cotton twill vest. \u201cKeeping with the layering theme, I\u2019m wearing a pair of Wolford tights (the only ones that I can confidently know will stay up the entire day and won\u2019t run) under a pair of Uniqlo U shorts, and a pair of vintage Donald J. Pliner suede, mid-calf boots,\u201d Bailis says. \u201cAs far as accessories go, it\u2019s going to be a two-bag day: a tote with a water bottle, my Election Day worker\u2019s manual, a backup mask, some granola bars, and then my Lemaire mini Croissant bag, which is soft, and I can stuff into the tote to keep everything all together.\u201d", "The success of her Election Day outfit hinges on comfort and utility. \u201cI\u2019m going to be interacting with a lot of different people throughout the day; the idea is to keep the line moving and make sure everyone can vote,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving my outfit as a talking point is not the goal (for once).\u201d", "Helmut Lang cropped poplin long-sleeve shirt $415 $249 BERGDORF GOODMAN Shop Now Nili Lotan Angelina vest $495 NILI LOTAN Shop Now", "Uniqlo linen cotton relaxed shorts $20 UNIQLO Shop Now Cos fine turtleneck wool top $69 COS Shop Now", "Royal Jelly Harlem adult mask in black velvet w/ orange lining $39 ROYAL JELLY HARLEM Shop Now Sophie Buhai large Etruscan hoops $430 BIRD BROOKLYN Shop Now", "Legres knee-high leather boots $649 MATCHESFASHION.CON Shop Now Hydroflask 24 oz. standard mouth insulated bottle $35 MOOSEJAW Shop Now"], "authors": ["Alexis Bennett", "Alexis Bennet", "Alexandra Gurvitc"], "keywords": ["workers", "cotton", "bailis", "pair", "outfit", "election", "im", "day", "poll", "shes", "volunteering", "preparing", "shop", "worker"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
