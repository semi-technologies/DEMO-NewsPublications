Going on Air Force Two with his dad to China and getting off of Air Force Two and meeting with Chinese government officials and Communist Party officials and banks and investment firms owned or operated by the Chinese Communist Party and then entering into an investment partnership twelve days later with a member of Burisma, owned and operated by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch board member meets with Joe Biden in the White House. Two days later, Hunter Biden is put on the board of Burisma and is given an $83,000-a-month salary. No background in the Ukraine, no background in energy. It just stinks to high heaven. And I think that Joe Biden is going to be subject to blackmail if we don't get to the bottom of this. And so if he does become president, I think it's very important that we have an independent counsel looking into this."], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["blackmail", "member", "biden", "owned", "buck", "hunter", "looking", "subject", "operated", "officials", "party", "rep", "later", "joe", "ken", "think"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
