Their research into the holiday-gifting market led them to studies from Stanford University, the Nikela organization, and other eco-minded charities and sites with data that could make your head spin\u2014the total value of wasted product, according to some, is in the billions of dollars. Whether or not that number is accurate, the sentiment certainly stands true: Each holiday we receive plenty of stuff that we don\u2019t need. Not only is it financially wasteful, but it has hazardous implications for the environment.", "\u201cWe often get a letter or a Christmas card from a friend or from a company that says [we made a donation] in your name. You put that card away and that\u2019s it,\u201d says van Lamsweerde. \u201cWe thought, How can we make this more meaningful? How can we have it make a more lasting effect for the person that\u2019s receiving that notice? And also how can we encourage charitable gifts to happen more often because there is something exciting attached to it?\u201d The couple\u2019s answer was, of course, in art.", "On December 14, the photographers will officially launch Double Dutch, a cash-giving app. The idea came to the photographers more than a year ago, but the pandemic accelerated Double Dutch\u2019s progress from idle thought into reality. The premise is simple: Upon launch, users will be able to donate to charities like Knot on my Planet, Every Mother Counts, Parley for the Oceans, and the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund directly on the platform and make those donations in a friend\u2019s name. Each donation will be accompanied by a $2 card, of which $1 goes to Double Dutch and $1 goes to the artist who designed the card. Users will be able to save the cards on their virtual wall in the app and share them across social media.", "Incentivizing participation is the list of creatives on board, which reads like a rundown of the art world\u2019s most influential people. Sterling Ruby, William Wegman, Urs Fischer, Marilyn Minter, Maurizio Cattelan, and Es Devlin are just some of those offering work on the platform alongside more unexpected and emerging names like Gigi Hadid, Langley Fox, and Tyson Johnson. \u201cWe have access to all these incredible artists because we\u2019re offering a digital version of the brilliant work that these people are making, and it makes it much, much more attainable,\u201d says van Lamsweerde, noting that being able to include younger talents was just as important to the duo as collaborating with their friends and peers. \u201cGigi Hadid, she reached out and said, \u2018How can I help? What can I do?\u2019 She made two exclusive cards for us, and the same with Sterling Ruby, with Andr\u00e9 Saraiva, and there are more and more people who have reached out to us asking what we need.\u201d Even better, many of the established artists participating will be donating the profits from the sale of their virtual works to Double Dutch\u2019s charities.", "The goal is that Double Dutch can offer a virtual way to collect art while giving back. In this, it\u2019s sort of an extension of the many mutual-aid print sales that have taken place throughout 2020. \u201cWe have been a part of a few of those print sales, which I think are brilliant, over this whole COVID period,\u201d says Matadin, \u201cbut for us, it\u2019s really about zero waste.\u201d", "\u201cThat is what has been a kind of revelation in this time of COVID: that we\u2019re all realizing we don\u2019t need that much,\u201d van Lamsweerde says. \u201cWe actually need to eat and need to stay healthy and warm\u2014all the other stuff is really extra. It has also brought to our attention how many people are in need and don\u2019t have those basic needs met, as well as how many incredible organizations there are that are helping on every different level. Being able to help without creating more waste is a very, very big deal for us.\u201d", "Van Lamsweerde and Matadin are launching the app with Laura Bailyn, the founder of Kidfund, and Piyusha Eluri, and powering it with Adyen, a global payment method with design by KesselsKramer. The idea is that beyond 2020, Double Dutch can launch person-to-person transactions alongside charitable donations, meaning you could potentially send a friend $25 for a dinner alongside a Cindy Sherman artwork.", "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping it becomes a medium for giving for any occasion, for any reason, even if it\u2019s just to say \u2018I love you\u2019 or \u2018I miss you, and in your name, I\u2019ve donated $5 to Parley for the Oceans,\u2019\u201d van Lamsweerde says. \u201cIt can be a gift of $2 or a gift of $50; it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s purely about communicating how much you love each other, or that you\u2019re thinking of each other, and that there is this incredible organization that is benefiting from your love.\u201d"], "authors": ["Steff Yotka", "Steff Yotk"], "keywords": ["holidays", "able", "giving", "double", "lamsweerde", "dutch", "virtual", "need", "van", "inez", "love", "vinoodh", "launch", "card", "platform"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
