Four years later, with the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr., the divides that have long simmered among Democrats are now beginning to burst into the open, as the president-elect confronts deep generational and ideological differences among congressional lawmakers, activists and the party\u2019s grass-roots base.", "The fault lines began to emerge within hours of Mr. Biden\u2019s victory.

Beyond that, they said that a disappointing showing by Democrats in congressional races \u2014 the party lost seats in the House and faces a struggle for even narrow control of the Senate \u2014 would give liberal Democrats less of a platform to push Mr. Biden to the left."], "authors": ["Astead W.
