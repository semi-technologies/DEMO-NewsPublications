The young congregants\u2014our church was popular with local university students\u2014played guitars, gave testimonials, raised their hands in rhapsody, and \u201cdanced with the spirit\u201d in the aisles. Sometimes, though not often, people spoke in tongues, a diabolical glossolalia that I found deeply fascinating. There was a church band\u2014twelve-string guitars, tambourines, trumpet, and flute. We sang American hymns, songs I vaguely thought of as \u201cCalifornian.\u201d I grew to dread one of the most popular, \u201cI Am the Bread of Life,\u201d which had a chorus with the words \u201cAnd I will raise him up.\u201d As the chorus soared, earnest hands were raised heavenward\u2014including the hands of my parents, who were always moved by this song to forgo their customary physical reticence. I would glance sideways at them and then quickly look away, as if I\u2019d witnessed the throes of some primal scene.", "The extremity of emotion that pulsed through the congregation every Sunday alarmed me. I came to think of that church as the place where grownups weep. Charismatic or evangelical churches are theatres of spiritual catharsis. You come to such places and lay your burdens before the Lord, open your soul to the Holy Spirit, and \u201clet all the sadness and evil out\u201d (as my mother once put it). This crisis of transformation was often physically arduous. People shuddered and their eyes filled with tears, while others who had already been through such experiences held their hands or prayed over them. \u201cFree prayer\u201d was encouraged; worshippers might blurt out their hopes, secrets, prophecies. The natural order of things was inverted: adults, spasming in emotion, appeared to need the calm intervention of the dry-eyed child. This was where perfectly ordinary English people seemed to lead a kind of double life, an existence that, in its strange abandon and abnormality, appeared almost criminally intense.", "What was unsettling to the child, in other words, was probably what was so exciting to the adult convert: the drama of transferred authority. The believing adult, pulled toward the commanding Christ, felt the divine power of God\u2019s call, and the divinely inspired power of the pastors and the elders who voiced that call: You must change your life. But the unbelieving or skeptical child, with no great desire to change his life, felt abandoned by those who should have been in charge, and wondered furtively at the authority of that divine command. Who was this God, this Jesus, this Holy Spirit? If he didn\u2019t exist, then Sunday morning was a mass sickness, nothing more than the contagion of hallucination. That prospect seemed quite troubling. But the alternative scenario didn\u2019t seem any better. Evangelical practice presumes a highly interventionist Jesus, a surveillance God who not only numbers the hairs on your head but cares about your job interview, whom you go out with, the house you want to buy. When my mother told the pastor that I had done well in a recent school exam, he gave me a hug and offered a hearty \u201cPraise the Lord!\u201d I thought that this God probably didn\u2019t exist, but, if he did exist, he had all the scrutinizing powers of a meddlesome headmaster, always alert for the smallest failures and successes.", "I know how unbalanced this is. I\u2019m sure I should have seen all the human goodness and decency\u2014there was plenty of that around, too. I bring it up as a way of explaining my somewhat unbalanced interest in the work of the Stanford anthropologist T. M. Luhrmann, who has been studying American evangelical worship for at least twenty years. In 2012, Luhrmann published \u201cWhen God Talks Back,\u201d an account of her experiences in charismatic churches in Chicago and the San Francisco area. These were part of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship, a network of congregations founded in California in the nineteen-seventies. Curious about everything, open-eyed, endlessly patient, Luhrmann embedded herself like a military correspondent. Over several years, she interviewed more than fifty congregants, worshipped and prayed with them, joined Bible-study groups, and reported, with scrupulous neutrality, on their daily spiritual practice.", "Her new book, \u201cHow God Becomes Real\u201d (Princeton), represents a distillation of that deep work on American Evangelicalism, and expands her acute discussion of spiritual practice across other forms of religious devotion that she has studied or encountered over the years\u2014charismatic Christian worship in Ghana and India, Santer\u00eda (\u201ca blend of Yoruba spirit possession and Catholicism that emerged among West African slaves in the Caribbean\u201d), and British witchcraft (Luhrmann\u2019s first book, \u201cPersuasions of the Witch\u2019s Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England,\u201d from 1989, was the product of field work among apparently ordinary Londoners who practiced magic and witchcraft).", "This comparative framework suits Luhrmann, precisely because she is not interested in the questions that so gripped me when I was young: what or who is God, and how can we know if this God exists? Luhrmann passes over questions of belief in search of questions of practice\u2014the technologies of prayer. She wants to know how worshippers open themselves up to their experiences of God; how they communicate with gods and spirits and in turn hear those gods and spirits reply to them, and she is interested in the kind of therapeutic transformation that such prayerful conversation has on the worshipper. She calls this activity \u201creal-making,\u201d and adds that her new book is not a believer\u2019s or an atheist\u2019s, but an anthropologist\u2019s work. \u201cRather than presuming that people worship because they believe, we ask instead whether people believe because they worship,\u201d she writes. Thus \u201cthe puzzle of religion,\u201d as she defines it, \u201cis not the problem of false belief but the question of how gods and spirits become and remain real to people and what this real-making does for humans.\u201d Whether these questions\u2014of belief and of practice\u2014can be separated quite as staunchly as she wishes is the \u201cpuzzle\u201d that surely haunts her own work.", "Readers without firsthand experience of evangelical communities were probably surprised by some of the day-to-day details in \u201cWhen God Talks Back.\u201d Luhrmann describes, at the Vineyard churches, a relationship with God of casual and remarkably friendly intimacy. She prepares us by cautioning that her evangelical subjects approach God in a way that, to traditional believers, might seem \u201cvulgar, overemotional, or even psychotic.\u201d Among her interviewees, Elaine prays for guidance about whether to take a roommate or move to a new apartment. Kate gets angry with God and \u201cyells at him when things go wrong\u2014when she organizes a trip for the church and the bus company is flaky or it rains.\u201d Stacy prays for a good haircut, and Hannah asks God about whom to date, and sometimes feels he is pranking her in little ways: \u201cI\u2019ll trip and fall, and I\u2019ll be like, Thanks, God.\u201d Rachel asks for help with how to dress: \u201cLike, God, what should I wear? . . . I think God cares about really, really little things in my life.\u201d Other women speak of setting an evening aside for a \u201cdate night\u201d with the Lord (men speak of \u201cquiet time\u201d with God, Luhrmann reports). They are perhaps encouraged in this thinking by their pastor, who suggests that his congregants should \u201cset out a second cup of coffee for God in the morning\u2014to pour God an actual cup of steaming coffee, to place it on an actual table, and to sit down at that table . . . to talk to God about the things on our minds.\u201d", "These believers speak to their creator, and hear him speak to them. Generally, God\u2019s voice is not audible, and \u201cGod\u201d is merely the mental attribution of what a voiced divine reply would be like. But sometimes Luhrmann\u2019s subjects attest to having heard an actual voice. Elaine, who is one of Luhrmann\u2019s principal witnesses and the leader of the Bible-study group she joins, tells her that she was praying when she heard the Lord clearly say the words \u201cStart a school.\u201d But what believers hear, Luhrmann discovers, depends on where they\u2019re from. In her new book, she finds that in India and Ghana God seems to speak more audibly than in America: \u201cPeople reported experiencing God talking more palpably, as if He spoke from outside their inner mind, than He did in the United States.\u201d She thinks that a culture of skepticism\u2014and perhaps an embarrassment about appearing weird or insane\u2014prompts American worshippers to be somewhat suspicious of such audibility.", "Luhrmann emphasizes that one needs a talent for this kind of highly attuned prayer. She notices how hard her subjects work at their relationships with God. Hearing God\u2019s voice, she says, is a \u201crichly layered skill,\u201d and her subjects speak of developing it as one would speak of any expertise; they think that \u201crepeated exposure and attention, coupled with specific training, helps the expert to see things that are really present but that the raw observer just cannot.\u201d At various moments, Luhrmann likens the way her congregants view this aptitude for prayerful communication to wine tasting, being a sonogram technician, playing tennis. The Vineyard members talk to her about the importance of \u201cdiscernment,\u201d a word that Paul uses in I Corinthians, where he lists various \u201cgifts\u201d of the Spirit\u2014the powers of prophecy, of healing, of speaking in tongues, and the \u201cdiscerning of spirits.\u201d I remember how important that talismanic phrase \u201cgifts of the Spirit\u201d was in our congregation, because it distinguished those churches fortunate enough to be in possession of such charismatic powers.", "Luhrmann tells us that no one at the Vineyard laid out any rules of discernment, but that when she asked people how they knew that God was speaking to them they would revert to four \u201ctests.\u201d First, did a suggestion seem spontaneous, unlikely, not the kind of thing you would normally say or imagine? Second, was what you were hearing the kind of thing God might say, and not in contradiction to Biblical example or teaching? (Luhrmann stresses that the Vineyard\u2019s God is not the severe God of the Hebrew Bible\u2014who, for instance, orders Abraham to kill his son\u2014but the loving God of the New Testament.) Third, could the revelation be verified by asking other people who were praying for the same outcome whether they had heard a similar message? Fourth, did hearing God\u2019s voice impart a sense of peace? \u201cIf what you heard (or saw) did not, it did not come from God.\u201d", "I have a flyer from the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses that asks \u201cCan We Really Believe What the Bible Says?\u201d and lists three reasons for doing so, the third of which is \u201cGod cannot lie. The Bible plainly states: \u2018It is impossible for God to lie.\u2019 (Hebrews 6:18).\u201d Below this, a friend of mine has written, in pen, \u201cQ.E.D.\u201d The four tests of the Vineyard are beset by a similar circularity, and, in fairness, it\u2019s not clear how any so-called theological test could escape it. The evangelical relationship to God is so possessive, and so near-idolatrous, that it\u2019s hard to see how one could get outside it and manage the necessary \u201cverification.\u201d Idolatrous, because conceiving a God who is interested in what shirt you wear can look a lot like inventing a God for your own small purposes. Again and again, evangelical worshippers seem to use God to validate the great luxury of capitalism: choice. Should I choose Denver or Chicago? This job or that job? That boyfriend or not? (The usual formulation for validating your decision is \u201cI feel God calling me to do x.\u201d)", "\u201cI\u2019m buying some back-to-office clothes.\u201d Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", "Shopping Cartoon by Amy Hwang", "There\u2019s a story that the lovable German poet (and convert from Judaism) Heinrich Heine, lying on his deathbed in 1856, calmly uttered these final words about God\u2019s forgiveness: \u201cHe\u2019ll forgive me; that\u2019s his job.\u201d Heine, one imagines, was making fun of the whole contraption of last-minute bargains; more subtly, he was mocking the idea that we control God, that we know what tricks this little brass effigy we have fabricated in our own image will perform on our behalf. Evangelicals are very good at knowing what God\u2019s job is. Heine sounds like Ludwig Feuerbach, who proposed, fifteen years before Heine\u2019s death, in \u201cThe Essence of Christianity,\u201d that we make the God we need, projecting onto this creation our deepest anxieties and desires.", "Modern Christians in the West like to think of themselves as believers who have left behind any cultic relationship with a usable God. Doubtless not a few of them harbor a special disdain for American Evangelicalism, with its gaudy, prosperous instrumentalism. Certainly, if belief were plotted along a spectrum, at one end might lie the austere indescribability of the Jewish or Islamic God (\u201cSilence is prayer to thee,\u201d Maimonides wrote) and at the other the noisy, all-too-knowable God of charismatic worship, happy to be chatted to and apparently happy to chat back. But it is still a spectrum, and, indeed, any kind of petitionary prayer presumes a God onto whom one is projecting local human attributes. In this sense, you could say that Christianity is essentially a form of idolatry. The difficult, unspeakable Jewish God becomes the incarnated Jesus, a God made flesh, who lived among us, who resembles us. Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer blamed Christian anti-Semitism on just this idolatry of the man-God: \u201cChrist the incarnated spirit is the deified sorcerer.\u201d They called this \u201cthe spiritualization of magic.\u201d Evangelicals are hardly the only Christian believers to draw this Jesus, the deified sorcerer, near to them. I\u2019m reminded of that whenever I see professional soccer players crossing themselves as they run onto the field, as if God really cared whether Arsenal beats Manchester United.", "Luhrmann would say, with some justice, that in such cases we should focus more on the practice than on the beliefs. Crossing oneself is ritualistic, and she would probably add that the soccer player then performs on the field as if he and his team alone determined the outcome of the game, which is to say that\u2014in a sense\u2014he performs as if God didn\u2019t exist after all. In \u201cHow God Becomes Real,\u201d Luhrmann calls this the art of possessing \u201cflexible ontologies,\u201d because \u201cpeople may talk as if the gods are straightforwardly real, but they don\u2019t act that way.\u201d A driver who prays that the car will stop without his using the brakes \u201cwould seem mad, not devout.\u201d The real world, dependent on the laws of physics, runs easily alongside a highly elaborated and imagined belief-world, which shares several of the properties of fiction-making and fiction-reading. The Vineyard believers, Luhrmann discovered, learn how to \u201cpretend that God is present and to make believe that he is talking back like the very best of buddies.\u201d As with a fictional character, this God is at once absolutely real and not quite real. Luhrmann likens the capacity for imaginative absorption to being \u201cengrossed in good magical fiction of the Harry Potter kind.\u201d One of the spiritual guidebooks she consults suggests that worshippers relate to God not as an \u201cAuthor,\u201d a view that will make you \u201cgo mad or despair,\u201d but as a \u201ccharacter.\u201d As she notes, this move effectively abolishes heresy and doubt, by personalizing God\u2019s authority. The \u201cquestion of evil,\u201d the ancient dilemma that has driven people to madness or despair\u2014why is the world beset by tragedy if a providential and loving Author created it?\u2014becomes a much easier therapeutic question: why is my life the way it is, and how can Jesus help me to make it better? Luhrmann neglects to say that the interventionist evangelical God ought to make the believer feel the problem of evil all the more acutely, since a deity mundane enough to have an interest in the outcome of a job interview might also be presumed to have had some role to play during, say, the Holocaust.", "Luhrmann has brilliantly illuminated the magical attunement that constitutes a great deal of evangelical charismatic belief. Yet her work, at least to the religious skeptic, also carries with it an almost unbearable tension. She is, for the most part, carefully neutral about the existence of God, or even somewhat hospitable to the notion. When she talks about the playful or pretend elements of charismatic belief, she reminds her readers that of course it isn\u2019t just pretend, that these worshippers are making \u201ca real claim about the nature of the world, a claim about the objective reality of the Holy Spirit and God\u2019s supernatural presence.\u201d In \u201cHow God Becomes Real,\u201d when she emphasizes how much training and technique go into spiritual absorption and prayerful communication, she concedes that such an argument might seem to \u201cexplain gods and spirits away, as if the experience of a god were nothing more than a temperamental byproduct.\u201d That\u2019s not what she thinks, she quickly adds, though without telling us why she doesn\u2019t think so. At other moments, she seems to have done a bit of \u201creal-making\u201d of her own\u2014having apparently been so deeply embedded in Elaine\u2019s prayer group that \u201cI was her prayer partner in house group, and week after week we prayed for specific upcoming job interviews\u201d for Elaine.", "We aren\u2019t told who or what Luhrmann was praying to. My surmise is that she isn\u2019t sure (a perfectly respectable position), which explains how often her analysis, at the very brink of deciding, as it were, which way to vote, engages in curious slippages of argument. Her major refuge is a kind of therapeutic pragmatism. She\u2019s fond of the verb \u201cwork.\u201d Prayer works, belief works, real-making works, she says, in the sense that, as far as these believers are concerned, God is made real; and these prayer practices therapeutically change the people who practice them. But does prayer \u201cwork\u201d in the most important sense, of achieving what it proposes\u2014which is to communicate with an actually existing God? Luhrmann won\u2019t be drawn out, committed as she is to a kind of Feuerbachian religious anthropology, in which God is merely the reality we conjure and create through our activities, imaginings, and yearnings.", "\u201cThese practices work,\u201d she writes at the start of \u201cWhen God Talks Back.\u201d \u201cThey change people. That is, they change mental experience, and those changes help people to experience God as more real.\u201d A page later, she writes that the most difficult problem that faces \u201canyone who believes or wants to believe in God\u201d is \u201cnot whether God exists, in some abstract, in-principle, out-in-the-universe way, but how to find God in the everyday world and how to know that what you have found is God, and not someone else\u2019s deluded fantasy or your own selfish wish.\u201d This sounds like a reasonable caveat, but it\u2019s something of a fudge. Can the practice of finding God be so easily separated from the crucial question of whether there is a God to find? Presumably, once you are convinced that the God you have found is not a \u201cdeluded fantasy,\u201d you also believe that God exists, both as an abstract proposition and as an actual presence.", "Luhrmann ends \u201cWhen God Talks Back\u201d by telling us that she doesn\u2019t \u201cpresume to know ultimate reality\u201d but does feel that she has \u201ccome to know God.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t call herself a Christian, but finds herself defending Christianity. (Luhrmann was brought up as a Unitarian\u2014a denomination that most evangelicals would consider essentially godless.) At the end of \u201cHow God Becomes Real,\u201d she announces that she doesn\u2019t believe that God exists, if by God one means \u201can invisible other somehow out there, sitting apart, a man with a beard in the sky.\u201d On the other hand, she finds it \u201cuncomfortable to characterize what one might call believers as having false beliefs.\u201d Instead, she finds herself caught in the middle\u2014between discounting the idea of God as something equally real and present in the world as \u201ctable and chairs\u201d and discounting the words of the believers she has interviewed as \u201cmere metaphors\u201d (which would seem as if she were judging their beliefs as false)."], "authors": ["James Wood", "James Woo"], "keywords": ["say", "does", "believers", "god", "gods", "knowing", "prayer", "luhrmann", "real", "practice", "work", "evangelical", "kind"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
