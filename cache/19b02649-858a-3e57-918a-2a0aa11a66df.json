I believe it\u2019s an Australian invention. If you go to Italy and ask for a latte they give you boiled milk.", "'It\u2019s got a lot of sweat in it': Reg Mombassa on his three most useful objects Read more", "I was a bit sceptical of home coffee machines but I got a Nespresso machine 12 years ago. Normally I would have a coffee as I\u2019m travelling around the place, but I find the machine is very dependable. I like my latte at home now more than I do when I\u2019m in the office, when I go across the road to buy one.", "Coffee just gives you a pep, it gives you a lift at a time when your energy\u2019s flagging. And, as you know, staying home can lead to feeling less stimulated and less motivated \u2013 so it\u2019s really important to have this uplift.", "A velvet top", "Particularly for Zoom, I\u2019ve had so many compliments recently. People have said: \u201cYou look wonderful, you look well.\u201d Little do they know my secret is my velvet top and comfortable pants. I made this for myself especially for staying home because it\u2019s really important to have a garment you feel good in.", "Being at home requires a totally different way of dressing. You\u2019re sitting around, you might drop coffee or a piece of toast on yourself. So what you wear has to be easily washable to be kept fresh, that way you can wear it everyday \u2013 and wash it overnight for the next meeting.", "I wanted something that was comfortable and yet looked good, was sleek, was feminine \u2013 all the things that you need when you\u2019re sitting on a couch looking at an iPad and talking to other people. You don\u2019t want to have fussy sleeves. What I made turned out to be flattering as well.", "Eventually I got so many compliments that I said to the office, \u201cWe really should make this.\u201d So we did.", "", "That being said, I am looking forward to wearing lots of different things when Covid is over. I remember being pregnant and wearing pregnancy clothes, and I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of them. I will be happy to get into something restrictive.", "Face cream", "I\u2019ve been enjoying lavishing cream all over my face. Because I\u2019m not wearing makeup, I\u2019ve been applying it two or three times a day. I normally don\u2019t have this much time to look after myself so it\u2019s been really magical. I go to the office about six hours a week and the rest of the time I\u2019m at home. I haven\u2019t wanted to interact too much with the office, because you never know. It\u2019s a crazy situation that we\u2019re in.", "'It\u2019s literally the perfect knife': Dan Hong on the three most useful objects in his life Read more", "I think if you look good, you feel better. At least it cheers you up, you look in the mirror and think, \u201cThat looks pretty wonderful.\u201d I\u2019ve also been swimming every day and the more you flip around the more energy you get. After a cold swim you\u2019re invigorated, so you run to a bath with really hot water. It\u2019s so good for your circulation \u2013 getting very cold and then getting very hot. Putting face cream on and coming out of the bathroom, flushing red like a baby.", "For me, Le Mer skin cream is enough. I\u2019ve been using it since it was first brought out in Australia. It keeps my skin at a level that I like \u2013 healthy at my old age. I think that, combined with swimming, must be the reason people are complimenting me.", "I like to look at the bright side of things.
