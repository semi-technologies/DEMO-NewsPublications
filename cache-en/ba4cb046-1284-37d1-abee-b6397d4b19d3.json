One health policy expert described it as a textbook strategy to subdue the second wave.", "But it is now clear that this year\u2019s festive season will be like no other, a German Christmas stripped of its famous traditions. No mulled wine with colleagues at a Christmas market, no carols in packed churches on the afternoon of 24 December, and no large family reunions in the evening.", "The economy minister has even urged the public to forego presents under the Christmas tree this year and to make do with vouchers instead. On New Year\u2019s Eve, there will be no collective unleashing of fireworks and crackers. Instead, the country is bracing itself for a silent night more quiet than usual, by government decree.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Signs in Munich ordering mask use and banning alcohol.

On Sunday, the country\u2019s disease control agency recorded 16,362 new Covid-19 infections and 188 new deaths, the highest figures reported for a Sunday in both categories.", "So Germany has had to reach again for the bluntest hammer in the toolbox. Not only hairdressers and non-essential shops but also schools and nurseries will close from Wednesday until 10 January. Family gatherings will be allowed between 24 and 26 December, but restricted to no more than four guests over the age of 14.", "The sale of fireworks and firecrackers in the run-up to New Year\u2019s Eve will be banned, though firing off pyrotechnics is technically still allowed.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest People queue in front of a shop in Frankfurt.

Our highest goal has to be to bring down infection rates as quickly as possible. That\u2019s something that can only be achieved by radically reducing contacts and encounters.\u201d", "The lockdown news, which came after a one-hour summit rather than the prolonged negotiations seen in recent months over local opt-outs, was met with a sigh of relief by some.", "\u201cOne had given up expecting this level of sanity from the state premiers in their wrestling match with the chancellor,\u201d wrote the left-leaning broadsheet taz. \u201cFor weeks there has only been hesitation and quarrelling while coronavirus numbers rose and more and more people with lung problems on intensive care stations ran out of air to breathe. No one wanted to be the messenger of the bad news: lockdown over Christmas.\u201d", "In a country as decentralised as Germany, where key pandemic policy areas such as health and education are within the remit of the 16 federal states rather than Berlin, the blame game is not easily played.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest A mulled wine stand at a Christmas market in Berlin. Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters", "Die Welt commented that the hard lockdown was also the result of scientific models that had failed to take into account the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d: a gut feeling created by the relative mild first wave, that Covid-19 posed less of a lethal threat than expected.", "\u201cCurrently, in the middle of a genuinely threatening outbreak where some hospitals have stopped taking in patients, the number of people who feel endangered is significantly lower than in March when the virus first came to Germany,\u201d the newspaper said. \u201cEven though the risk of being infected in public has increased about a hundredfold since March, most people perceive it to be as high as it was then.\u201d", "The Munich-based broadsheet S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung criticised Angela Merkel\u2019s government for coming across as surprisingly unprepared for a second wave it had spent much of the year warning about. Local health authorities should have been boosted with additional staff and funding after the spring, wrote its Berlin correspondent, Stefan Braun.", "The leaders of the federal states, meanwhile, should have worked harder to overcome their differences and worked out a joint concepts for schools, he said. \u201cIn this crisis, federalism hasn\u2019t shown its strengths but some fatal weaknesses.\u201d", "Ordinary citizens, too, needed to question the role they played in bringing about the Christmas lockdown, Braun wrote. \u201cThose who are honest with themselves all know these moments of defiance, ignorance and exhaustion that lead one to go on this or that Christmas shopping trip even though the shops were full. And we all know those little rebellious moments in which we decided to meet up with our friends one more time to enjoy a soup or a mulled wine because it felt like balm to the soul.\u201d"], "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "keywords": ["germany", "night", "fails", "braces", "wave", "health", "twitter", "wrote", "lockdown", "silent", "public", "soft", "wine", "christmas", "result"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
