America Inc rushed to announce plans to tackle racial inequality. Walmart said it would set up a $100m initiative to fight racism. Pepsi vowed to double spending with black-owned suppliers. Facebook and Est\u00e9e Lauder pledged to hire more non-white candidates. JPMorgan Chase promised to extend $30bn in loans over five years to minority households and businesses. Even NASCAR , which runs a motor-racing series for a mostly rural and white fan base, prohibited the display of confederate flags at its events. Diversity, many said, is not just the right thing to do. It is good for business.", "For one breed of firms it has been very good indeed. Consultancies and recruiters are enjoying a mini-boom as companies look for advice on how to become more inclusive. The newly created diversity, equity and inclusion ( DEI ) practice at Bain, a consultancy, now has two dozen staff, and another two dozen want to be part of it at least some of the time, says Julie Coffman, who heads it. She calls diversity \u201cthe next digital\u201d. A partner at another consultancy says DEI is the \u201cfastest growing business line we have right now\u201d. Lyndon Taylor, who leads DEI at Heidrick and Struggles, an executive-search firm, discerns a \u201cquantum\u201d jump in demand for such services.", "Lots of companies promised to do things during the protests. Now, Mr Taylor says, they must work out what those are and how they are going to do them. The priority is hiring black senior executives or board members. Before 2020 diversity meant women, Latino, Asian and LGBTQ , says Dale Jones, boss of the Diversified Search Group, a 46-year-old recruitment firm originally set up to promote women. Now Mr Jones sees \u201ca hyper focus around black leadership\u201d, with board placements up by half and C -suite recruiting by around a third over the past year.", "Julie Hembrock Daum, who recruits board members at Spencer Stuart, another search firm, says she has to temper clients\u2019 expectations about what is possible. She tells them to think long and hard about what qualities they need on their board rather than \u201ca knee-jerk reaction like \u2018we need a CEO who is black\u2019\u201d.", "Recruiters remind clients that boardrooms and C -suites are not overly blessed with other ethnic minorities, LGBTQ people or women. They also highlight other underrepresented groups, such as veterans, migrants and refugees, the \u201cdifferently abled\u201d and the all-encompassing \u201ccognitively diverse\u201d (consultant-speak for people who think differently).", "The diversity industry has expanded beyond finding new hires. Consultancies\u2019 and recruiters\u2019 services include training staff on bias, advice for diversifying supply chains and coaching senior executives on how to run more inclusive firms. Some offer broad-ranging strategies for organisational and managerial changes. As one recruiter puts it, \u201chiring can be a quick fix, but you can\u2019t just add a couple of diverse fish. You actually need to change the water in the pond.\u201d", "Demand for such services is unlikely to abate any time soon. A survey by Edelman, a public-relations firm, conducted soon after news of Floyd\u2019s death, found that 60% of respondents said a brand\u2019s reaction to the protests \u201cwill influence whether I buy or boycott them in the future\u201d. Younger customers and employees are likelier to hold strong views: 53% of those aged 18-34 said they would not work for a firm that failed to speak out during the protests, compared with 42% for all ages."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["fuelled", "need", "diversity", "firm", "think", "boom", "unrest", "board", "work", "protests", "dei", "women", "black", "industry", "social", "inclusive"], "pubDate": "2020-11-28T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
