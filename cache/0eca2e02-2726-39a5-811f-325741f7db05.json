The first woman\u2014does it need to be said?\u2014to be elected to the White House, she was wearing a sleek pants suit, suffragette white. Pearl earrings. A radiant smile. She was there as the first welcome harbinger of the post-Trump era, the return to sanity, the sensible resolution to a years-long mad-king play. But Harris had a message that was greater even than this remarkable moment. \u201cI am thinking about . . . the generations of women, Black women,\u201d she said, pausing while the crowd whooped. \u201cAsian, white, Latina, Native American women, who throughout our nation\u2019s history have paved the way for this moment tonight. Women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality and liberty and justice for all\u2014including the Black women who are often, too often, overlooked, but so often prove they are the backbone of our democracy.\u201d She went on to praise President-elect Joe Biden, who, she said, \u201chad the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his Vice-President.\u201d", "History was made. The memes and TikToks flew: Harris striding, in heels; Harris descending onto the tarmac; Harris as Wonder Woman. One mom-spirational slogan in particular unleashed a stream of heart-eye emojis in group texts throughout the land: \u201cMake sure to wear shoes, ladies. There\u2019s glass everywhere.\u201d Julia Louis-Dreyfus tweeted, \u201c \u2018Madam Vice President\u2019 is no longer a fictional character.\u201d", "So: exit the fembots of Trump\u2019s White House, with their long blond blowouts, cloned from an atom of Ivanka\u2019s tinted contact lens. Enter Harris, the woman from San Francisco\u2019s East Bay, who campaigned in Converse, who dances along to Cardi B. In her speech, she invoked her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher who came to California from Southern India at the age of nineteen, calling her \u201cthe woman most responsible for my presence here today.\u201d (Her father, Donald Harris, who was born in Jamaica, is an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford; he and Shyamala divorced when Kamala was young, and she was primarily raised by her mother.) Joining Harris on the stage were her husband, Doug Emhoff, whom she married in 2014, and his two children from a previous marriage; her sister Maya; her niece, Meena, whom she helped to raise; and Meena\u2019s young children. In 2019, when I was writing about Harris for a Profile in the magazine, Meena told me that, growing up, \u201cit was me, my grandma, my mom, and my aunt. I often joke that the opening scene of \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 the movie was what it was like to grow up in my house. It was female-centric, strong female-centric, with a huge emphasis on social justice and public service early on.\u201d", "Harris is fifty-six, a political meteor. Less than twenty years ago, she won her first election, as district attorney of San Francisco. She was the first woman and the first person of color to occupy that role. In 2010, she became the first woman and the first person of color to be elected attorney general in California. In 2016, she was elected to the United States Senate\u2014the second Black woman and the first South Asian woman to serve. \u201cPeople told her before she became A.G., \u2018There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to win this race, they\u2019re not ready for a woman,\u2019 \u201d Debbie Mesloh, a close friend and former adviser, told me recently. \u201cShe\u2019s always had such hard elections, and such easy re\u00eblections.\u201d In 2019, Harris told me, \u201cI\u2019ve always been involved with breaking barriers. And breaking barriers can be a painful process. I\u2019m never going to complain about it, \u2019cause it\u2019s worth it in the end, it\u2019s worth it in terms of what you can accomplish.\u201d", "Kamala Harris and Joe Biden address the nation after winning the 2020 election.", "Four years ago, on the night of her Senate election, Harris wrote a victory speech that presumed a Hillary Clinton win. She thought that she would be a soldier for the first female President of the United States. Mesloh, who has been with Harris on every Election Night but this year\u2019s, says that, as the returns rolled in, Harris was in shock. \u201cShe didn\u2019t believe it at first,\u201d Mesloh told me. \u201cObviously, it started to become more and more clear that Trump was going to win. She was so distraught.\u201d According to Mesloh, the celebration party turned mournful. \u201cFirst, she gathered the staff. People were crying. She decided to roll up her sleeves.\u201d In her memoir, Harris writes that she tore up her speech and wrote a new one, focussed on the task ahead. \u201cDo we retreat or do we fight?\u201d she asked then. \u201cI say we fight. And I intend to fight!\u201d A former prosecutor, she was a heavyweight on the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, and a formidable adversary to Trump\u2019s proxies. After just two years in the Senate, she announced that she was running for President.", "As a candidate for the Democratic nomination, Harris was, memorably, Biden\u2019s adversary, and she bristled when people suggested that she would be good for the role she now occupies, that it might not be \u201cher time\u201d to be President. But Biden has implied that he might be a one-term President by choice, someone who will draw upon his decades-long relationships on Capitol Hill in an attempt to unify and heal a divided country, and then pass the baton. His selection of Harris as his Veep was tantamount to an anointment\u2014she is going to be the Democratic Party. Mesloh said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to bring a real solid sense of serious ideas around criminal-justice reform. Racial justice. Bread-and-butter economic issues. No one\u2019s ever sat in those rooms with that type of authority she has\u2014biracial, a woman, raised by two immigrants, raised by a single mom.\u201d", "If Harris runs for President again in four years, it\u2019ll be almost as an incumbent. Her time, in many senses, begins now. Surely, her responsibilities do: even now, Biden and Harris are assembling a coronavirus-response task force, showing more leadership while in the wings than the sitting President and his V.P. have demonstrated. And, because she is making history, her time will never end. On Saturday, Harris concluded her remarks with a promise. \u201cWhile I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.\u201d", "Read More About the 2020 Election"], "authors": ["Dana Goodyear", "Dana Goodyea"], "keywords": ["president", "makes", "harris", "going", "history", "biden", "woman", "told", "women", "white", "mesloh", "election", "kamala"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
