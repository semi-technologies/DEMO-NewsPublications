Sorry, neighbors, if my hotboxing permeates into your apartment\u2014but it\u2019s the one thing keeping me sane right now! Over the past few months, I\u2019ve made it my mission to turn my micro Manhattan apartment into an oasis, and a big part of this has been upping my scent game. Sure, sight and sound are the go-to senses for transforming one\u2019s home, but smell plays just as crucial a role in affecting our emotions. And with tomorrow\u2019s Election Day consuming all of our minds, why not use every means necessary to reduce anxiety right now?", "Turns out, the right scents are proven to actually boost our moods, help us calm down, and relax. \u201cBreathing in the essential-oil vapor instantly changes our brain patterns and can help us feel calmer and more grounded,\u201d Hope Gillerman, an aromatherapist and author of Essential Oils Every Day: Rituals and Remedies for Healing, Happiness, and Beauty, told Vogue earlier this year. \u201cDistinct from medications, they are not a cure but a pathway into taking good care of ourselves.\u201d", "Wearing a soft, pleasing fragrance is another easy way to literally surround yourself with positivity. Maison d\u2019Etto\u2019s new perfume, Noisette, for instance, has notes of magnolia flowers, musk, and lavandin; the latter is a type of lavender oil that is especially known for its relaxing benefits. I\u2019ve been dousing myself in it before bed and, call it a placebo effect, but I\u2019ve been sleeping like a baby.", "As far as your home is concerned, the right candle or diffuser can also contribute to your more grounded wellbeing through smell. I\u2019m a bonafide candle hoarder, and while I typically gravitate towards woodier and spicer scents, I\u2019ve found myself lighting more soothing, calming scents lately. I recently discovered Byredo\u2019s Chai candle, which is a warm fusion of tea leaves, ginger, and birch tree; the scent is meant to evoke the smell of your grandmother\u2019s home, and what\u2019s more soothing and cozy than that? Diffusers are also an efficient way to have essential oils waft throughout your space\u2014like living in a spa, minus the fees.", "If all else fails, simply burning a stick of sage or a braid of sweetgrass\u2014my personal favorite\u2014is a classic move. Burning the natural plants instantly cleanses the room (and any negativity in it). Growing up around my Indigenous culture, burning sweetgrass was often used for ceremonial purposes or special occasions, but I find incorporating the sweet, smokey scent into my every day brings me unparalleled joy.", "Below, 14 more soothing scents to calm your nerves including candles, diffusers, fragrances, soaps, and more.", "Byredo Chai candle $85 BYREDO Shop Now Boy Smells Petal candle $32 STANDARD DOSE Shop Now", "Susanne Kaufmann De-stress Oil $41 BEAUTY HABITAT Shop Now Aveda Bergamot Essential oil + Base $18 AVEDA Shop Now", "Healing Solutions Eucalyptus Essential Oil $18 AMAZON Shop Now Orenda Tribe Navajo-Made Shim\u00e1 Earth gift box $40 ORENDA TRIBE Shop Now", "The Nue Co Functional fragrance $155 THE NUE CO Shop Now Maison d\u2019Etto Noisette fragrance $350 MAISON D\u2019ETTO Shop Now", "Bath & Body Works Aromatherapy Stress Relief Eucalyptus and Spearmint Body Wash $14 AMAZON Shop Now Aromatherapy Associates De-Stress Mind Rollerball $29 AROMATHERAPY ASSOCIATES Shop Now", "Vitruvi stone diffuser $119 VIOLET GREY Shop Now Jo Malone London lavender and musk diffuser $102 SAKS FIFTH AVENUE Shop Now"], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["14", "essential", "scent", "reduce", "oil", "ive", "soothing", "smell", "calming", "scents", "candle", "anxiety", "shop", "right", "election"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
