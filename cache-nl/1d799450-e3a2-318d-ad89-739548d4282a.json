The skitter of tiny feet on your laminate floor at night? Toothmarks in unexpected places? Hard cheese, you\u2019ve got mice.", "\u201cThere are a lot of them for the time of year,\u201d says Zeno Hoffmans, a consultant at pest control company De4 Nederland. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a cold winter with hard frosts, so everything simply stays alive \u2013 it\u2019s like having an autumn that goes on for four months. Also it\u2019s been quite rainy, and mice don\u2019t like wet weather: they\u2019ll creep in at ground level, and work their way up the building. When there\u2019s a wet autumn, that\u2019s when we get the biggest number of callouts.\u201d", "Once mice find enough to eat, they\u2019re unstoppable. \u201cA pair with an adequate food supply can produce 2,800 offspring in a year. They have six to twelve babies six times a year, and they all mate with their parents and siblings. It\u2019s like an inverted pyramid.\u201d", "Old-fashioned steel wool", "Some say the best way to get rid of mice is to stop them entering in the first place, by sealing cracks and other gaps with insulating foam. At least that\u2019s the theory.", "\u201cIt takes a mouse sixty seconds to gnaw through insulating foam,\u201d says Hoffmans. \u201cThey leave scent marks behind wherever they go, so it\u2019s potentially an open invitation to hundreds of other mice. A bit of foam isn\u2019t going to keep them away.\u201d", "Hoffmans recommends good old-fashioned steel wool. \u201cMice try to gnaw through it, but they don\u2019t like it because it cuts their gums. They\u2019ll try again the following night, and then they\u2019ll give up and go to your neighbours\u2019 place instead.\u201d", "Pencil", "If you do use steel wool, make sure you do a thorough job, because mice can creep through holes as small as half a centimetre. If a pencil fits, so will a mouse, so keeping them out completely is a virtually impossible task.", "", "Another tip: store food in hard plastic containers. If mice can munch their way through insulating foam, they\u2019ll make short work of a cardboard box. Don\u2019t leave crumbs lying around toasters and other appliances, put dirty dishes straight in the dishwasher, and vacuum regularly, particularly behind the stove and cupboards if you can, though that\u2019s obviously not possible if you have a fitted kitchen.", "Hoffmans says one classic problem is that plumbing can get dislodged when your dishwasher vibrates, creating a hole that lets mice in. You can buy a washer to cover this, but nine out of ten installers don\u2019t bother because the hole is hidden from view below the kitchen unit.", "The space behind your fridge is mouse paradise, too. \u201cThere\u2019s water for them to drink in the drip tray, the motor keeps the area nice and warm, and it\u2019s safe, the perfect place to build a nest.\u201d", "The only time the mice have to leave home is to search for food, and they require only three to five grammes a day, Hoffmans says. \u201cA single crumb is a meal when you\u2019re a mouse.\u201d", "Even the squeakiest of squeaky-clean kitchens may offer another food source for mice: that bowl of dog food on the floor. \u201cMice love pet food, it\u2019s nutritious to boot, and there\u2019s a reliable supply because it gets topped up every day or so.
