We must have picked up the virus there,\u201d she explains. \u201cI tested positive and then one by one my family went down with it.\u201d After a brief stint in hospital, Whiting has had symptoms ever since. \u201cI had the gastric version of the illness and have been wiped out with nausea, sickness and fatigue. It\u2019s only just starting to subside.\u201d", "Research shows that a fifth of people with Covid experience debilitating symptoms \u2013 including breathlessness, chest pain, coughing, fatigue, digestive problems and joint pain \u2013 five weeks after being infected. One in 10 still report problems after 12 weeks. This prolonged illness often comes as a shock to previously healthy people but for Whiting, feeling unwell wasn\u2019t new. \u201cI was diagnosed with a bladder condition called ulcerative interstitial cystitis two years ago after almost 20 years of ill-health,\u201d she says. Though the condition leaves her in severe pain, Whiting believes it made long Covid easier to cope with, and that other \u201clong-haulers\u201d could learn from the experiences of chronically ill people. \u201cI\u2019d already developed mechanisms for living with long-term illness, and while it\u2019s been challenging, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned to live with to enjoy my life.\u201d", "Whiting, who runs a jewellery design company, finds that creative groups and activities take her mind off the pain. \u201cBeing ill can make you feel like you\u2019re standing still when other people\u2019s lives are moving ahead,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is why it\u2019s important to always have something to look forward to. I like keeping my mind busy, so I am always booking online courses. Since lockdown began they\u2019ve really taken off, and I love that the digital world allows you to connect with people all over the world. It\u2019s made the world less lonely for disabled people.\u201d She enjoys working at her own pace. \u201cI get up early and often work really late, but I take lots of breaks during the day rather than working one long stint. You\u2019ve got to personalise your timetable.\u201d", "Farmer Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones has lived with graft-versus-host disease, a condition that causes severe dry eyes, skin problems, exhaustion and other symptoms, since having a stem cell transplant for leukaemia. He says that when you are unwell it is easy to feel as if you are on your own. \u201cFinding your tribe is really important. That could be a support group with people who suffer from the same condition as you, or it could be a group of people who share your interests. You need to find people you connect with.\u201d", "\u2018You need to find people you connect with\u2019 ... Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, who has graft-versus-host disease.

Emmanuel-Jones believes that, after the Covid-19 crisis, attitudes towards long-term illness in the workplace will change. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to own my own business, which I\u2019m really passionate about, because it means my time is my own and I can manage it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut lockdown has proved everyone can work flexibly, which people with chronic illness depend on. I would advise anyone to try to do something they love, where their needs can be accommodated.\u201d", "GP and breast cancer survivor Dr Jane Spurgeon is a clinical adviser trustee for Mission Remission, a charity that supports people who are recovering from cancer. She believes the Covid crisis has heightened awareness about long-term conditions. \u201cI am seeing a lot of people with long Covid who are struggling and often have managers who don\u2019t believe them. Many of the challenges are similar to those of people living with other chronic illnesses, like the effects of cancer treatment, ME and many others,\u201d she says. Fatigue is one of the biggest and most misunderstood challenges that people face. \u201cI recommend getting blood tests just in case other conditions, such as thyroid problems, might be causing it. Then it\u2019s a case of breaking things down into small, manageable goals. Sometimes walking around for just a few minutes might be a big achievement.\u201d", "During her cancer treatment, she didn\u2019t have the energy to go out and meet friends, but, in a post-Covid world, her patients can stay connected. \u201cA lot of people are enjoying Zoom conversations with friends, which weren\u2019t really happening before. Hopefully, this trend will continue.\u201d Spurgeon says complementary therapies such as reflexology and acupuncture can also be effective for some people. \u201cI always advise people to check with their doctor to make sure there are no risks to the therapy they want to try.\u201d She also suggests keeping journals to track progress, as well as food and sleep diaries to monitor what might make you feel better or worse.", "\u2018I\u2019ve adapted my sleep and nutrition and been able to come off pain medication\u2019 ... Lee Chambers, who was diagnosed with autoimmune arthritis. Photograph: provided by Lee Chambers", "It\u2019s a technique that worked for Lee Chambers, who was diagnosed with autoimmune arthritis six years ago. \u201cI went from being a busy dad to being unable to walk almost overnight. I went through feelings of anger and frustration and used the journal to document these, as well as my progress. When I had a setback, looking back at the journal really boosted my mood as it showed how far I had come.\u201d Since then he has worked hard to build a happy life that takes into account his condition, but doesn\u2019t revolve around it. He says he has become an experimenter, noting down how different curtains (blackout, for example), pyjamas, sleep times, foods and exercises affect him. \u201cI\u2019ve adapted my sleep and nutrition through trial and error and been able to come off pain medication,\u201d he says.", "Chambers\u2019 wife was pregnant with their second child when he became unwell. \u201cI learned to walk again alongside my baby daughter,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt sounds silly but I never thought about being able to walk before, but now it\u2019s something I\u2019m incredibly grateful for. Being ill made me re-evaluate what I wanted from life and what\u2019s important.\u201d He now adapts all activities to fit around his condition. \u201cIt\u2019s made me a more creative problem solver,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, I do Nordic-style walking with poles, which helps to take strain off my knees and means I can walk longer distances. I also coach disability football, as well as offering wellbeing support to others.\u201d", "Doing what you can, rather than focusing on what you can\u2019t, has been an important mantra for Helen Roper, who was born with cystic fibrosis. \u201cI love music and I\u2019ve taken my mobility scooter with me to festivals. Initially, I was worried about looking disabled but it gives me so much freedom. I use a portable oxygen concentrator, which I can travel with, as well as a non-invasive ventilator to sleep with. I\u2019ve even taken my ventilator to go camping in the Sahara.\u201d", "Structure is crucial for Roper, who incorporates plenty of naps into her timetable. \u201cWhen I plan a trip, like going to a wedding, I\u2019ll plan in the times I can go to our room and take a rest. I try to get a bit of spontaneity in our lives when we can \u2013 maybe an impromptu at-home disco with my boyfriend when I am having a good day.\u201d", "I do \u2018laughter yoga\u2019, which is based on the idea that your body benefits from laughing even when we pretend to laugh Helen Roper", "Since her health deteriorated four years ago and she was put on the waiting list for a double lung transplant, life has been quieter. \u201cLockdown hasn\u2019t been too different for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI spend a lot of time with my dog, which has been a life-saver. I\u2019ve met so many people as a result of taking her out, and playing with her is a great mindful activity. I think they should have animals on prescription.\u201d In the summer she took a trip to Alton Towers to escape isolation. \u201cWhen my doctor asked how I could social distance, I told her I would run people over with my scooter!\u201d", "Like Chambers, Roper has found keeping a journal helpful, especially during long stints in hospital. \u201cI also have a blog, and do \u2018laughter yoga\u2019, which is based on the idea that your body benefits from laughing even when we pretend to laugh.\u201d She has a carer who helps her with chores around the house, so that she can spend more time doing the things she loves. \u201cThis used to make me feel guilty, but my doctor explained that it\u2019s best to use my energy for things I am passionate about.\u201d", "Feelings of guilt can be a challenge for people with chronic conditions, particularly when the illness is hidden. Emmanuel-Jones says it\u2019s important to embrace being selfish, and adjust your mindset to prioritise your health. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look after yourself, even if you start by giving yourself small treats,\u201d he says. \u201cYou never have to feel bad or explain or justify yourself. The world isn\u2019t very sympathetic towards people with chronic conditions and disability. Like with this virus, so many people don\u2019t think it will affect them so they aren\u2019t bothered. The truth is that conditions affect people differently and I hope, in time, the world can become more mindful and accommodating of this.\u201d", "\u2018Part of being human is knowing that you can\u2019t live a perfect life\u2019 ... Helen Roper, who has cystic fibrosis. Photograph: provided by Helen Roper", "Mental health and chronic illness are closely linked, with people who have long-term conditions more likely to develop anxiety and depression. \u201cAnxiety can also exacerbate people\u2019s symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of physical and mental ill-health,\u201d says Julie Baah, an NHS psychologist. \u201cAs well as the physical symptoms, the uncertainty of living with long-term illness causes stress. A lot of people don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to get better or when they are going to have bad days.\u201d Any support should be led by the individual, as the things people need help with can vary greatly, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to managing long-term conditions. \u201cThere can be a lot of shame and guilt when people find their progress goes backwards, even though this is part of the process,\u201d says Baah. \u201cMany people will need support in managing their new realities and setting goals for themselves.\u201d", "For Steve Giles, who lives with severe arthritis and sciatica, it took years to reach a place of acceptance. After many years of failed operations and pain medication, his mental health spiralled and he found it harder to function. \u201cI was homeless for a short period, too, and when I ate it was always junk food. Pizza was the easiest thing to put in the oven due to the pain. I was really in a bad way with pain and my mental health. I\u2019d tried mindfulness, which was helpful, but once you let it lapse it becomes hard to get back into it.\u201d Eventually, he was referred to the NHS Centre for Integrated Care in Glasgow, which offers people with chronic conditions a wide range of ways to improve their quality of life. \u201cFor the first time I felt listened to by health professionals. I was put back on a mindfulness refresher course and was taught a number of breathing techniques.\u201d", "He received support to change his diet, and invested in a slow cooker so that he could easily make healthy, simple recipes. \u201cEating well has made a big difference. I\u2019ve also tried a number of therapies, such as acupuncture, which have been helpful.\u201d", "Before he went to the centre, he says he had been waiting for a cure to \u201crestart my life. Part of my therapy has been about accepting my condition and learning to live and do what I can.\u201d Although Giles has struggled to make friends throughout his life because of Asperger\u2019s, he has spent the past few years engaging with others who have his condition and built new relationships. \u201cThe holistic therapies have given me my life back. I love tinkering around with machines at home and going on walks down to the river to watch the boats. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but it makes me happy.\u201d During lockdown, he joined a seated tai chi class online. \u201cIt\u2019s adapted so that anyone can do it and helps me to stretch and move. That\u2019s been a huge boost to my mental health.\u201d", "Roper believes that \u201cliving in the moment\u201d is an important part of wellbeing for people with long-term conditions. It\u2019s something she has worked on through acceptance and commitment therapy, which was offered to her on the NHS. \u201cPart of being human is knowing that you can\u2019t live a perfect life, and that you have to live with uncertainty. A lot of happiness comes down to learning to accept the here and now.
