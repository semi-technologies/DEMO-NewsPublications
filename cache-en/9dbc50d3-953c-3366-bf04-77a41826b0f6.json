Chunky knits, silks, and boucl\u00e9 have been staples for well-dressed stars who\u2019ve filled the week\u2019s virtual press appearances and front rows. Instead of mere statement dresses, they offered a lively mix of statement materials. At the premiere of her latest film, Songbird, Sofia Carson led the pack with a custom Prada gown composed of layers of beading and tassels. All white with a flapper-inspired silhouette that moved with the actress as she posed for pictures, the look was a roaring twenties throwback ideal for a performer who appreciates glamour.", "Photocalls and in-person interviews are currently out of the question, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Tessa Thompson from filling the Sylvie\u2019s Love press tour with style moments. As she gave interviews from her backyard last week, the actress showed off a new way to wear fringe. In a textured knit suit from St. John detailed with braided tassels, Thompson went for refinement. Though her look would have been appropriate for a business meeting, Thompson\u2019s addition of Guiseppe Zanotti white ankle boots and sculptural earrings from MonSecret kept things youthful.", "High gloss finishes remained on-trend. At Dior Men\u2019s virtual show, Christina Ricci provided an early preview of Kim Jones and Kenny Scharf\u2019s dynamic Fall 2021 collaboration. Ricci proved how versatile Jones\u2019s aesthetic is in a sleek trench and logo embellished turtleneck from the collection. The same offbeat and edgy pieces worn by lanky male models who frequent Dior Men\u2019s runway are feminine and elegant on Ricci\u2014further proof that style all boils down to the wearer.", "As host of the MTV Movie & TV Awards, Vanessa Hudgens switched outfits multiple times, but a shiny black number from Christopher Kane\u2019s Fall 2020 show stood out within her wardrobe. With its PVC bodice, cutouts, and full skirt the dress was daring yet universally appealing. Earlier this month, Alexa Chung dazzled in a romantic, silver sequin number from the same collection with a similar silhouette. Still, Hudgens\u2019 version, with its contrast of textures, went in a sleek new direction, one wholly appropriate for the awards show known for its risky fashions and outr\u00e9 sensibility."], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "keywords": ["white", "carson", "sofia", "went", "silhouette", "best", "textures", "dressed", "tassels", "victoria", "style", "thompson", "tessa", "statement", "beckham", "celebrities", "sleek", "virtual"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
