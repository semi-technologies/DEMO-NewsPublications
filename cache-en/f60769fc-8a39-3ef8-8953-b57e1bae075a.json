(It\u2019s not hard to see how he might have inspired Rosal\u00eda\u2019s own iconoclastic take on the genre, which came about after she spent more than a decade training in the art form.) Rosal\u00eda has also cited Lola Flores as a key influence. Arguably the best known international export from Spain\u2019s flamenco scene, Flores\u2019s style is one that conforms to the history of flamenco dress\u2014gold hoop earrings, red lipstick, an artfully slicked hairline, black and red lace, and more ruffles than you can shake a stick at.", "Yet what has made Rosal\u00eda\u2019s style evolution so thrilling to watch is how her eclectic sonic palette, which merges flamenco with everything from hip-hop to electro-pop to R&B, is reflected in her style too. Just take her outfit at Mad Cool Festival in Madrid last year, in which the tiered ruffles of the traje de flamenca are reinterpreted as a billowing top in mint green, paired with high-waist hot pants to bring the look firmly into the present day. There\u2019s the opulently beaded Burberry dress she wore to last year\u2019s MTV Music Video Awards, its formfitting silhouette and jet black hue recalling the drama of traditional Andalusian fashion. For an even more playful take on these traditions, there\u2019s the oversized Balmain suit she wore to the 2019 MTV European Music Awards, its contrasting polka dots pointing to those which adorn the dresses of southern Spain, which are believed to have originated in India via the nomadic gypsies from whom the culture of flamenco originates.", "Rosal\u00eda attends the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards wearing Burberry.

In the video for her chart-topping, Latin Grammy\u2013winning hit \u201cCon Altura\u201d\u2014a collaboration with the Colombian reggaeton star J. Balvin\u2014Rosal\u00eda wears colors and silhouettes that subtly nod to her background in flamenco while updating it with novelty, logo-heavy prints in kaleidoscopic colors. And of course there\u2019s her well-known love of a statement manicure, perhaps best admired in her video for the hit single \u201cAute Cuture,\u201d in which she sports nails that can only be described as giant golden talons; the singer has noted in the past it is a tribute to one of her musical heroes, Lil\u2019 Kim.", "What\u2019s most exciting of all about Rosal\u00eda\u2019s style, however, is that she\u2019s only just getting started. With her third album nearly completed and her most recent collaborations involving the likes of avant-garde pop mastermind Arca, all we can say for sure about her next steps musically is to expect the unexpected. But when it comes to fashion, you can be confident there\u2019ll be many more flamenco-inspired details to come\u2014as filtered through her distinctive, whimsical lens, of course. If there\u2019s one thing Rosal\u00eda has made clear, it\u2019s that she never forgets where she came from.", "Rosal\u00eda performs at a concert in Barcelona, Spain in 2019.
