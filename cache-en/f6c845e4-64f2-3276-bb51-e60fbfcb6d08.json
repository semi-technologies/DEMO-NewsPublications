I am smart. I am worthy of love. I love myself. Some people wake up in the morning and say these things to themselves as daily affirmations. But me? These are just things I think about myself all the time. So when I hear words like \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cvulnerability,\u201d my first reaction is, please keep that codswallop away from me. In essence, I\u2019m the polar opposite of Bren\u00e9 Brown, who has made it her life\u2019s work to embrace these concepts. To study them, she\u2019s conducted thousands of interviews. And her TED Talks on the subject have been viewed millions of times. She\u2019s a regular guest speaker at Silicon Valley and Fortune 500 companies. Oprah Winfrey loves her. Her books are bestsellers. Her quotes are all over Instagram. Her ideas are everywhere. But before this interview, I still didn\u2019t get it. Why would I want to explore vulnerability or shame? I grew up Catholic, and there\u2019s a lot of guilting and shaming. I haven\u2019t been in a church since I had my confirmation. I did it for my grandmother. But I think shame, it reminds me when I was young, when I went for the first time to first holy confession. I don\u2019t know if you \u2014", "brene brown", "Grew up Catholic.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, and the priest was like, \u201cSay your confession.\u201d And I said, \u201cI have none. I\u2019m nine. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d And he said, \u201cEverybody has a sin,\u201d and I said, \u201cNot me. I don\u2019t.\u201d And I remember thinking, wow, this is like a monopoly on shame. Even at the time, I was like, why are they forcing me into a shameful period? I\u2019m just not going to do it. And I got in trouble, and I declined to express any shame in myself. So when you\u2019re thinking about the idea of shame, are you trying to seize it back or redefine it?", "brene brown", "I\u2019m just trying to define it in a way that\u2019s accessible that people understand. I mean, the thing about shame is, we all have it. No one wants to talk about it. And the less you talk about it, the more you have it. And it\u2019s not sin. The best way to describe shame is the feeling that we experience when we don\u2019t feel good enough, when we feel not blank enough\u2014 smart enough, pretty enough, strong enough, powerful enough, influential enough, relevant enough. And that kind of warm wash comes over us, and we feel alone. But we all have experiences of shame in our lives.", "kara swisher", "It\u2019s a shameful word. But go ahead.", "brene brown", "Oh, no, it is. We have a visceral response to it, yeah. It\u2019s like, I\u2019ll give you an example from the political climate today. Like, if I read another tweet that says, man, what a shameless administration \u2014", "kara swisher", "Right.", "brene brown", "\u2014 wrong. Wrong. Shame is much more likely to be driving these behaviors than the cure for it. And I\u2019ll tell you why. What we have is an empathy crisis. And here\u2019s what\u2019s really complicated about these emotions. Shame and empathy really have a hard time coexisting in people for this reason. Shame is completely self-focused. In fact, of all the kind of personality disorders, shame drives narcissism more than anything else. I define narcissism as the shame-based fear of being ordinary.", "kara swisher", "So they\u2019re not shameless. They\u2019re full of shame, is what you\u2019re saying.", "brene brown", "They\u2019re full of shame.", "kara swisher", "Full of shame, but without empathy to stop it.", "brene brown", "And that kills empathy. Right. And the reason why these two things have a hard time coexisting is that shame is self-focused. Empathy is other-focused. But shame, it forces us to believe we\u2019re alone. I always say, if you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow into every corner of our lives \u2014 secrecy, silence, and judgment. But if you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and you douse it with empathy, you\u2019ve created a hostile environment. The minute you know you\u2019re not alone and that your experience is human and you\u2019re met with empathy, shame just doesn\u2019t survive. And that\u2019s why I think vulnerability is a requirement for building shame resilience, but the actual antidote to shame is empathy.", "kara swisher", "I just did a show with Esther Perel also \u2014", "brene brown", "Hmm.", "kara swisher", "\u2014 and we talked about \u2014 she goes, \u201cWhat is your vulnerability?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any.\u201d And what I meant to say was, I don\u2019t mind being scared. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m good with scared. I\u2019m good with fear. I\u2019m good with messing up. I feel fine if people don\u2019t like what I say. And I was trying to think why that would be. And my dad died when I was five, and so, I have a feeling a lot of people whose parents died at a young age are highly functional, so that they have the worst thing happen to them. They know it. They know that the worst thing can happen, and you survive. And so, being vulnerable doesn\u2019t bother you in any way.", "brene brown", "I think when you talk about losing your dad at five, which is such a, like, whew, very tender age, you know? Old enough to understand, old enough to grieve, old enough to really understand the permanence of it. I think two things can happen. Depending on your personality and how you think about things in your environment, you can say, I have survived the worst. Or you can say, I\u2019m going to live always afraid of loving something or someone because it can be taken away. So I think there\u2019s not one monolithic response to that. But I do think fear and vulnerability are different things. And it\u2019s a very hard line I think to draw between fear and vulnerability. And so, let me give you some examples from the data, just some qualitative. We asked people to give us examples of vulnerability, and they ranged from vulnerability is the first date after my divorce. Vulnerability is having to fire someone. Vulnerability is trying to get pregnant after my second miscarriage. Vulnerability is saying, \u201cI love you,\u201d first. So I would say the difference between vulnerability and fear is, vulnerability is about showing up when you can\u2019t control the outcome. And I don\u2019t know that that always \u2014 that does not always make me feel afraid, but it can make me feel vulnerable. And if you, Kara, walk through the world in a way that you expect ambiguity, you expect uncertainty, you\u2019re comfortable with discomfort, that might minimize your feelings of vulnerability. And that will make you a huge outlier.", "kara swisher", "Outlier in what way?", "brene brown", "99% of the people I\u2019ve ever interviewed or worked with have ways of self protecting and vulnerability that moved them away from who they want to be, move them away from a sense of meaning and purpose and love in their lives. So I think I\u2019m better at vulnerability. I\u2019ve been practicing it for so long. I know when I\u2019m in it, and I know what to watch out for in terms of my behaviors. But I do think normalizing discomfort is hard.", "kara swisher", "OK, so you can say \u2014 I\u2019m a bit of a vulnerability skeptic. Let me tell you what\u2019s in my wallet right now. Two sayings, which is, if you can\u2019t feel the pain, you aren\u2019t going to feel anything else, and the world is full of suffering and death. Those that know this are at peace, though in a world of pain.", "brene brown", "Well, those are the two most vulnerable quotes I probably have ever heard in ever.", "kara swisher", "OK, I\u2019ve got a lot of them.", "brene brown", "So it\u2019s interesting because you describe yourself as not a vulnerable person. I would describe you in full embrace of vulnerability.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, I suppose. OK. All right, nicely done, but how come?", "brene brown", "One more time. Let\u2019s take the first one.", "kara swisher", "Sure. Here we go. If you can\u2019t feel the pain, you aren\u2019t going to feel anything else, meaning feel the pain.", "brene brown", "Right. OK, so if you interviewed 100 therapists and started with Esther Perel and said, how would you summarize what you see in people, they would probably say to you, the majority of my work is helping people turn and face the pain and stop running from it. But that vulnerability that it requires to face pain, the uncertainty, the risk of facing pain, is not something people do comfortably. So that is a master class in pain. And to say \u2014 it\u2019s like, I think about one of my favorite quotes is from Pema Chodron, the American Buddhist nun. And she talks about compassion, that compassion is not a relationship between the wounded and the healed. It\u2019s a relationship between equals. It\u2019s knowing your darkness well enough that you can sit in the dark with others.", "kara swisher", "It\u2019s interesting you talk about knowing your darkness. I actually have a T-shirt that says, \u201cThe dark is afraid of me,\u201d that I got in Ocean City. That\u2019s where I get my wisdom, not from \u2014", "brene brown", "Wow.", "kara swisher", "\u2014 Buddhist nuns.", "brene brown", "[LAUGHS] Wow. I like it.", "kara swisher", "It\u2019s a good T-shirt. I love it. It always works for me. All right, so what\u2019s the difference between not feeling that you\u2019re vulnerable, which I often do feel, and not caring what people think of you?", "brene brown", "If you take in all the data about what people think, you will lose the ability to be brave with your life. I believe that. But if you don\u2019t care what anyone thinks, you lose your capacity for connection. So you risk losing your capacity for vulnerability if you take it all in. If you don\u2019t take any of it in, which is kind of \u2014 I\u2019ve been teaching masters and PhD level students for 20 years. And the increase in, I don\u2019t give a shit of what anyone thinks, is so alarming because it\u2019s like, when I see people say that, I literally \u2014 it\u2019s like that movie, I see dead people. I literally see their 12-year-old self standing in front of me like an after school special, saying, I don\u2019t care what anyone thinks. We all care. What it comes down to and what we try to help people understand is, make a list of people whose opinions matter. And these people should be people who love you, not despite your imperfection and vulnerability, but because of it.", "kara swisher", "Mhm. But most of them don\u2019t listen. When I visit Silicon Valley people and sometimes I look at a thing, and I think, that\u2019s terrible. And they\u2019re like, what? And I was like, oh, I\u2019m sorry. People lick you up and down all day, so you\u2019re not used to someone disagreeing with you.", "brene brown", "It\u2019s a weird place, right?", "kara swisher", "It is, indeed. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about that. So, you know, your work has grabbed the ears of celebrities, like Oprah, leaders at NASA, executives of Fortune 500 companies, tech companies. It\u2019s taught to business leaders at places like Stanford. These are very fancy people you\u2019re talking to. Is vulnerability a privilege for the 1%? Because they get all soft and squishy when they talk about you, but they don\u2019t live it in their lives. They don\u2019t actually \u2014 it\u2019s something they like to talk about, just like they like to fast or drink fresh kombucha shakes or something like that. When you think about that, is it a privilege for people?", "brene brown", "I think it\u2019s yes and. I think that for some people, I am the kombucha shake of the month. And we get this a lot. And I will tell you, it\u2019s disproportionately from Silicon Valley. You\u2019re a CEO, and you want me on your speed dial. And because some leaders \u2014 and not just in Silicon Valley \u2014 but some leaders can collect thought leader people like they collect, you know, all kinds of shit. But I\u2019ve never done that. No one\u2019s ever had me on speed dial before. And if they say come talk to my company, and I ask who\u2019s going to be in the audience, and they say my people but not me or my leadership team, then I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not your person. I don\u2019t take any jobs anymore that I don\u2019t want to take. So if you\u2019re serious about culture change and you want to bring me in, and you don\u2019t mind being called out in front of your people, then I\u2019m your person. And you\u2019ll need to pay me up front. And you can\u2019t tell me what to say. And you can\u2019t record me. And you can\u2019t publicly talk about me working with you or your people.", "kara swisher", "Oh, wow.", "brene brown", "Yeah.", "kara swisher", "OK, and \u2014", "brene brown", "And so we try to vet for that.", "kara swisher", "And what do they say to that? Because they want to put you on like a badge. Like, ah, I Bren\u00e9 Browned myself here, or something.", "brene brown", "Yeah, I mean, I can also be the rehabilitation speaker, you know? I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not your girl if you\u2019re in trouble around something. Go somewhere else. 50% of them say yes to the terms, and then 50% of them say no. And we ask a lot of questions. Like, how does me coming in, talking for an hour, fit into a larger strategic plan to change the culture? And am I allowed to talk to people that have the least amount of power and influence in the company before I come?", "kara swisher", "Right, so a lot of it could be just giving speeches. And I got to tell you, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re actually practicing vulnerability.", "brene brown", "Some are, some aren\u2019t.", "kara swisher", "All right, when you go into a company, when you\u2019re trying to change leaders, what do you see that\u2019s the most difficult?", "brene brown", "A leader who has no self-awareness at all. Period, hard stop.", "kara swisher", "Which manifests itself how?", "brene brown", "No self-reflection, no rigorous inventory of their own limitations. They\u2019re working their shit out on other people. Just a lack of self-awareness.", "kara swisher", "Right, which is common. This is about leadership and not leaders show vulnerability. For example, Donald Trump. Let\u2019s go to that. Let\u2019s go right to the top. People celebrate, you know, what he\u2019s doing. And it\u2019s interesting you said shamelessness is actually a lot of shame combined with lack of empathy. But it gets telegraphed as tell it like it is. And he is authentic. He has a lot of the elements that you talk about. Authentic \u2014", "brene brown", "No.", "kara swisher", "\u2014 not scared. OK, all right, not authentic. I think it\u2019s authentic to him, whether \u2014", "brene brown", "No \u2014", "kara swisher", "\u2014himself. OK, all right, all right.", "brene brown", "I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know him, so I won\u2019t comment on him as a person.", "kara swisher", "OK, not as a person, but you look at his leadership. You can see his leadership. He famously thinks he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose votes. How do you explain his rise to power and what he represents? Because these ideas of tell it like it is, I\u2019m great, I believe in myself, with proof overwhelming that maybe you shouldn\u2019t believe in yourself.", "brene brown", "So if we look at power, what we see is there are different types of power. There is power over on one end of the continuum, and on the other end of the continuum, there\u2019s a collection of different types of power: power with, power to, and power within. So if you\u2019re going to use power over as a leader, whether you\u2019re leading the United States or you\u2019re leading family-run business, it\u2019s going to require a regular number of flexes of your power that instill fear in some group of people. That\u2019s how you maintain it. Like, have you ever watched a movie, and you\u2019ve got the bad guy. And then the bad guy just keeps doing increasingly horrific things. And you want to just scream at the writer or director, OK, we get it, he\u2019s bad. We don\u2019t have to have him taking someone\u2019s eyeballs out with a spoon. We get it. But there\u2019s a reason because to maintain power over, you have to do these cruelty flexes. I mean, and this is history. This is the history of power over. The Trump administration has led a perfect power over game. And they\u2019ve used fear, and here\u2019s the bottom line. Power over leaders have a very simple belief. It is power is finite. It\u2019s like a pizza. If there are eight pieces and I give Kara one, I have seven. This is a zero sum game. Power is finite. On the other side, we have leaders that say power is infinite and grows when shared.", "kara swisher", "So that\u2019s power with.", "brene brown", "That\u2019s power with. That\u2019s power to. That\u2019s creating power within. So, this is the saddest answer that I\u2019ll ever give around any question probably of my career. So you ask, why does 70 million people vote for power over? Here\u2019s the biggest mistake we make, Kara. Never assume that people want courageous leadership. That is not a safe assumption. It is not a safe assumption that people want to have some power and be held accountable for it.", "kara swisher", "So you\u2019re not surprised by this at all, in any way, that it works.", "brene brown", "No, no, no, no, no, no. And so, when he was attacking political correctness, he spoke to people who felt ashamed, not smart enough. They felt like, my kids say, God, dad, you can\u2019t say that. Or now I want to give you some hard feedback about your work, Lydia. You need to watch the way you\u2019re stereotyping, you know. And then that shame and no place to put it. And it\u2019s so funny because there\u2019s that great image of the T-shirt or the flags during the boat parade that say, \u201cFuck your feelings.\u201d You know that big flag?", "kara swisher", "Yes, yes, that\u2019s their favorite saying.", "brene brown", "That is, as someone who spent 20 years studying affect and emotion, that is the biggest display of emotion you\u2019ve ever seen. The irony in that flag, that is a feeling flag. It\u2019s like the T-shirt that says, \u201cDeath to extremists.\u201d Like \u2014 [LAUGHTER]", "kara swisher", "I forgot about that one.", "brene brown", "Remember that T-shirt?", "kara swisher", "Yes, yes.", "brene brown", "Yeah, it was really popular.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, it was. And they aren\u2019t getting the irony. You\u2019re right. So you\u2019re a social worker. Let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re assigned to the case of Donald Trump. How would you help him acknowledge his loss? Because he\u2019s on a cliff right now.", "brene brown", "Well, first of all, I\u2019m not taking that case with him or any other politician probably as a social worker. And I\u2019m a researcher, not a practitioner. So I have an easy offramp there, a tapout.", "kara swisher", "So you wouldn\u2019t take it. You wouldn\u2019t take the job.", "brene brown", "Mm-mm, no.", "kara swisher", "It\u2019s interesting. Jane Goodall, Esther Perel, and you will not take the case of Donald Trump. I\u2019ve asked all of you, would you talk to him, and Jane Goodall \u2014 nicest person on Earth \u2014 no, no, never going to talk to him.", "brene brown", "Oh, I\u2019m in such great company because I just revere both of those women. I respect them.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, and Esther\u2019s like, you can\u2019t therapize a narcissist. But if you had to \u2014 here you are, you have to help him to deal with loss. What would you do?", "brene brown", "This is a great part of this, Kara. I don\u2019t have to.", "kara swisher", "I get that, but I\u2019m making you. I\u2019m saying \u2014", "brene brown", "No. Yeah, you can\u2019t.", "kara swisher", "Come on. OK, if I\u2019m going to do it, what can I help him acknowledge his loss? I\u2019m in a room with Donald Trump, and I\u2019ve got to help him acknowledge his loss. Is it impossible?", "brene brown", "You know what? I\u2019ll be totally serious here. I can evaluate his leadership as a citizen of the country and as someone who\u2019s in the 10th year of a leadership study. I don\u2019t know him diagnostically, clinically, or personally. I couldn\u2019t tell you what to do. If you called me and told me you were going to do that. I guarantee you, our whole conversation would be about why you\u2019re making that choice.", "kara swisher", "Oh, about me \u2014", "brene brown", "Yes.", "kara swisher", "\u2014 trying to do the impossible. All right, so what advice would you have to his followers? People are unhappy with the election result. How do you get them to understand \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d means they\u2019re in pain?", "brene brown", "Um, well, I don\u2019t know about their \u2014 well, maybe I guess they\u2019re in pain. But I would say they\u2019re in a lot of feeling, whatever it is. Maybe it\u2019s rage, maybe it\u2019s pain, maybe it\u2019s disappointment. Maybe it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, fury. I don\u2019t know what it is. They\u2019re not a monolith, so I don\u2019t know how you would talk to them. But I think, I got to say that I have family members. And \u2014", "kara swisher", "Mm-hmm, me, too.", "brene brown", "Yeah. And to them, I say \u2014 to be honest, I wish I could say something really poetic and profound and enlightened here. And to them, I just don\u2019t talk about it. The rule in our family is, I have a line. And the line for me is dehumanization. So if people in my life who have supported Trump agree with me about dehumanization and don\u2019t believe he does that, I try to find a place. If they parrot the dehumanization, then I have, actually, unfortunately, and with great grief \u2014 and I won\u2019t diminish the pain of it \u2014 have severed those relationships. I just can\u2019t be in them.", "kara swisher", "Mm-hmm. So that\u2019s your spot.", "brene brown", "That\u2019s my line.", "kara swisher", "That\u2019s your line. Are their leaders out there who show leadership through vulnerability? Because vulnerability would be the solution to this, correct? Understanding our shame and vulnerability.", "brene brown", "It\u2019s funny because my hypothesis was fear was the greatest barrier to daring leadership. It turns out it\u2019s not. So I was like, well, if fear is not the greatest barrier to daring leadership, what is it? And it turned out that the answer is armor. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re afraid. It\u2019s how we self protect when we\u2019re afraid that gets in the way of being courageous. And those forms of armor range from perfectionism, cynicism, having to be the knower and be right versus being the learner and getting it right. And so, I would say, in many ways, Biden has shown some daring leadership. His honesty about the grief he experienced with Beau, the fact that I thought Kamala Harris gave him a harder time and was rougher on him than any other person during the primaries, and he picked her as a running mate, which is not unlike him if you look historically. He likes to surround himself with people who disagree.", "kara swisher", "He also likes to surround himself by people he\u2019s comfortable with, too, though, at the same time.", "brene brown", "He does.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, he has a real proclivity for that.", "brene brown", "He does, doesn\u2019t he?", "kara swisher", "Yeah, he does. He likes the comfy pillow. I don\u2019t know how else to put it. This pillow, I like.", "brene brown", "This pillow, I like.", "kara swisher", "I shall have this pillow.", "brene brown", "But so, he wouldn\u2019t operationalize a comfy pillow as someone afraid to give him a hard time or question him.", "kara swisher", "I suppose, yeah. Yeah, well, it\u2019s interesting because you think about Trump and all the yes people around him, but everyone has their version of yes people around them in some fashion. They always manage to be there, even if they seem difficult. You can be difficult and not really difficult, right?", "brene brown", "I don\u2019t know. I would disagree with that, I think. I would say that I have seen leaders who really invite hard things by surround themselves with people who really genuinely disagree with them and push them.", "kara swisher", "But can it really push them and change them versus just push them?", "brene brown", "Yes, I think it can.", "kara swisher", "OK, all right. I have seen a lot of people that get pushed back, and then it just doesn\u2019t change.", "brene brown", "I have seen that more often, but I have seen the other.", "kara swisher", "Is there a double standard for women leaders? You\u2019re either too emotional, too weak. You\u2019re not vulnerable enough, not emotional enough. You get attacked. I\u2019m often described as tough, and I\u2019m like, I\u2019m actually pretty pleasant to work with. But I don\u2019t mind it being there. I also am like, good. You think I\u2019m tough? Excellent. So talk about that concept, because saying I\u2019m vulnerable is not something I would say as a leader. I wouldn\u2019t. it\u2019s a mistake as a woman to do that. More I say, if you cross me, I\u2019ll break your arm, kind of thing. I\u2019d rather project that.", "brene brown", "Interesting.", "kara swisher", "I won\u2019t actually break your arm.", "brene brown", "Yeah, no, interesting. I use a lot of that, too. But I attribute it to my Texanness. I\u2019m always like, I\u2019d like to punch you in the face, but I\u2019m not going to really. But I really would like to, but I won\u2019t. It\u2019s interesting. If you want to get binary and look at women and men, and although there\u2019s a fluid continuum there, but in terms of masculine norms and feminine norms, one of the greatest shame drivers, triggers, for women is perfection. Do it all, do it perfectly. Look like you\u2019re expending no effort doing it. And so, to be vulnerable, you have to be really shame resilient to be vulnerable because you can\u2019t be super susceptible to the shame of imperfection if you\u2019re going to be vulnerable. For men, the greatest shame trigger is, do not be perceived as weak, for masculine norms. And so, to be vulnerable, you have to risk that, right? You have to risk, oh my God, people are going to see me as weak. In terms of women in leadership, I don\u2019t have any problem saying that I am a vulnerable leader. Because I\u2019m clear that there is no courage without vulnerability. And I\u2019m vulnerable and brave. I\u2019m really good at building trust.", "kara swisher", "But you have to know. Come on, women can\u2019t say it. I mean, it\u2019s just the minute they show that \u2014 I interviewed Elizabeth Warren in front of a lot of powerful men once. And they just \u2014 it looked like they just \u2014 I just don\u2019t know how to explain it. You could see them crossing their legs \u2014", "brene brown", "Oh, I know that look.", "kara swisher", "\u2014 like they were about to get kicked. You know that look. It sort of rises up, the balls go up, that kind of thing. So how do you battle that? Because \u2014 and I was like \u2014 I was trying to figure out why she bothers men. And it\u2019s interesting because she does happen to bother tech men a lot. But everyone was like, she\u2019s like the schoolmarm. And I was always saying, huh. You know, you\u2019ve never met a schoolmarm. And why are schoolmarms so badly represented? Because have you ever had a bad experience with a schoolmarm? Because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met one because you don\u2019t live on the prairie back in 1830. But \u2014", "brene brown", "[LAUGHS]", "kara swisher", "\u2014 I was like, there\u2019s no \u2014 why do we use that word around women? Because no one has met a schoolmarm in years and years. But I finally decided she\u2019s the professor in college that gave you the muchly deserved D. And you knew it, and you hated her even though she gave you what you deserved. That\u2019s what I decided. That\u2019s who she is. She\u2019s someone who told you, you sucked, and you did suck. And that\u2019s the only explanation I have. But she couldn\u2019t win because of that. You know what I mean? There was the same thing with Hillary Clinton. Likable enough, these kind of things. So showing vulnerability seemed fake when they do it. And Hillary Clinton certainly did several times, and it doesn\u2019t work for her. But then when Joe Biden does, we\u2019re all weepy. Oh, he loves his son.", "brene brown", "Oh, yeah, that\u2019s just misogyny 101. That\u2019s just gender stuff. I run into that with my career all the time just because I study vulnerability. So I write a leadership book, and it\u2019s for women. And a guy writes a leadership book, and it\u2019s for everybody. I\u2019m a social scientist with a ton of data and influential work, and I\u2019m the queen of self-help in the headline. When you call me miss and you call the person next to me doctor, and you talk about the guy as a social scientist and the researcher and me as the feel-good, poncho-wearing, self-help person, it pisses me off because it\u2019s just so gendered. And I think with Elizabeth Warren, I think it\u2019s interesting because I think it\u2019s a lack of unearned deference that really can scare some men. Like, you don\u2019t start with a appropriate level of deference toward me. And that\u2019s such bullshit. But here\u2019s the thing. If we look at some of the studies that are coming out right now around the pandemic and women leaders in countries where they had women leaders, right? You\u2019ve seen this data.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, it\u2019s clear.", "brene brown", "It\u2019s clear. But what if we \u2014", "kara swisher", "We would be less dead with more women leaders.", "brene brown", "We\u2019d be less dead with women leaders, but what was the number one driver why?", "kara swisher", "I don\u2019t know. You tell me.", "brene brown", "Empathy. Humanity. Real connection to people. Looking at people and saying, this is scary, this is hard, but we can do this. Surrounding themselves by experts. Yielding to experts, scientists, you know, the people who effing know. And so, I don\u2019t know that I would say it was because of vulnerable leadership because that\u2019s too confusing to people, but I would definitely say it was daring leadership. It was a commitment to getting it right over being right. It was a commitment to empathy. It was a commitment to shared humanity. [MUSIC PLAYING]", "kara swisher", "We\u2019ll be back in a minute.

I thought our belief in science was unmoveable.", "kara swisher", "See, I believe the opposite. I\u2019m like, Whiskey Rebellion, Salem witch trials, McCarthyism.

And I just couldn\u2019t believe with every step forward, there was like a maniacal, conspiratorial backlash.", "kara swisher", "Every time.", "brene brown", "Every time.", "kara swisher", "Every time. It\u2019s just been \u2014 the internet\u2019s made it amplified and weaponized, is what\u2019s happened to us.", "brene brown", "Jesus.", "kara swisher", "So you say connection is the goal, and without connection or fear of disconnection breeds shame, right? That\u2019s part of shame.", "brene brown", "Yeah.", "kara swisher", "So is it impossible in this interconnected world, never been more interconnected, to be connected in ways that will allow us to have that empathy, that vulnerability, to accept our shame and stuff like that? Because it seems like without physical connection, we cannot do that.", "brene brown", "No, as a social species, we\u2019re wired to be together. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, and I would call bullshit on anyone who says that they\u2019ve got a clear read on the blueprint coming out of this. But my hope is \u2014 and I know what I\u2019ll be doing. And I\u2019m not extraordinarily different than anybody else. I will not be taking, gathering, and being with people for granted moving forward. My dad and I have very different political beliefs. And weirdly, we have the same picture of the world as we\u2019d like to live in it, but we have very different ideas about how we get there. I haven\u2019t seen him since the pandemic started. I would crawl my hands and knees down I-10 to San Antonio if I could see him. And I will do what it takes to be in connection with him for the rest of his life or mine. And I will figure out how to navigate the political, social differences. And I think there are a lot of people that I\u2019ve talked to that feel the same way. So I think we will cluster up across beliefs. And I think the internet, social media, will continue to be communication tools, but they will never be tools of connection.", "kara swisher", "Do you think it\u2019s worse than that? They\u2019re tools of anti-connection, as connective as they are.", "brene brown", "I mean, to be honest with you, the Facebook stuff, I\u2019m out of my depth here, and I know you know a thousand things about it.", "kara swisher", "Sure, you know how you feel about it. You\u2019ve used it, yeah.", "brene brown", "I\u2019m scared. If there are not some regulations put on these monster tech companies, I don\u2019t understand how we protect democracy. I don\u2019t understand how we protect humanity. I mean, I have seen between the news outlets and social media \u2014", "kara swisher", "Right, which amplify each other.", "brene brown", "\u2014 I feel like we\u2019re one step away from needing the van that kidnaps people and deprograms them.", "kara swisher", "[LAUGHS] That\u2019s me.

See, it \u2014", "kara swisher", "\u2014 Captain Marvel-like skills to get the FTC to act.", "brene brown", "OK, don\u2019t even start with me in the superheroes and vulnerability because our favorite part of the superheroes are their vulnerabilities.", "kara swisher", "Oh, you\u2019re right. Ugh.", "brene brown", "We love the backstory. We love the sad death.", "kara swisher", "It\u2019s true.", "brene brown", "Yeah, and you are super vulnerable by taking on these folks.", "kara swisher", "I guess.", "brene brown", "I need you to make friends with the world.", "kara swisher", "I\u2019d rather have eyes that could burn them. Like, zzz. You know, that kind of \u2014 I\u2019d like to have \u2014", "brene brown", "[LAUGHS]", "kara swisher", "Or go like this, like Captain Marvel. Which, let me ask you, speaking of vulnerable, invulnerable people. Which of the superheroes would you be? Which one do you find most compelling?", "brene brown", "I just interviewed Gabby Rivera, who was hired by Marvel to write the first queer Latina \u2014", "kara swisher", "Great writer.", "brene brown", "\u2014 superhero. Yes.", "kara swisher", "She\u2019s a great writer. That\u2019s a great writer.", "brene brown", "So America Chavez is her superhero, who is both a badass, but talks openly about vulnerability with her superhero mentor, Storm. So yeah, I think I would be America. It\u2019s so funny because in this podcast with her, she said at some point, she\u2019s like, well, Marvel finally called me, and they\u2019re like, Gabby, she gotta fight people. She can\u2019t just talk about her feelings. She\u2019s a superhero, and so \u2014", "kara swisher", "She\u2019s gotta kick ass. Takes names \u2014", "brene brown", "Yeah, she\u2019s gotta kick someone\u2019s ass.", "kara swisher", "\u2014 and then go. I felt bad about that. But I feel a little shame. I feel shame.", "brene brown", "Yeah, feels shame. No, she talks about it. Who\u2019s your favorite? I\u2019m so curious.", "kara swisher", "Oh, I love Captain Marvel. I like her whole thing. There\u2019s so much pain there and also so much beauty. And I like Wonder Woman because she\u2019s so kind of feckless and like what? It\u2019s happy. And in the face of constant pain, she\u2019s like, yeah, great.", "brene brown", "Yeah, let\u2019s do it.", "kara swisher", "Let\u2019s do it. We could talk all day about superheroes. So I want to get to, what do you think, right now, your vulnerability, what do you think that would be?", "brene brown", "I mean, I think my greatest \u2014 I mean, the thing that still creates a lot of vulnerability in me is probably being a parent.", "kara swisher", "And why is that?", "brene brown", "Because I think it\u2019s one of the most vulnerable \u2014 to love someone so much and really not be able to keep them physically, emotionally safe and to push them out into the world when you just want to lock them in somewhere. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s a huge exercise in vulnerability. And so, I think parenting is always a vulnerability. When my kids hurt, I hurt. And I know I have to let them \u2014 I want them to have in their wallet similar things to what you wrote and have in your wallet.", "kara swisher", "So one of the things you talked about with the parental vulnerability, I would say that would be my vulnerability. And I recall when I \u2014I don\u2019t know if you know this but about six years ago, I had a stroke, which was kind of ironic, given my dad died of a brain aneurysm \u2014", "brene brown", "Geez.", "kara swisher", "\u2014 very suddenly. And so, I had a stroke. I was in Hong Kong. And as usual, I was like, I can deal with this. I went through the whole thing. I go to the hospital. I was very collected and cool. I was not scared. I talked to my brother. And there was a doctor with a mask in front of me. And he said what I thought was true. He said, oh, you\u2019re having a stroke right now, and we have to get you in the hospital right now. And instead of being worried about myself, the only thing I thought about was me dying and my kids being alone. That was \u2014", "brene brown", "Oh, yeah.", "kara swisher", "And then, I realized it was about me, right? It wasn\u2019t about \u2014 it was about them, but it was about me remembering what that was like, the loss, and the understanding how well my kid who at the time was five \u2014", "brene brown", "Oh God.", "kara swisher", "\u2014 knew me and how \u2014 and it was like \u2014 and that\u2019s the only time I cried. I can count on my fingers the times I\u2019ve cried in my life recently. And that was it, and that was the moment. I was like, oh, I\u2019m crying for me. I\u2019m not crying. I\u2019m crying for the idea of loss. And it was really \u2014 it was an interesting moment. And I was OK with it. I was good.", "brene brown", "Yeah, you could crying for both of them because that\u2019s \u2014 yeah.", "kara swisher", "Yeah, it was a big one. It was a vulnerable moment. That was a vulnerability. That was \u2014", "brene brown", "Oh, damn it! [LAUGHS] We\u2019ve arrived, Esther Perel! We got here!", "kara swisher", "Otherwise, I think I\u2019m great. Sorry. Sorry, I do.", "brene brown", "No, stop saying you\u2019ve got vulnerability otherwise.
