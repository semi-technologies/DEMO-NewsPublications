Author of Cooking Solo, she\u2019s championed the culinary joy of compact creations. While most recipes out there have a serving size four to six, Miller\u2019s recipes are for one to three (so, perfect for those celebrating by themselves or with a pod). Ahead of November 26, she shares her top tips on how to execute a tiny, yet memorable, Thanksgiving\u2014as well as her perfect holiday dessert recipe for mini chestnut cakes.", "1. Be Honest With Yourself", "\u201cDo you feel like having an elaborate (i.e. large) holiday meal if you're celebrating solo or with one other person? If you are up for a big meal\u2014go forth and make all your favorite festive dishes (ask your relatives and friends for their best recipes),\u201d says Miller. \u201c[But] If you're not really into a massive holiday meal this year but have the energy to cook (let's face it, cooking fatigue at this point in 2020 is real) then focus on just one or two things to make it feel special.\u201d", "2. Make Your Own Rules", "Thanksgiving meals are often dictated by what we think we should eat\u2014turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie. And, if you\u2019re gung-ho about those things, go for it! But if not, now\u2019s your chance to break from tradition. \u201cIf you're dining solo for the holidays, I would recommend you go over the top in indulging yourself with whatever you want to eat. Start with dessert? Why not?\u201d says Miller. \u201cTake advantage of not having to please anyone else and please yourself with whatever kind of meal you feel like eating.\u201d", "3. Splurge\u2014And Plan Another Great Meal With the Leftovers", "Planning a big group meal is expensive. But this year, there\u2019s only a few months to feed\u2014so why not finally get that gourmet cut of meat, or expensive wine? \u201cThink of things you've been meaning to cook or splurge on and make them. If you're a carnivore but have never cooked a rib-eye, do that,\u201d says Miller. \u201cCook two and if you don't completely devour them, the leftover meat can be used to put in tacos the next day. \u201c"], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "keywords": ["solo", "holiday", "think", "youre", "miller", "things", "feel", "cook", "spectacular", "thanksgiving", "recipes", "meal"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
