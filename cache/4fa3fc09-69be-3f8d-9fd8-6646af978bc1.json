At Lokanta, a Turkish restaurant that opened in April, it manifests, counterintuitively, in the blustery bearing of the chef and owner, Orhan Yegen. There are very few people who can make slightly grumpy, brusque confidence come across as alluring and even charming. Yegen, a veteran restaurateur who also owns Sip Sak, in Manhattan (the menus overlap significantly), is one of them, with a reputation that precedes him; the thrill of hearing his dramatic proclamations is one of the draws of his establishments. \u201cIf I was a normal person, I wouldn\u2019t have come to this country,\u201d he declared one evening in May, as he surfed around Lokanta\u2019s dining room. \u201cI\u2019m not normal\u2014I\u2019m an artist.\u201d", "Fish is prepared and served simply, with lemon, salad, and rice. Photograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New Yorker", "The other draw here is the food, which is, if not art per se, certainly artful. The voguish approach to vegetables these days often involves doing very little to them, so it\u2019s refreshing to find that Yegen\u2019s faithful adherence to the traditions of his native country largely dictates the opposite. Cooked fava beans are mashed into a paste that is smooth but still chunky, sprinkled with fresh dill and boldly seasoned with a flavor that\u2019s familiar but at first difficult to place: cinnamon! This appears on the \u201csmall plates\u201d (translation: meze) part of the menu, which also includes leeks that have been confited in olive oil until they fall apart into meltingly luscious sheets, served cold; tender braised artichoke hearts, topped with whole favas and more dill; and fluffy squares of what\u2019s described as a pancake but is more like a kugel made with shredded zucchini and carrots.", "Lokanta is one of only a handful of Turkish restaurants in Astoria, and one of relatively few in New York. Photograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New Yorker", "Yegen puts equal effort into meat, particularly lamb. You might think that one restaurant does not need seven lamb entr\u00e9es (of fifteen total), but Lokanta (which means \u201crestaurant\u201d in Turkish) proves you wrong. Glossy shreds of roasted lamb are spectacular mixed with warm rice, currants, caramelized onions, and allspice, then gently molded into a dome; tender, saucy hunks of braised lamb crown a bowl of beguilingly creamy eggplant pur\u00e9e, which takes on an almost stretchy texture thanks to the addition of dehydrated yogurt. As a special one recent night, ground lamb was formed into a log-shaped adana kebab, grilled until crispy and smoky, and served on an intoxicatingly oily slab of fried flatbread.", "A meze, or small plate, of mashed fava beans is seasoned with cinnamon and topped with fresh dill. Photograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New Yorker", "There is beef, too, rolled into rustic meatballs and served simply with potatoes, or sealed into dainty dumplings called manti, which are blanketed in a thick, garlicky yogurt sauce and drizzled with chili oil. Seafood is less successful. A pescatarian could be happy with expertly prepared if unexciting fillets of sea bass or salmon, but an intriguing-sounding shrimp casserole with tomatoes and kasseri cheese (made of sheep\u2019s and goat\u2019s milk) is a rare miss, its scorching temperature giving way to surprising blandness. For dessert, return to vegetables: among the standard rice pudding and baklava, a dish of barely sweetened baked butternut squash, topped with whipped cream and chopped walnuts, stands out.", "For dessert, baked butternut squash is lightly sweetened with sugar and finished with walnuts and a dollop of whipped cream. Photograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New Yorker", "Lokanta is one of a small handful of Turkish restaurants in Astoria\u2014a neighborhood that\u2019s long been associated with Greek food but has, in fact, grown quite culinarily diverse\u2014and one of relatively few in the city. Its most important distinction, however, may be the weekends-only breakfast menu. For years, I have searched in vain for a decent Turkish breakfast in New York, longing to re-create a dreamy morning I spent in Istanbul at an open-air caf\u00e9 in view of the Bosporus, noshing on a simple but seductive array of fresh bread, cheese with honey and marmalade, hard-boiled eggs, olives, cucumbers, and tomatoes.", "Finally, here is a similar platter\u2014plus baked eggs, clotted cream, flaky gozleme (which the menu calls \u201cTurkish quesadillas\u201d), and pastries, including braided sesame rings known as simit. There is no glittering turquoise strait to gaze upon at Lokanta, and the restaurant\u2019s interior resembles nothing so much as a West Elm showroom, with tropical-leaf wallpaper and generic-looking gold tchotchkes. One Saturday morning, I felt transported nonetheless\u2014and grateful to Yegen for being so sure of himself. (Entr\u00e9es $19-$22.) \u2666"], "pubDate": null, "id": "4fa3fc09-69be-3f8d-9fd8-6646af978bc1", "keywords": ["rice", "food", "yegen", "haruka", "photograph", "lokanta", "turkish", "lamb", "small", "sakaguchi", "topped", "served", "attitude"], "title": "Turkish Food with Attitude at Lokanta", "summary": "At Lokanta, a Turkish restaurant that opened in April, it manifests, counterintuitively, in the blustery bearing of the chef and owner, Orhan Yegen.\nPhotograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New YorkerThe other draw here is the food, which is, if not art per se, certainly artful.\nLokanta is one of only a handful of Turkish restaurants in Astoria, and one of relatively few in New York.\nPhotograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New YorkerYegen puts equal effort into meat, particularly lamb.\nYou might think that one restaurant does not need seven lamb entr\u00e9es (of fifteen total), but Lokanta (which means \u201crestaurant\u201d in Turkish) proves you wrong.", "authors": ["Hannah Goldfield", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
