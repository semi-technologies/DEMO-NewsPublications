It was the late nineties, when the Web was young, and everyone was trying to cash in on the dot-com boom. In college, two of my dorm mates and I discovered that we\u2019d each started an Internet company in high school, and we merged them to form a single, teen-age megacorp. For around six hundred dollars a month, we rented office space in the basement of a building in town. We made Web sites and software for an early dating service, an insurance-claims-processing firm, and an online store where customers could \u201cbargain\u201d with a cartoon avatar for overstock goods. I lived large, spending the money I made on tuition, food, and a stereo.", "In 1999\u2014our sophomore year\u2014we hit it big. A company that wired mid-tier office buildings with high-speed Internet hired us to build a collaborative work environment for its customers: Slack, avant la lettre. It was a huge project, entrusted to a few college students through some combination of recklessness and charity. We were terrified that we\u2019d taken on work we couldn\u2019t handle but also felt that we were on track to create something innovative. We blew through deadlines and budgets until the C-suite demanded a demo, which we built. Newly confident, we hired our friends, and used our corporate AmEx to expense a \u201cbusiness dinner\u201d at Nobu. Unlike other kids, who were what\u2014socializing?\u2014I had a business card that said \u201cCreative Director.\u201d After midnight, in our darkened office, I nestled my Aeron chair into my IKEA desk, queued up Nine Inch Nails in Winamp, scrolled code, peeped pixels, and entered the matrix. After my client work was done, I\u2019d write short stories for my creative-writing workshops. Often, I slept on the office futon, waking to plunder the vending machine next to the loading dock, where a homeless man lived with his cart.", "I liked this entrepreneurial existence\u2014its ambition, its scrappy, near-future velocity. I thought I might move to San Francisco and work in tech. I saw a path, an opening into life. But, as the dot-com bubble burst, our client\u2019s business was acquired by a firm that was acquired by another firm that didn\u2019t want what we\u2019d made. Our invoices went unpaid. It was senior year\u2014a fork in the road. We closed our business and moved out of the office. A few days before graduation, when I went to pay my tuition bill, a girl on the elevator struck up a conversation, then got off at her floor; on my ride down, she stepped on for a second time, and our conversation continued. We started dating, then went to graduate school in English together. We got married, I became a journalist, and we had a son. I now have a life, a world, a story. I\u2019m me, not him\u2014whoever he might have turned out to be.", "\u201cThe thought that I might have become someone else is so bland that dwelling on it sometimes seems fatuous,\u201d the literary scholar Andrew H. Miller writes, in \u201cOn Not Being Someone Else: Tales of Our Unled Lives\u201d (Harvard). Still, phrased the right way, the thought has an insistent, uncanny magnetism. Miller\u2019s book is, among other things, a compendium of expressions of wonder over what might have been. Miller quotes Clifford Geertz, who, in \u201cThe Interpretation of Cultures,\u201d wrote that \u201cone of the most significant facts about us may finally be that we all begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand kinds of life but end in the end having lived only one.\u201d He cites the critic William Empson: \u201cThere is more in the child than any man has been able to keep.\u201d We have unlived lives for all sorts of reasons: because we make choices; because society constrains us; because events force our hand; most of all, because we are singular individuals, becoming more so with time. \u201cWhile growth realizes, it narrows,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cPlural possibilities simmer down.\u201d This is painful, but it\u2019s an odd kind of pain\u2014hypothetical, paradoxical. Even as we regret who we haven\u2019t become, we value who we are. We seem to find meaning in what\u2019s never happened. Our self-portraits use a lot of negative space.", "For some people, imagining unlived lives is torture, even a gateway to crisis. Miller tells the story of Spencer Brydon, the protagonist of Henry James\u2019s tale \u201cThe Jolly Corner.\u201d As a young man, Brydon left America for Europe, where he \u201cfollowed strange paths and worshiped strange gods,\u201d living as a playboy. Three decades later, he returns to New York, where he takes stock of his peers. Many of them are rich, powerful, or respected; they have built substantial lives. Brydon, who is single and only superficially accomplished, starts to wonder how he would have turned out if he\u2019d stayed. Would he have become a successful businessman? Married his friend Alice, with whom he\u2019s reconnected? He begins to spend his nights prowling the hallways of his childhood home, convinced that the ghost of the man he might have been wanders there. Eventually, he meets a version of himself: an apparitional Brydon, with a forbidding face and two missing fingers, who strides forward in \u201ca rage of personality.\u201d Watching him, Brydon faints. He wakes with his head cradled in Alice\u2019s lap, and realizes that he loves her: better this life than that one!", "Most of us aren\u2019t haunted so acutely by the people we might have been. But, perhaps for a morning or a month, our lives can still thrum with the knowledge that it could have been otherwise. \u201cYou may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife,\u201d David Byrne sings, in the Talking Heads song \u201cOnce in a Lifetime.\u201d \u201cAnd you may ask yourself, \u2018Well, how did I get here?\u2019 \u201d Maybe you feel suddenly pushed around by your life, and wonder if you could have willed it into a different shape. Perhaps you suddenly remember, as Hilary Mantel did, that you have another self \u201cfiled in a drawer of your consciousness, like a short story that wouldn\u2019t work after the opening lines.\u201d Today, your life is irritating, like an ill-fitting garment; you can\u2019t forget it\u2019s there. \u201cYou may tell yourself, \u2018This is not my beautiful house. . . . This is not my beautiful wife,\u2019 \u201d Byrne sings.", "We may imagine specific unlived lives for ourselves, as artists, or teachers, or tech bros; I have a lawyer friend whose alternate self owns a bar in Red Hook. Or we may just be drawn to possibility itself, as in the poem \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d: when Robert Frost tells us that choosing one path over the other made \u201call the difference,\u201d it doesn\u2019t matter what the difference is. Carl Dennis\u2019s poem \u201cThe God Who Loves You\u201d tries to make that difference concrete. Dennis poses a question to his protagonist, a middle-aged real-estate agent: \u201cWhat would have happened / Had you gone to your second choice for college\u201d? A different roommate, a different spouse, a different job: could it all have added up to \u201ca life thirty points above the life you\u2019re living / On any scale of satisfaction\u201d? Only \u201cthe god who loves you\u201d knows for sure. It\u2019s an unsettling thought; Dennis suggests that we pity that all-knowing god, \u201cpacing his cloudy bedroom, harassed by alternatives / You\u2019re spared by ignorance.\u201d", "Swept up in our real lives, we quickly forget about the unreal ones. Still, there will be moments when, for good or for ill, we feel confronted by our unrealized possibilities; they may even, through their persistence, shape us. Practitioners of mindfulness tell us that we should look away, returning our gaze to the actual, the here and now. But we might have the opposite impulse, as Miller does. He wants us to wander in the hall of mirrors\u2014to let our imagined selves \u201clinger longer and say more.\u201d What can our unreal selves say about our real ones?", "Their mere presence in our minds may reveal something about how we live: \u201cUnled lives are a largely modern preoccupation,\u201d Miller writes. It used to be that, for the most part, people lived the life their parents had, or the one that the fates decreed. Today, we try to chart our own courses. The difference is reflected in the stories we tell ourselves. In the Iliad, Achilles chooses between two clearly defined fates, designed by the gods and foretold in advance: he can either fight and die at Troy or live a long, boring life. (In the end, he chooses to fight.) But the world in which we live isn\u2019t so neatly organized. Achilles didn\u2019t have to wonder if he should have been pre-med or pre-law; we make such decisions knowing that they might shape our lives.", "Among secular people, the absence of an afterlife raises the stakes. In \u201cMissing Out: In Praise of the Unlived Life,\u201d the psychologist Adam Phillips warns that \u201conce the next life\u2014the better life, the fuller life\u2014has to be in this one, we have a considerable task on our hands.\u201d Given just a single shot at existence, we owe it to ourselves to hit the mark; we must not just survive but thrive. It\u2019s no wonder that for many of us \u201cthe story of our lives becomes the story of the lives we were prevented from living.\u201d", "It\u2019s likely, Miller thinks, that capitalism, \u201cwith its isolation of individuals and its accelerating generation of choices and chances,\u201d has increased the number of our unlived lives. \u201cThe elevation of choice as an absolute good, the experience of chance as a strange affront, the increasing number of exciting, stultifying decisions we must make, the review of the past to improve future outcomes\u201d\u2014all these \u201cfeed the people we\u2019re not.\u201d Advertisers sell us things by getting us to imagine better versions of ourselves, even though there\u2019s only one life to live: it\u2019s \u201cYOLO + FOMO,\u201d a friend tells Miller, summing up the situation nicely. The nature of work deepens the problem. \u201cUnlike the agricultural and industrial societies that preceded it,\u201d Miller writes, our \u201cprofessional society\u201d is \u201cmade up of specialized careers, ladders of achievement.\u201d You make your choice, forgoing others: year by year, you \u201cclamber up into your future,\u201d thinking back on the ladders unclimbed.", "Historic events generate unlived lives. Years from now, we may wonder where we would be if the coronavirus pandemic hadn\u2019t shifted us onto new courses. Sometimes we can see another life opening out to one side, like a freeway exit. Miller recounts the sad history of Jack and Ennis, the cowboys in Annie Proulx\u2019s story \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d who are in love but live in Wyoming in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, and so must hide it. They disagree about how to understand their predicament. Ennis has no \u201cserious hard feelings,\u201d Proulx tells us. \u201cJust a vague sense of getting short-changed.\u201d But Jack, Miller writes, \u201cis haunted by the lives they might have led together, running a little ranch or living in Mexico, somewhere away from civilization and its systematic and personal violence.\u201d Jack tells Ennis, \u201cWe could a had a good life together, a fuckin real good life.\u201d The existence he has is spoiled by the one he doesn\u2019t.", "It makes sense for Jack to dwell on how things might have turned out in a better world. And yet we can have the same kinds of thoughts even when we\u2019re basically happy with our lives. The philosopher Charles Taylor, who has written much about the history of selfhood, has a theory about why we can\u2019t just accept the way things are: he thinks that sometime toward the end of the eighteenth century two big trends in our self-understanding converged. We learned to think of ourselves as \u201cdeep\u201d individuals, with hidden wellsprings of feeling and talent that we owed it to ourselves to find. At the same time, we came to see ourselves objectively\u2014as somewhat interchangeable members of the same species and of a competitive mass society. Subjectivity and objectivity both grew more intense. We came to feel that our lives, pictured from the outside, failed to reflect the vibrancy within."], "authors": ["Joshua Rothman", "Joshua Rothma"], "keywords": ["work", "writes", "miller", "unlived", "tells", "wonder", "lives", "live", "office", "life"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
