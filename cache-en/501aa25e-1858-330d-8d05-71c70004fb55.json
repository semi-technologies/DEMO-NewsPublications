It found that 73% of surveyed forecasters say the economy will return to its pre-pandemic level by late 2021.

Even if a vaccine gets approved quickly, it would be scarce at first and most people wouldn't be able to get one for a while.

Momentum on Capitol Hill for a potential deal seemed to have accelerated in recent days, but bitter partisanship has prevented Democrats and Republicans for months from delivering more aid to laid-off workers and industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic.", "Slightly more than a quarter of forecasters surveyed by NABE, 27%, said the biggest risk facing the economy is inaction by Washington to offer more financial aid.
