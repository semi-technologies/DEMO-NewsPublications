It has also been one of the most abused. No state has been as undemocratic or unpopular as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola has paid more attention to liberating the country\u2019s assets into its leaders\u2019 foreign bank accounts than to freeing Angolans from the oppression of poverty. In the media the formula signals a determination to ignore popular taste: the People\u2019s Daily makes no more effort to appeal to its Chinese readers than Pravda did to tell the truth to its Soviet ones. So when Downing Street frames the election Britons are expecting as \u201cParliament versus the people\u201d, the people should beware.", "References to \u201cthe people\u201d are standard fare in political speech. Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, likes to bang on about the mandat du peuple, and the responsibility it confers. This is fine; the danger arises when \u201cthe people\u201d are weaponised against a supposed enemy.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "It is not just politicians who do this. Princess Diana said she wanted to be the \u201cqueen of people\u2019s hearts\u201d\u2014in implied contrast to the awkward husband who commanded the affections of nobody but his mistress. But with the rise of populism, the tactic is spreading among politicians. Sometimes the enemy is a foreign one. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela\u2019s late demagogue, called on the people to resist \u201cthe empire\u201d\u2014George W. Bush was unpopular worldwide, and thus a convenient target. Today Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador ( AMLO ), unwilling to antagonise his northern neighbour, prefers the vaguer \u201cmafia of power\u201d. Sometimes it is a religious minority, such as Muslims, who are clearly excluded from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s celebration of its success in India \u201cin inciting amongst the people a desire for a unique cultural Indic renaissance\u201d. Any of these foes may be used to whip up support for a struggling politician.", "But the target is usually the institutions that stand in the politician\u2019s way, especially the legislature, the courts and the media. Such checks and balances are essential to the proper workings of a democracy but, inevitably, inconvenient for presidents and prime ministers who are not particular about the means they use to achieve their ends. President Donald Trump has referred to the media as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d; Poland\u2019s ruling PIS party justifies its attacks on the legal system and the opposition by reference to its connection to the narod; Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s prime minister, has set himself up as defending the will of \u201cthe people\u201d against those in Parliament and the courts who are stopping Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal.", "Once a politician has defined those who elected him as \u201cthe people\u201d, then he embodies their will and it is but a short step to defining his own enemies as the nation\u2019s. After Polish MP s called for an EU investigation of their government, the prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, called them traitors. Mr Johnson calls a law designed to avoid a chaotic departure from the EU \u201cthe Surrender Act\u201d, and accuses its supporters of \u201ccollaboration\u201d. Mr Trump tweets that \u201cwhat is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!\u201d", "If \u201cthe people\u201d are thwarted by the courts or parliament, they may be driven to unconstitutional action. That\u2019s what some Britons thought the Conservative Party chairman meant when he said that, if they were denied Brexit, they would \u201clook at other ways of initiating change\u201d. And it is what some Americans concluded when Mr Trump retweeted a pastor\u2019s warning that impeachment would \u201ccause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation\u201d. If \u201cthe people\u201d take matters into their own hands, what is a president to do? At a recent press conference, AMLO declared, \u201cI believe that not only you\u2019re good journalists but you\u2019re also prudent...And if you cross the line, well, you know what happens, right? But it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s the people.\u201d He did not specify what the people might do, but Mexico\u2019s journalists understand the risks: 12 have been murdered this year.", "Voters should keep an ear cocked for this dangerous phrase.
