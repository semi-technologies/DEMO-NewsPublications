Thus America or Japan can get away with fast-and-loose economic policies that would spell disaster if less mature, \u201cemerging\u201d economies tried them at home. Quantitative easing ( QE ) is often cited as an example. Buying government bonds with newly created money is surely the kind of indulgence best left to the rich world. Central banks in emerging markets have, after all, spent decades trying to distance themselves from gluttonous governments and prove themselves careful stewards of the money supply.", "The emerging-market response to the covid-19 pandemic has, therefore, raised eyebrows. As well as cutting interest rates sharply, many central banks have experimented with their own versions of QE , buying government bonds and other financial assets. Contrary to some fears, this has not so far brought disaster. Indeed the early evidence suggests it has worked quite well.", "At least 18 central banks have carried out asset-purchase programmes of some kind, according to the IMF . Policymakers in some countries, such as Chile, Hungary and Poland, resorted to them because they had already lowered interest rates about as far as they could go. Others, however, had different motives. In some countries the authorities admitted that bond-buying had a partly fiscal aim. The central bank\u2019s purchases would help finance the government\u2019s efforts to fight the pandemic. The Bank of Ghana, bought a \u201ccovid-19 relief bond\u201d worth 5.5bn cedi ($950m) from the government in May to help fill its financing gap. In the Philippines, Rosalia De Leon, the national treasurer, described the central bank\u2019s purchases as an \u201cextra lifeline\u201d for the government.", "A third group of central banks, including those in India and South Africa, bought bonds for a subtler reason: to help make a market for them. Their aim was not simply to lift bond prices, but also to reduce their volatility and narrow a widening gap between the prices demanded by prospective sellers and those offered by potential buyers. In addition, by acting as a buyer of last resort, central bankers hoped to embolden other, private buyers of earlier resort."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["bonds", "pandemic", "badly", "purchases", "turned", "central", "rates", "markets", "encouraging", "emerging", "resort", "help", "experiments", "banks", "quite", "qe", "prices"], "pubDate": "2020-10-29T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
