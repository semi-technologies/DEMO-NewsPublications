After the turmoil of the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests, amid the upheaval of the coronavirus crisis and less than two years from a probable re-election bid, he cannot afford a mistake.", "\u201cIt would be naive to believe we would reach this stage of the talks without domestic politics intruding,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, of the European Policy Centre thinktank. \u201cBut this is the case not just for France \u2013 and on the key issues in these talks, there is agreement across EU capitals.\u201d", "Nathalie Loiseau, a former Europe minister and now an MEP, said the British \u201calways expect to divide Europe, and it never works. Now we have this \u2018good cop, bad cop\u2019 scenario: Germany supposedly wants a deal at any price, and France is the tough guy.\u201d", "In fact, Loiseau said, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had consistently denied this was her aim. \u201cAs for France,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have this role, maybe because our relations with the UK are so intense, of speaking for the others \u2013 sometimes loudly.\u201d", "Nothing France has so far said about the future trade deal \u2013 including its key demand that British companies can expect preferential access to Europe\u2019s single market only if they obey its rules \u2013 \u201chas been contradicted by a single other member state\u201d, she said. \u201cSo there is a lot of noise, propaganda. But the EU is really not divided.\u201d", "Georgina Wright, a Europe specialist at the Institute for Government, agreed that \u201cif France were the only member state to have concerns and reservations, we would be a lot closer to a deal than we are now\u201d.", "France is \u201cvery, very concerned about this trade deal\u201d, Wright said. \u201cIt wants one that will stand the test of time, that won\u2019t give UK companies an unfair competitive advantage in the European market down the line. And it is far from alone.\u201d", "Zuleeg also said Paris was \u201ccertainly not isolated\u201d. Concerns about the level playing field, governance and \u201cthe level of trust that the EU can have in Britain\u201d are felt keenly in every capital, he said: \u201cOn these core concerns I see no gap between them.\u201d", "That is not to say that individual EU countries do not have specific concerns, Zuleeg said. Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, France\u2019s Europe minister, has warned France could veto a bad deal \u2013 stressing its demand for \u201cbroad and lasting\u201d access by its fishermen to British waters, a question as sensitive in France as it is in the UK.", "But it is \u201cnot accurate\u201d to characterise France\u2019s position as being only, or even mainly, about fishing, Zuleeg said. The difference, said Wright, was perhaps that France was \u201cquite happy to take the blame \u2013 and that equally, other member states are quite happy for France to do so.\u201d", "In a meeting with Michel Barnier last Wednesday, France\u2019s EU ambassador, Philippe L\u00e9glise-Costa, was backed by counterparts from Ireland, Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark in voicing concern that the EU\u2019s chief negotiator risked exceeding the bounds of his mandate.", "\u201cPlenty of countries are nervous,\u201d an EU diplomat said. \u201cIt\u2019s essential the substance of the deal takes precedence over the calendar. We cannot give in to the clock; we must get a deal that defends our collective interests. A bad deal poses fundamental risks to the EU in 10 years\u2019 time. We are all with the French on this.\u201d", "Beaune conceded on Sunday there were \u201cdifferent concerns\u201d within the EU27, saying it would be \u201cnaive to deny it\u201d. But he said Barnier\u2019s mandate was detailed and \u201cwe are sticking to it. The main players have all realigned behind the same position. There is unity on the message and on the strategy.\u201d", "Merkel \u201calso defends our demands\u201d, Beaune said. \u201cShe knows the European market well enough to guess how the German economy would suffer from a bad agreement. The UK\u2019s gamble on a split in the EU has failed.\u201d"], "authors": ["Jon Henley", "John Crace"], "keywords": ["brexit", "wright", "zuleeg", "talks", "france", "european", "deal", "stance", "far", "isolated", "tough", "concerns", "bad", "europe", "eu"], "pubDate": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
