She is there to take part in a planning session for a school fund-raiser, a meeting that devolves into a bitch sesh quicker than anyone can say \u201cclassic eight.\u201d \u201cDid you see the David Hockneys?\u201d one woman asks, referring to the home of apparently even-richer school parents, where the fund-raiser is set to take place. \u201cTwo of them, on facing walls in the dining room,\u201d another mom answers, as a uniformed maid serves tea.", "Like \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d with which it shares David E. Kelley as creator, \u201cThe Undoing\u201d has great fun telegraphing the signifiers of wealth. The former show, set in the casual luxury of Monterey, was full of crackling fire pits, double-height living rooms, and rustic decks overlooking expanses of pristine shoreline. Here, we get full-bore Upper East Side resplendence, where cashmere-clad, preternaturally smooth-complexioned women convene in marble-and-gilt rooms so laden with precious objets that they could double as the Met\u2019s Wrightsman Galleries.", "The fund-raiser these women are working on will solicit money for the school\u2019s diversity efforts, to cover tuition for students who are neither rich nor white. The mother of one such student has joined the planning committee. Her name is Elena Alves, and, although she is played by the Italian actress Matilda De Angelis, the show uses establishing shots of Elena\u2019s apartment in Spanish Harlem to suggest that her character is Latina. Elena has ostensibly come to the meeting to help, but the awkwardness her presence arouses suggests these rich white mothers\u2019 allegiance to what Dickens once called \u201ctelescopic philanthropy,\u201d the kind of benevolence that, tinged by racism and classism, works best from a safe distance. In the scene\u2019s climax, the ladies are both horrified and titillated when Elena drops her top to begin nursing her infant daughter at the table, like a sensual Madonna. \u201cSpectacular breasts,\u201d Grace\u2019s friend Sylvia (Lily Rabe) says later, snickering.", "\u201cThe Undoing\u201d is not subtle, which at first I didn\u2019t mind. The pilot episode hit the exact pleasure center between mild critique and life-style porn. Grace is a successful therapist and the daughter of a leonine billionaire (Donald Sutherland); her husband, Jonathan (Hugh Grant), is a pediatric oncologist who has been featured in New York magazine\u2019s \u201cBest Doctors\u201d issue. As I began watching, the show seemed well positioned to skewer its subjects while allowing the viewer to revel in the flashier aspects of their lives\u2014a \u201cPrimates of Park Avenue\u201d for the city\u2019s eleventh-hour pre-pandemic moment.", "But, much like the appearance of a soothsaying gypsy in a Victorian novel, the mysterious Elena, with her provocative air and accented English, portends the switch from light satire to melodrama. At the fund-raiser\u2014just after a glass of water has been auctioned off for a thousand dollars, as a show of the parents\u2019 commitment to the cause\u2014Elena decides to go home early. The next morning, she is found dead, bludgeoned by a hammer in her studio. (She is, apparently, an artist, though this detail remains abstract, as does almost everything else about the character.) Jonathan is arrested; it turns out that he was having an affair with Elena, who might have become obsessed with him after he treated her older child for cancer, and circumstantial evidence has made him the main suspect in the case. He is also unable to afford a lawyer\u2014he emptied his coffers while wooing Elena. \u201cYour husband is a bit of a dick,\u201d Jonathan\u2019s public defender tells Grace, suggesting that, although his client might be bad, he is no killer.", "Could Jonathan be guilty? He is presented in the pilot episode not as a psychopath, or even as a dick, but as an irresistibly crinkly-eyed, slightly roguish man who cajoles Grace into sex by saying things like \u201cMake an Englishman happy.\u201d He is, in other words, a Hugh Grant character. But his affair and his potentially murderous impulses are reminiscent of one Grant character in particular\u2014the charming, conspiring politician Jeremy Thorpe in 2018\u2019s \u201cA Very English Scandal.\u201d", "It may feel as if you\u2019ve seen a lot of these characters\u2014and plot points, and framing devices\u2014recently. \u201cThe Undoing,\u201d though conceived as a whodunnit, is much less interested in Elena and her killer than it is in Grace\u2019s internal landscape. The show is the latest in a long tradition devoted to examining the shadowy psychic crevices of high-strung, upper-class white women, calling back to the Lifetime movie, and to steamy eighties and nineties dramas such as \u201cBasic Instinct,\u201d \u201cThe Hand That Rocks the Cradle,\u201d and \u201cFatal Attraction.\u201d (A friend who works as a development executive told me that such content is known in industry parlance as \u201cAdrian Lyne and wine,\u201d after the director of the last movie.)", "Some of the most recent TV efforts, glossy things starring A-list actresses, include the Amy Adams-led \u201cSharp Objects\u201d (which, like \u201cThe Undoing,\u201d has a gruesome act of violence at its core) and the Naomi Watts vehicle \u201cGypsy\u201d (which features a therapist protagonist). Earlier this year came \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere,\u201d starring Reese Witherspoon, three years after the aforementioned \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d which, as in a game of prestige-TV musical chairs, stars not only Witherspoon but Kidman as well. All of these shows evince an ongoing negotiation between the sociopolitical and the operatically psychological. But \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d\u2014a show in which the life of a wealthy white mom becomes intertwined with that of a working-class artist of color\u2014at least makes an attempt to contend with some of the questions of race and class that it raises. In \u201cThe Undoing,\u201d such questions are made irrelevant by the decision to kill Elena off almost immediately. One is left wondering why the show bothered to introduce her at all.", "David E. Kelley\u2019s most notable early success was that landmark of post-feminism \u201cAlly McBeal,\u201d the late-nineties network dramedy that focussed on the spectacle of a woman dithering between mating and career within the stage set of the modern workplace. In comparison, Grace, even though she is an accomplished therapist, seems largely post-work. Part of the pleasure of shows like \u201cThe Undoing\u201d is their characters\u2019 relative financial freedom, which allows them the time to do things such as plan a fund-raiser or, perhaps, a murder.", "Dressed in jewel-toned velvets, with her long auburn ringlets streaming down her back, Grace has the look of a Pre-Raphaelite heroine, wandering the city streets in a daze, her cape-like coat flapping, the muddled, soft-focus haze of the show\u2019s cinematography reflecting her tortured mental state. In a cliffhanger in the show\u2019s third episode, the hunky detective investigating Elena\u2019s murder (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez) provides evidence that Grace might be involved in the crime\u2014a possibility that appears to come as a surprise to Grace herself, and that hints at the limits of the therapist\u2019s self-knowledge. This mystery, however, stretches wearyingly along the show\u2019s course, turning from a suspenseful device to something that suggests Grace\u2019s characterological thinness.", "Who is this woman? Kidman\u2019s character in \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Celeste, was also an enigma, but the actress played the role with such restraint that Celeste\u2019s opacity felt deliberate. As Grace, Kidman seems, at times, unsure of her own character\u2019s intentions, shifting from blithe merriment to imperious boss-lady outbursts to turned-up-to-eleven distress. Beset by hazy visions of events that she might or might not have actually seen\u2014Elena and Jonathan making passionate love, Jonathan joshingly caring for one of his young cancer patients, Elena attacked with a hammer\u2014Grace\u2019s mind seems less a site of internal conflict than a repository of televisual clich\u00e9s. In these moments, the camera closes in tightly on Kidman\u2019s lovely eyes, as if the answer can be found in their cloudy depths. It cannot. \u2666"], "authors": ["Naomi Fry", "Naomi Fr"], "keywords": ["character", "undoing", "jonathan", "fundraiser", "porn", "women", "lifestyle", "little", "shows", "elena", "white", "grace"], "pubDate": "2020-11-16T00:00:00", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
