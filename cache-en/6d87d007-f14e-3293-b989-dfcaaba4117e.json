Reading from a sheaf of prepared papers, she asked Jack Dorsey, the C.E.O. of Twitter, whether his company was doing enough to stem the spread of disinformation. Elaborating, she read in full a tweet that President Trump had disseminated on November 7th, falsely claiming to have won the Presidential election. She then asked Dorsey if Twitter\u2019s labelling of the tweet as disputed had adequately alerted readers that it was a bald lie.", "It was a good question. Feinstein seemed sharp and focussed. For decades, she has been the epitome of a female trailblazer in Washington, always hyper-prepared. But this time, after Dorsey responded, Feinstein asked him the same question again, reading it word for word, along with the Trump tweet. Her inflection was eerily identical. Feinstein looked and sounded just as authoritative, seemingly registering no awareness that she was repeating herself verbatim. Dorsey graciously answered the question all over again.", "Social media was less polite. A conservative Web site soon posted a clip of the humiliating moment on YouTube, under the headline \u201cSenator Feinstein just asked the same question twice and didn\u2019t realize she did it,\u201d adding an emoji of someone covering his face with his hand in shame, along with bright red type proclaiming \u201cTime to Retire!!\u201d Six days later, under growing pressure from progressive groups who were already outraged by her faltering management of Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Feinstein released a statement announcing that she would step down from the Democrats\u2019 senior position, while continuing as a non-ranking member of the committee. Feinstein\u2019s office declined to comment for this article.", "Feinstein first became nationally known for the grit she showed in 1978, when her fellow San Francisco city officials Harvey Milk and George Moscone were shot dead. She has had a distinguished twenty-eight-year tenure in the Senate, taking on a range of powerful interests, from gun-rights groups to the C.I.A. The moment marked a sad turning point for Feinstein and a reckoning for the Senate, which runs on the seniority system. The presumption has been that it\u2019s up to voters to fire aging senators who can no longer effectively serve. But voters rarely do. As Paul Kane, who covers Congress for the Washington Post, wrote in 2017, the Senate was then the oldest in history. Its eight octogenarians were almost twice the number that had simultaneously served before. According to the Senate Historical Office, all of them held positions of vital importance to the country. And while several were regarded as wise and effective, others had disruptive health problems that clearly undermined the Senate\u2019s ability to function.", "Twitter and other social-media platforms are exposing lawmakers\u2019 infirmities to new and harsher scrutiny, violating an unspoken culture of complicity and coverup. Prior to the recent re\u00eblection of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Internet was ablaze with close-up photos of his bandaged, purple hands, setting off wild speculation about the health of the seventy-eight-year-old Republican from Kentucky. The physical and mental fitness of Trump, who is seventy-four, and Joe Biden, who is seventy-eight, have also been extensively covered. \u201cIn the 24/7 news cycle we have now, you can\u2019t really hide,\u201d one former top aide to Feinstein told me.", "Some former Feinstein aides insist that rumors of her cognitive decline have been exaggerated, and that video clips taken out of context can make almost anyone look foolish. They also bridle at singling out her condition, because declining male senators, including Strom Thurmond, of South Carolina, and Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, were widely known by the end of their careers to be non-compos mentis. \u201cFor his last ten years, Strom Thurmond didn\u2019t know if he was on foot or on horseback,\u201d one former Senate aide told me. The former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, of Nevada, is said to have snapped at a staffer who claimed to be relaying what Byrd thought. \u201cKnock it off,\u201d Reid supposedly said. \u201cEveryone knows it\u2019s what you think.\u201d In contrast, one former aide to Feinstein argues that, even if her faculties are diminished, \u201cshe\u2019s still smarter and quicker than at least a third of the other members.\u201d", "But many others familiar with Feinstein\u2019s situation describe her as seriously struggling, and say it has been evident for several years. Speaking on background, and with respect for her accomplished career, they say her short-term memory has grown so poor that she often forgets she has been briefed on a topic, accusing her staff of failing to do so just after they have. They describe Feinstein as forgetting what she has said and getting upset when she can\u2019t keep up. One aide to another senator described what he called a \u201cKabuki\u201d meeting in which Feinstein\u2019s staff tried to steer her through a proposed piece of legislation that she protested was \u201cjust words\u201d which \u201cmake no sense.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s staff has said that sometimes she seems herself, and other times unreachable. \u201cThe staff is in such a bad position,\u201d a former Senate aide who still has business in Congress said. \u201cThey have to defend her and make her seem normal.\u201d", "Feinstein has always been known as a difficult taskmaster. She is said to have told someone applying for a job in her office, \u201cI don\u2019t get ulcers\u2014I give them.\u201d A stickler for detail, she demanded to see every page going out of her office with her name on it. But with her diminishing capacity, this has become increasingly difficult. The former Senate staffer who still works with Congress declared, \u201cIt\u2019s been a disaster.\u201d As the ranking Democrat, Feinstein ordinarily would be expected to run the Party\u2019s strategy on issues of major national importance, including judicial nominations. Instead, the committee has been hamstrung and disorganized. \u201cOther members were constantly trying to go around her because, as chair, she didn\u2019t want to do anything, and she also didn\u2019t want them doing anything,\u201d the former Senate staffer said. A current aide to a different Democratic senator observed sadly, \u201cShe\u2019s an incredibly effective human being, but there\u2019s definitely been deterioration in the last year. She\u2019s in a very different mode now.\u201d", "Tensions began erupting in the summer of 2018, during Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, when the other Democrats on the committee belatedly learned that Feinstein\u2019s office had sat on Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegation that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school, instead of immediately alerting them or the F.B.I. Ford had demanded that Feinstein keep the explosive charge confidential. But, inevitably, word of it leaked elsewhere to the media, triggering a second round of circus-like hearings that angered all sides.", "The internal criticism grew more intense this fall over Feinstein\u2019s handling of Amy Coney Barrett. Feinstein had bungled a question about abortion during Barrett\u2019s 2017 appeals-court confirmation hearing, provoking conservative indignation by casting it clumsily as a question about Barrett\u2019s extreme religious beliefs. \u201cDogma and law are two different things,\u201d Feinstein observed. \u201cThe dogma lives loudly in you\u2014and that\u2019s a concern.\u201d The backlash over the question effectively indemnified Barrett from any further questions about how her faith affected her judicial rulings.", "According to several sources, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Minority Leader, was so worried that Feinstein would mismanage Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings that he installed a trusted former aide, Max Young, to \u201cembed\u201d in the Judiciary Committee to make sure the hearings didn\u2019t go off the rails. He had done the same during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation as well. Schumer brought Young in from the gun-control group Everytown to handle strategy and communications and serve as Schumer\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears\u201d on Feinstein, as one Senate source put it. Schumer\u2019s office declined to comment.", "The precaution nonetheless failed. The Democrats\u2019 strategy was to portray Barrett\u2019s confirmation process as a travesty, jammed through the Senate in the final weeks before the Presidential election by hypocritical Republicans bent on using brute power to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with her ideological polar opposite. The Democrats sought to fire up their voters by highlighting the illegitimacy of the process. But, to the Democrats\u2019 dismay, Feinstein instead hugged the Republican chairman of the committee, Lindsey Graham, thanking him for his \u201cfairness\u201d and for running \u201cone of the best set of hearings that I\u2019ve participated in.\u201d", "By the end of the confirmation hearings, public-opinion polls showed more support for Barrett than before they began. Progressive advocacy groups demanded that Feinstein step aside. Ilyse Hogue, the president of the reproductive-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, issued a statement accusing her of having failed to make clear that Barrett posed \u201ca grave threat\u201d to \u201cevery freedom and right we hold dear.\u201d Instead, Hogue said, Feinstein had \u201coffered an appearance of credibility to the proceedings that is wildly out of step with the American people. As such, we believe the committee needs new leadership.\u201d Brian Fallon, the executive director of the progressive advocacy group Demand Justice, who was a former aide to Schumer, was even more blunt. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Senator Feinstein to step down from her leadership position on the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she won\u2019t, her colleagues need to intervene.\u201d"], "authors": ["Jane Mayer", "Jane Maye", "Connie Bruc"], "keywords": ["senate", "dianne", "democrats", "feinstein", "office", "committee", "painful", "question", "age", "aide", "confirmation", "missteps", "feinsteins", "didnt", "hearings", "raise"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
