Johnny Marks, who made millions from \u201cRudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\u201d griped in his later years, \u201cThis is not exactly what I hoped to be remembered for.\u201d (Too bad; \u201cRudolph\u201d was in the headline of his Times obituary.) Jos\u00e9 Feliciano has no ambivalence about \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d his bilingual earworm from 1970. He is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary with a live-streamed concert, a children\u2019s book, a line of branded Teddy bears, and a re-recording featuring artists such as Lin-Manuel Miranda, Michael Bolton, and La India. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to hear a lot of ka-ching!\u201d he said recently.", "Jos\u00e9 Feliciano Illustration by Jo\u00e3o Fazenda", "Feliciano was at home in Connecticut, where he lives in an eighteenth-century former tavern. \u201cHe had his shirt off this morning, sitting out in the sun with his oatmeal,\u201d his wife, Susan, said. When a visitor arrived, Feliciano was clothed (black shirt, black mask, black sunglasses) and listening to music on his porch, as his son Jonnie stacked firewood. Feliciano, who was born blind, is seventy-five, diminutive, and a punster. Susan guided him to a red barn, where he has a recording studio festooned with gold records and guitars, and he sank into an armchair. His first memories of Navidad are from his childhood in Puerto Rico, where he was one of eleven boys. \u201cWe had no septic tanks or anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to rat on my father, but he stole chickens, and I told my parents that I was going to study chickens\u2014at Perdue University!\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t encourage him,\u201d Susan said.", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re blind, you\u2019d better have a sense of humor, because you get a lot of jerks in your path,\u201d he went on. \u201cLike, \u2018What\u2019s the matter? You blind or something?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, what\u2019s your excuse?\u2019 \u201d His family moved to Spanish Harlem when he was five, and he left home at eighteen, to make it as a singer in Greenwich Village. In 1968, he released his hit cover of \u201cLight My Fire\u201d and caused a firestorm by putting a folksy spin on \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the World Series. One day in 1970, he and his producer, Rick Jarrard, were planning a holiday album at Feliciano\u2019s place in California, in a room with some squawking parrots. \u201cRick said, \u2018Jos\u00e9, I think it\u2019s time for a new Christmas song.\u2019 Because the last huge one was \u2018Rockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree,\u2019 by Brenda Lee.\u201d Feliciano added as an aside, \u201cWhen I was a kid, I had a mad crush on Brenda Lee.\u201d Then he crooned a bit of \u201cAll Alone Am I.\u201d", "He wrote \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d in ten minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s the simplest song ever written,\u201d he said. \u201cNineteen words to it\u201d\u2014six in Spanish (\u201cFeliz Navidad, pr\u00f3spero a\u00f1o y felicidad\u201d) and thirteen in English (\u201cI wanna wish you a merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart\u201d), repeated ad nauseam. \u201cI wanted a song that belonged to the masses,\u201d he recalled. He and Jarrard recorded it at RCA studios, on Sunset Boulevard, in a single take. \u201cIf you know where your song is going to go, you don\u2019t have to fuck around with it too much,\u201d Feliciano said, letting out a hoot. \u201cI used to say to myself, \u2018Joke \u2019em if they can\u2019t take a fuck!\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cO.K., that\u2019s twice,\u201d Susan chided him.", "He recorded the track with the Brazilian drummer Paulinho Magalh\u00e3es, accompanying himself on bass and the cuatro, a ten-string mahogany instrument his uncle had given him. The song drew on Spanish Christmas carols, known as villancicos. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a joke that will illustrate it better,\u201d Feliciano said. \u201cThree people die, and on their way to Heaven St. Peter stops them and says, \u2018I need something from each of you that reminds you of Christmas.\u2019 \u201d The first man takes out a lighter, signifying candles. The second shakes some keys, like bells. The third displays a pair of women\u2019s panties. \u201cSt. Peter says, \u2018How do these remind you of Christmas?\u2019 And he goes, \u2018These are Carol\u2019s!\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cThat is terrible, Jos\u00e9,\u201d Susan said. When \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d came out, Feliciano was still married to his first wife, Hilda, and Susan was a high-school student in Detroit who had started a Jos\u00e9 Feliciano fan club. \u201cInstead of taking the bus home, I took it downtown to the department store, where I knew they\u2019d have the new album,\u201d she recalled. The song became a crossover hit; Feliciano bought himself a Cadillac Eldorado. (\u201cI wanted to be like Elvis,\u201d he said.) Does anyone ever complain to him about the way it lodges itself in one\u2019s brain? \u201cSometimes Texans come up to me, and they\u2019ll say\u201d\u2014he broke into a Yosemite Sam accent\u2014\u201c \u2018Hey, is yer name Jos\u00e9 Felicianer?\u2019 And I\u2019ll say, \u2018Yes, it is.\u2019 \u2018Well, I jus\u2019 want you to know, I lurve that Christmas song that you wrote. It\u2019s in my head, and I cain\u2019t ever get rid of it.\u2019 \u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a true story,\u201d Susan said, and guided him back to the house. \u2666"], "authors": ["Michael Schulman", "Michael Schulma"], "keywords": ["anniversary", "susan", "fiftieth", "written", "jos\u00e9", "feliz", "song", "thats", "spanish", "simplest", "navidad", "christmas", "recalled", "feliciano"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
