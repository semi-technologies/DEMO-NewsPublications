Our Democrat areas have already violated the law. It's on camera. You have court orders in Philadelphia allowing, by federal law, pollwatchers from both sides. If this is all on the up and up, if you're saying that, yes, President Trump, who was up fifteen points on election night by nearly 700,000 votes. Oh, but there were just enough ballots in Philadelphia and the surrounding counties to close that gap. OK, you should be proud of your voters, right? You should be proud of that miraculous victory, Joe Biden. Let's shine the light. Why are they breaking the law and not letting pollwatchers in? Well, everyone knows exactly why, and that's why we're fighting them. This is such a fraud. This is so crooked. And we're so sick and tired of it. This is an injustice and we're not going to be denied the truth.\""], "authors": ["Jon Costantino"], "keywords": ["embed", "harrington", "liz", "law", "philadelphia", "bidens", "victory", "shine", "light", "lead", "pollwatchers", "joe", "need", "proud"], "pubDate": "2020-11-06T00:00:00", "publicationId": "16476dca-59ce-395e-b896-050080120cd4"}
