Do you have any tips?", "Elizabeth, Wigton", "What Christmas looks like this year is anybody\u2019s guess, but at least we know there will be cake \u2013 even if you\u2019re gluten-free. Elizabeth\u2019s husband just needs a recipe with \u201ctons of fruit and very little flour\u201d, says baking oracle Dan Lepard, because they\u2019re the easiest to translate.", "Which gluten-free flour you choose, however, is up for debate. \u201cIt\u2019s so rich and moist, just having a bit of store-bought gluten-free flour mix would work really well,\u201d says Claire Ptak, founder of east London bakery Violet. Lepard recommends a gluten-free bread flour, for a cake that slices better. \u201cUse a brown bread mix,\u201d he adds. \u201cThese darker mixes have a much rounder flavour and are less chalky-tasting.\u201d", "Ravneet Gill\u2019s gluten-free flour education started with Phil Vickery\u2019s Gluten-Free Baking book. \u201cMy mum is coeliac and Phil\u2019s book has been a massive help in understanding flour combinations in baking,\u201d says the author of The Pastry Chef\u2019s Guide. Vickery makes his own flour mixes and, for his Christmas cake recipe on Vickery TV, uses a cornmeal, brown rice flour and cornflour combo. However, Doves Farm\u2019s gluten-free plain and self-raising flours are a firm favourite in the Gill household: \u201cYou can just sub them in almost equally in a recipe,\u201d she says.", "Lepard adds one teaspoon of psyllium husk, or two teaspoons of ground chia seeds, for every 200g flour. This, he says, will add \u201ca slight roughness to the texture and stop the starches compacting during baking\u201d. Vickery\u2019s top texture tip, meanwhile, is to soak the dried fruit and mixed peel in whisky and lemon juice overnight.", "Next, the bake. You want the centre of the cake to be rather dry. Lepard explains: \u201cThe typical starches used in gluten-free baking require more heat for longer to give a cooked texture.\u201d", "But why stop at Christmas cake? Coconut macaroons are a stalwart at Violet \u2013 \u201cThey look snowbally,\u201d Ptak says \u2013 and are naturally gluten-free. She mixes egg whites, caster sugar, salt, honey, desiccated coconut and vanilla extract in a heavy-based pan until melted. \u201cIt thickens and gets kind of dry,\u201d she says, \u201cthen scoop out individual portions and bake until puffed and golden.\u201d They\u2019ll keep for up to a week, too.", "Gill also goes for the double with a twice-baked chocolate cake, a recipe she learned at St John. Again, it happens to be gluten-free, which, let\u2019s face it, makes life easier. The secret to this five-ingredient cake (dark chocolate, butter, eggs, caster sugar, cocoa powder) is to over-bake the bottom and under-bake the top.", "Otherwise, look for egg white or nut-based biscuits. For Ptak, this means \u201cBarbados cookies\u201d, which are along the lines of analmond macaroon made with brown muscovado sugar, lots of pecans and dark chocolate.", "\u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
