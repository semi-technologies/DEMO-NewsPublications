The programme is designed to prepare participants to make sense of dynamic and unpredictable environments. It encourages them to engage stakeholders such as partners, clients, suppliers and regulators in more effective strategic conversations and to link scenario work to other processes in their organisations.", "Rafael is known as a founding father of theories on the aesthetics (attractiveness or repulsion) of business, work and organisation. Being one of the first in the world to publish on this topic and the first to write a thesis on aesthetics at a major American business school, his work has contributed to changes in the way business is appreciated and defined. Rafael has now written a large number of published papers, books and chapters on this topic, which challenge different aspects of how business is experienced, from the way conference rooms are set up to business language and corporate architecture.", "A proven innovator, Rafael co-authored the first major journal articles attacking the \u2018value chain\u2019 view of value production (with R. Normann), published in the Harvard Business Review in 1993. This pioneering research provided an alternative way of conceptualising value creation and redefined services as a way of creating value and not as a different sector of the economy. This he further developed in a paper in the Strategic Management Review (1999) on value co-production.", "As a researcher, consultant and management educator, Rafael has worked in over 25 countries, with many corporations, governmental and inter-governmental organisations, trade union federations, NGO's and professional associations.
