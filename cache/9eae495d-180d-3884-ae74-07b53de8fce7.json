Until the 19th century, parliamentarians were a rowdy bunch, challenging each other to duels over matters including the pronunciation of a Greek word, whether a window should be open or shut, and an insult to a dog. It is only since the dawn of the 20th century that physical fights among MP s have declined, in part because violence came to be associated less with aristocratic honour than with the lower classes.", "Yet just as the danger to MP s from each other, and from state authorities, began to recede, a growing threat emerged from another source: the people in whose name they governed. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, a quarter of all incidents of violence or threatened use of force against MP s involved members of the public. In the 20th century that jumped to nearly two-thirds. Over the past 19 years the proportion stands at three-quarters, according to data gathered by Eugene Wolfe, the author of \u201cDangerous Seats\u201d, a new book on parliamentary violence in Britain (see chart). Until the 19th century it was typically angry mobs that set upon politicians. Since the 20th, violence has tended to come from individuals or organised groups.", "Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "The first such campaign was organised by the suffragettes, who knocked politicians\u2019 hats off, attacked them with whips and hatchets, and threw bricks into Downing Street. Measured by the number of attacks on parliamentarians, rather than by their severity, the suffragettes were more active even than Irish republicans.", "Two parallel trends contributed to the rise of these \u201coutsider\u201d attacks on MP s. The first was the rise of constituency surgeries, which exposed politicians to their electorate more frequently and intimately than in the past. The second was the use of violence as a tactic to attract media attention to a cause\u2014what the suffragettes started, Fathers4Justice and other fringe groups have carried on. \u201cThe irony,\u201d says Mr Wolfe, is that \u201cpeople are less tolerant of violence than they used to be, but they make an exception for politicians.\u201d", "Much of this has been relatively harmless: eggs, flour bombs, custard pies and chocolate \u00e9clairs are the weapons of choice, along with, more recently, milkshakes. By and large, politicians have taken it in their stride. \u201cObviously not one of my fans,\u201d said Ed Miliband, then the leader of the opposition, after getting egged in 2012.", "That changed in 2016 after the murder of Jo Cox, a Labour MP , by a far-right fanatic, days before the Brexit referendum. Her killing caused politicians to rethink their approach to online threats. Opposition MP s have called on Boris Johnson, the prime minister, to stop using words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d in relation to Brexit, arguing that it puts them at risk. Mr Johnson has dismissed this as \u201chumbug\u201d."], "pubDate": null}
