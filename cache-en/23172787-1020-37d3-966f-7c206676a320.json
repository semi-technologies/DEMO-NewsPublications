The United States government negotiated bulk pricing for both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, $15.25 to $19.50 per dose over several different contracts. This is significantly less than the $25 to $37 Moderna says it will charge governments in the rest of the world, but analysts suggest that even $19.50 could yield Pfizer a 60 percent to 80 percent profit margin. Moderna has announced it won\u2019t enforce its patents, but the company hasn\u2019t forgotten about the profit opportunities.", "Whenever it looks as if we\u2019re getting a good deal, it turns out to be an even better one for the drug companies. Even ostensibly selfless actions might very well turn out to work to the industry\u2019s benefit.", "True, Oxford\u2019s deal with AstraZeneca included a commitment to at-cost pricing for developing countries for now. But The Financial Times has reported that an agreement the company has signed with at least one manufacturer indicated that this particular deal could end as soon as July. (The company has said that it will seek expert guidance as to when it can declare an end to the pandemic.) And AstraZeneca\u2019s deal with Oxford, according to The Financial Times, still allows for a healthy profit margin of up to 20 percent.", "This isn\u2019t surprising. The ship has long sailed on the idea that the giants of American capitalism would help anyone without extracting a fee. Even in this disaster, even after the untold sacrifices that millions of ordinary people have made. The real issue is not the price \u2014 we\u2019ll pay, obviously \u2014 it is about access.", "With control over the production of these vaccines, these companies will largely provide them on their own schedule, using their own factories or licensed producers \u2014 while other facilities around the world sit idle. Governments will almost certainly order more of the approved vaccines in the weeks and months to come, but the production capacity for each company is limited. Companies should not only pledge to waive their patents but to also share all their technical knowledge so that other manufacturers can help produce the much-needed vaccines.", "As it stands most people outside high-risk categories likely won\u2019t get vaccinated until \u201clater in 2021,\u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control. Many countries in the global south are expected to be able to vaccinate at most 20 percent of their populations by the end of next year. Project the current daily death toll onto that timeline and despair.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The especially galling thing is that mRNA vaccines were supposed to be a disruptive, liberatory technology. They can be produced faster and more simply, in smaller and cheaper facilities \u2014 basic laboratories, even \u2014 compared to traditional vaccines. Scientists envisioned a world where vaccines could be produced quickly, anywhere, for a small fraction of the traditional vaccines\u2019 cost."], "authors": ["Stephen Buranyi"], "keywords": ["big", "company", "savior", "vaccines", "wont", "times", "doesnt", "profit", "end", "deal", "pharma", "world", "york", "vaccine", "moderna", "traditional", "mean", "covid19", "companies"], "pubDate": "2020-12-17T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "f2968730-9ce5-3e6f-8e64-b6b9f68984b0"}
