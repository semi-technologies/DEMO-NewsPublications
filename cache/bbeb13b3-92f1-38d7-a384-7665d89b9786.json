In those early days, with stores closed and production stalled, designers seized the opportunity to finally, actually fix a few problems, starting with retail.", "Many advocated for a shift in the delivery calendar, moving fall collections to September and spring to March, for instance, when people are ready to shop those seasons. The idea was that it would create a ripple effect and address retail\u2019s other pain points, too, like excessive discounting (because clothes are delivered too early), unsold merchandise (because collections are too big), and general inefficiencies and waste (for both reasons). As Dries Van Noten wrote in his open letter, a more thoughtful retail calendar would allow for fewer collections, fewer products, and an \u201cincrease [in] sustainability throughout the supply chain.\u201d", "That\u2019s certainly an improvement on the pre-pandemic model of designing four to six collections per year, often with exclusive capsules in between. But bumping delivery windows and scaling back collections doesn\u2019t go far enough, at least in terms of fashion\u2019s carbon footprint. New Zealand designer Maggie Marilyn was an early advocate of change to the wholesale model and voiced her frustrations long before the pandemic. For one, many of her retail partners were unwilling or unable to share adequate information about her clothes, which are made using organic and recycled materials, and Marilyn found that buyers were constantly asking her to create additional styles, colors, or options. When asked if the wholesale model itself was inhibiting designers from being truly sustainable\u2014or at least making it incredibly difficult\u2014Marilyn\u2019s response was unflinching: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d", "\u201cI tried designing smaller collections, thinking I could reason with the buyers [about] why, but the lack of choice wasn\u2019t received so well,\u201d she tells Vogue. \u201cThe tight turnarounds between seasons left such limited time for research and development that finding and testing new innovative fabrications, or having time to ensure fabrics are coming from traceable supply chains, is incredibly difficult. And further to this, you need to air freight all of your fabrics due to the tight turnaround, which produces significantly higher carbon emissions than if we sea freighted them.\u201d"], "authors": ["Emily Farra", "Emily Farr"], "keywords": ["retail", "early", "designers", "stronger", "collections", "need", "thats", "bolderwhy", "tight", "pandemic", "wholesale", "young", "seasons", "faster", "directtoconsumer", "going", "share", "change", "model", "supply"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
