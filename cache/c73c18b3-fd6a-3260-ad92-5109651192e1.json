In pre-internet England, Twigs looked at old vinyl record sleeves for inspiration\u2014Adam Ant and Bow Wow Wow\u2019s Annabella Lwin were idols\u2014and improvised the looks with her mum\u2019s hand-me-downs and thrift-store trouvailles. (Her current collaborators\u2014including designer Ed Marler, the Central Saint Martins wild child; his partner, stylist Matthew Josephs; and performance artist Theo Adams\u2014all revere the movement too.)", "Twigs has been performing professionally since she was 13 and a dancer in the local ZooNation company, but when she moved to London at 17 she soon became involved in an underground performance-art cabaret scene. \u201cI had a boyfriend who said if I got a job at The Box, he\u2019d dump me,\u201d she says, \u201cso I went and got a job there and dumped him, just out of principle. I\u2019d sing old jazz songs and walk on tables and kick people\u2019s drinks off and be generally outrageous whilst singing this beautiful jazz song and remaining completely snatched in a beautiful dress. I\u2019d come up with the ideas, and my mum would make all the costumes.\u201d", "Ever the fashion chameleon, Twigs hit the Paris couture earlier this year variously dressed in giraffe-print boots and a logo bucket hat chez Valentino; a Margiela skirt fashioned from granddad pants, a striped shirt with peekaboo cutouts to reveal her lace girdle, an opal tooth cap, and white Tabi boots for Margiela Artisanal, where she was enraptured by her ardent admirer John Galliano\u2019s puff ball gown, which was originally fashioned as matelot pants. (\u201cMy mom dressed me as a sailor until I was three or four,\u201d she explains.)", "After her London move, a chance meeting with the photographer Matthew Stone soon led to a street-casting shoot for i-D. Her portrait made the magazine\u2019s cover, and in what she calls \u201cgenius serendipity,\u201d she put out her EP1 at the same time through YouTube. It went viral, and in short order Twigs put out two more EPs and a full-length album, LP1. Then she discovered that she had six fibroid tumors. \u201cI was in pain every single day for about a year,\u201d she says. After successful surgery last year, \u201cI spent some time discovering who I was, both musically and stylewise.
