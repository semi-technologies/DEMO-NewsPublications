All progress carries over to the full game should players purchase it, which is always a nice perk. The real main event of the demo, however, is the option to play as Wonder-Bayonetta, a pint-sized version of Platinum\u2019s sultry fan-favorite heroine. Wonder-Bayonetta served as a secret character in the original Wii U release that could only be unlocked by earning every in-game achievement. Packing her signature Scarborough Fair pistols and time-slowing Witch-Time dodge, she\u2019s a treat to play with and a fun Easter egg overall.", "The Bayonetta love doesn\u2019t stop there: As a treat for owners of the full game, the version 1.03 update adds a new Wonderful Code option for unlocking extra content. Platinum kicked things off by handing out the following codes to unlock Wonder-Bayonetta and her buddies Wonder-Jeanne and Wonder-Rodin.", "Wonder-Bayonetta: UMBRANGIFT", "Wonder-Jeanne/Wonder-Rodin: ANGELSLAYERS", "The Wonderful 101 spins a Saturday morning cartoon-style tale of a colorful superhero team fighting to stop a global alien invasion. Players command a tiny army of heroes and superpowered citizens to create Unite Morphs, over-the-top attacks such as giant fists and swords, by drawing symbols on screen. The Wonderful 101\u2019s Wii U release received generally positive reviews and amassed a cult following over the years. That passionate fan base went on to successfully crowdfund the Switch remaster\u2019s development, and the rest is history.", "The Wonderful 101: Remastered is out now for PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.
