He offered a solution. Russia and America would \u201cexchange guarantees of non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs, including electoral processes, including using ICT \u201d\u2014in short, a cyber-truce. Even as he spoke, his hackers were apparently deep inside some of America\u2019s most sensitive networks.", "American officials claim that a group of hackers known as APT 29, or more evocatively as Cozy Bear, thought to be part of the SVR , Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, penetrated several American government bodies\u2014the list so far includes the Treasury, Commerce, State and Homeland Security Departments, along with the National Institutes of Health\u2014where they could read emails at will. It appears to be one of the largest-ever acts of digital espionage against America.", "The intrusion took a circuitous route. Between March and June, SolarWinds, a Texan company, pushed out updates to its Orion software, which is widely used to help organisations monitor their networks. The malware hitched a ride on those updates. Once downloaded, it allowed hackers to impersonate an organisation\u2019s system administrators, who typically have the run of the entire network. It cleverly funnelled out data by disguising it as legitimate traffic while parrying anti-virus tools. Once inside, intruders can remain present even if Orion is disconnected.", "The campaign showed \u201ctop-tier operational tradecraft\u201d, says FireEye, a cyber-security firm that was itself a victim. Orion\u2019s ubiquity explains why so many organisations were affected. SolarWinds says that \u201cfewer than 18,000\u201d customers may have been struck, though most would have been collateral damage.", "America\u2019s ability to muster a response is unlikely to be helped by President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal, on November 17th, of Chris Krebs, the head of the Cyber-security and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ), for publicly affirming the integrity of the presidential election. CISA has struggled to cope with the onslaught.", "Over the past decade, America has tended to categorise and respond to cyber-attacks according to their aims. It regarded intrusions intended to steal secrets\u2014in other words, old-fashioned espionage\u2014as fair game, not least because its own National Security Agency ( NSA ) is a prolific thief. After China stole 22m security-clearance records from America\u2019s Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) in 2015, Michael Hayden, a former NSA chief, conceded that it was \u201chonourable espionage work\u201d. In contrast, attacks intended to cause harm, like North Korea\u2019s assault on Sony Pictures in 2014, or those with commercial aims, like China\u2019s theft of industrial secrets, were thought to cross a line. America has accordingly indicted and imposed sanctions on scores of Russian, Chinese, North Korean and Iranian hackers.", "Yet this effort to stamp norms onto a covert and chaotic arena of competition has been unsuccessful. For one thing, it is not always simple to define what is \u201chonourable\u201d, in Mr Hayden\u2019s parlance, and what is not. If stealing a policy document is kosher, why not a vaccine? The line between espionage and subversion is also blurred: is Russia stealing emails to understand American policy, or to publish them later? It is not always clear until after the fact.", "Most so-called cyber-attacks are simply espionage. But espionage conducted over computer networks has enabled intelligence gathering on a scale that was previously impossible. Though America has been as much a beneficiary of this intelligence revolution as it has been a victim, it has grown less tolerant in recent years. American views of \u201cwhat\u2019s allowed in cyberspace\u201d have changed since the OPM breach five years ago, says Max Smeets of the Centre for Security Studies in Zurich. Such large-scale espionage \u201cwould be now at the top of the list of operations that they would deem as unacceptable,\u201d he suggests."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["intelligence", "security", "organisations", "hackers", "espionage", "american", "updates", "bear", "thought", "americas", "heart", "hunt", "vaulted", "america", "victim"], "pubDate": "2020-12-14T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
