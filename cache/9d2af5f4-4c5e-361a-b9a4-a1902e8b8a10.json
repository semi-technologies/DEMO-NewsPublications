But this year\u2019s gathering coincided with some explosive illustrations of the limits, and abuses, of that power. This past Tuesday, Britain\u2019s Supreme Court issued a rebuke of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for an \u201cunlawful\u201d suspension of Parliament. Hours later, the U.S. House of Representatives launched its impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. \u201cThe other one is the Israeli election,\u201d Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man, pointed out, as he chewed a piece of salmon at a wobbly cocktail table. (There was no clear winner in Israel\u2019s most recent vote.) Dangote, a sixty-two-year-old Nigerian industrialist, was at the Plaza Hotel, in midtown, for the Bloomberg Global Business Forum, an alternative gathering that aspires to be a refuge from the political hurricanes outside. It\u2019s a successor, of sorts, to the Clinton Global Initiative, which used to hold an annual meeting alongside the U.N. General Assembly (known to wonks by one word: Unga). After the initiative shut down, in 2017, Michael Bloomberg started hosting a few hundred executives for a day. This year\u2019s event was titled \u201cRestoring Global Stability.\u201d Seated across the table from Dangote was Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary, who reached for a small cookie from a silver dessert tower. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about ideas, not politics,\u201d he said.", "The select politicians in attendance knew the room. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, of India, said in his speech, \u201cToday, there is a government in India that respects the business world and wealth creators.\u201d Between talks, the executives huddled in the Palm Court, the Plaza\u2019s restaurant, where concentric rings of security kept the world at bay. Even in the warm embrace of exclusivity, Paulson and Dangote attracted a stream of visitors: Christine Lagarde, the incoming president of the European Central Bank; Stephen Schwarzman and Larry Fink, the heads of Blackstone and BlackRock, respectively; and John Elkann, the Italian scion of the Agnelli car dynasty.", "Between handshakes, a billionaire investor said, \u201cThe world is becoming a world of conferences. I go to about fifty each year, and I kind of wonder, How many of these can we go to? You always see the same people, and you always say, \u2018Let\u2019s have lunch, let\u2019s have dinner.\u2019 And, of course, you never have lunch, never have dinner.\u201d Today\u2019s masters of the universe jet around the globe on the conference circuit, like Presidential candidates touching down at state fairs. Functions like the Bloomberg forum offer a break from burdens like public scrutiny of their taxes and their defense of alleged monopolies. \u201cI think, throughout the history of the world, there\u2019s always a pressure, always people that don\u2019t like wealthy people,\u201d the investor went on. For one day, the Palm Court was an oasis, where executives could imagine a world without angry speeches denouncing millionaires and billionaires.", "A guest with a buzz cut approached Paulson: \u201cI heard you were an ex-wrestler in high school. That\u2019s what Don Rumsfeld tells me.\u201d", "\u201cThose days are long gone,\u201d Paulson replied, politely, \u201cthough, when I\u2019m making a big speech or something, I still shake my hands out.\u201d", "Paulson returned to his conversation with Dangote and Justin Smith, the C.E.O. of Bloomberg Media; they were already planning the next conference, a larger Bloomberg confab to be held in Beijing, in November. Smith recalled proposing the idea to Paulson in 2015: \u201cI came in the middle of the winter, to your office in Chicago, and I said, \u2018I think the world really needs something like this.\u2019 \u201d Paulson was dubious at first. \u201cPeople get asked to go to conferences all the time,\u201d he told Smith. But he changed his mind, because the proposal emphasized substance, because Chinese leaders were receptive, and because C.E.O.s were ready to fly there. \u201cIf the Chinese believe all we\u2019re trying to do is contain them, there is no incentive to find common ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be engaging them on some of today\u2019s most important economic issues.\u201d The event in Beijing, he said, is \u201cnot just a conference where people get together and spout, like they do at Davos and other places.\u201d", "The Beijing conference is called the New Economy Forum, a title choice that generated anxiety at the World Economic Forum. \u201cW.E.F. is getting very, very worried about this sort of gathering,\u201d Dangote said. \u201cThey kept asking, \u2018Are you coming to Davos?\u2019 \u2018What are all these things about?\u2019\u2014you know? I said, \u2018Look, joining the New Economy Forum does not mean that I\u2019m not going to Davos.\u2019 \u201d \u2666"], "pubDate": null, "id": "9d2af5f4-4c5e-361a-b9a4-a1902e8b8a10", "keywords": ["conference", "paulson", "global", "bloomberg", "assembly", "gathering", "world", "answer", "smith", "dangote", "michael", "bloombergs", "forum", "executives", "general"], "title": "Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Answer to the U.N.
