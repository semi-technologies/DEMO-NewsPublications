Stranded at her mother\u2019s house on a kibbutz, she wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the area. \u201cLuckily I had taken my sewing machine,\u201d she says. \u201cI had all of my old sweaters and the first samples. I was back to being 15 again, sewing all day with nothing to do.\u201d Following her signature patchwork theme, Sherris began to sew the fabric together in her childhood room, using patches and not patterns, with \u201cno consistency,\u201d resulting in one-of-a-kind pieces.", "Her stockpile of sweaters has since been used up, but she has still continued upcycling. Currently she scouts thrift shops for cashmere and wool, prewashing them in water, and then assembles the pieces. \u201cThere is so much cashmere and wool that was dyed and manipulated,\u201d she says. \u201cUsing what was already created makes sense to me, since our earth is suffering and fashion is a big part of that. It\u2019s an effort to create a model of sustainability, not only to raise awareness but also utilizing it.\u201d In the future, Sherris plans to take old sweaters from her clients and \u201cSherris them,\u201d which is what her customers call turning them into a one-of-a-kind patchwork. The happy, instantly feel-good Sherris look is brighter than ever in its knit form. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t think about it a million times. You should just put it on,\u201d says the designer.
