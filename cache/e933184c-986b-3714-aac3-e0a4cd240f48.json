Before he fell sick he had treated many patients at York hospital but he and his family fear for their future in the UK because the Home Office has not yet confirmed what will happen to them after Enany\u2019s visa expires next month.", "A recent Commons Library briefing states: \u201cOver 67,000 NHS staff in England are EU nationals \u2013 5.5% of all staff.

However, this concession only applied to about 3,000 workers, and left out thousands of care workers and NHS staff including low paid healthcare assistants, hospital cleaners and porters.", "Arun Panabaka, 37, is a senior nursing assistant from India. He is highly qualified with diplomas in health and social care and public health and more than a decade of experience in healthcare. He came to the UK in 2019 on a spouse visa but his work permit ran out on 12 October this year. He was unable to renew it because his role was not on the Home Office\u2019s shortage occupation list and returned to India with his wife.", "\u201cI felt a lot of pride in helping to care for Covid patients at St Bartholomew\u2019s hospital in London earlier this year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was difficult work both physically and emotionally and I had to live in NHS accommodation away from my wife and nine-year-old daughter for four months to protect them. I believe the NHS needs more nursing staff, not fewer, to look after people with Covid, and that with more of these staff more lives could be saved.\u201d", "The Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea said: \u201cTreating overseas health and care workers this way is shameful. These staff are on the frontline, caring for the most vulnerable in society. Shutting them out of the visa extension scheme is a shortsighted and dangerous move. With 122,000 vacancies across the sector, ministers shouldn\u2019t be driving key workers out and barring new ones from coming here.\u201d", "Minnie Rahman, the public affairs and campaigns manager at Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \u201cPeople who\u2019ve been risking their lives to keep us safe shouldn\u2019t have to jump through endless hoops and pay astronomical fees just to keep living and working here. Limited visa extensions made earlier this year caused devastating confusion and did not protect key workers from the stress of the immigration system. The government must now take fair and practical action, and grant free visa extensions and the right to stay to all key workers.\u201d", "A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cOverseas health and care workers provide extraordinary contributions right across our NHS caring for those in need and they have saved countless lives throughout the coronavirus pandemic. We want to ensure the best health professionals from around the world continue to come to work in our outstanding NHS and wider health and care sector, which is why they can apply for the health and care visa at a lower cost to other routes.\u201d"], "authors": ["Diane Taylor"], "keywords": ["wave", "care", "rules", "leave", "key", "second", "nhs", "healthcare", "workers", "forcing", "visa", "uk", "health", "migrant", "work", "staff"], "pubDate": "2020-11-09T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
