The American Fashion designer called upon the starry circle of friends in his Rolodex to show him and GLWD support\u2014and it likely wasn\u2019t a tough sell.", "The first-ever virtual Golden Hearts Awards began like this: Anna Wintour (Honorary Chairwoman of the night) rang Kors on FaceTime to discuss the event. \u201cDid you come up with a fabulous way to start the show?\u201d she prompted, seated at her World Trade Center desk behind her signature sunglasses. \u201cYou know how much I adore the theater,\u201d Kors replied. \u201cSo, I thought we would open with some sort of fabulous opening act.\u201d He proceeded to tell Wintour about all the potential talents he\u2019s considering: Sarah Paulson, Alan Cumming, Seth Meyers, Beanie Feldstein, Bella Hadid, Kaia Gerber.", "But how will he narrow it down? With auditions! \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a bunch of celebrities and great actors audition to be on your Zoom show?\u201d Wintour asked, incredulous. \u201cAnd they say I\u2019m difficult. Good luck!\u201d", "What followed was a rapid-fire style of auditions where each subsequent actor seems less suited for the job than the next. \u201cMy movie stalled because of COVID, but I am really inside my character and need to express her,\u201d said Paulson in an unconvincing accent that aimed for French\u2014next. Feldstein, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t quite figure out how to unmute her audio on the call\u2014next. Iman appeared with fantastical filters on her face, claiming they were authentic\u2014next. And Kaia Gerber and Bella Hadid, on a group call, only wanted to speak on \u201cprecision thermoelectric measurements in high temperature resistivity systems\u201d\u2014next! Kors settled on comedian Amber Ruffin, who delivered a job well done. Now onto the charity.", "Last night\u2019s event took place on World AIDS Day, which was poignantly timed given God\u2019s Love We Deliver\u2019s origins. As Karen Pearl, president and CEO of the charity, explained, GLWD was born in 1985 as a way to end hunger and malnutrition among individuals in the New York area living with HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other serious illnesses.", "\u201cThis evening, on World AIDS Day, I am reminded that we are made for this moment,\u201d said Pearl. \u201c35 years ago, God\u2019s Love got started at the height of the AIDS pandemic, and here we are again in another pandemic\u2014reaching the most vulnerable and most isolated is in our DNA. Once COVID hit the city, we were forced to change every part of our operations overnight. But what hasn\u2019t changed is the love we put into every meal that we cook, package, and deliver. Since March, we have brought 4,000 new clients to our program. And this year we will cook and deliver 2.5 million meals.\u201d", "Now, GLWD deliveries are conducted by mask-wearing volunteers who socially distance upon arrival. During the program, we heard from some of the employees and volunteers who have dedicated their time to the charity. \u201cMy grandmother died of Alzheimer\u2019s. And I know if she had this company, she would live a little longer. That\u2018s why I\u2019m here,\u201d shared one man. \u201cI had a best friend who actually passed away from HIV in 2018. I\u2019m still giving her the chance to live life outside of me, providing meals for the clients,\u201d explained another.", "Throughout the hour, Kors and Ruffin encouraged viewers\u2014some of whom had received a package of cheese-board essentials from chef Mike Anthony of Gramercy Tavern to enjoy while watching\u2014to donate to the cause. Donations were being matched by Craig Newmark Philanthropies and Bank of America, but there was also an auction, up through December 11, with lots including a dinner cohosted by none other than Kors and Wintour, and another at Carbone with Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka.", "The evening culminated with a performance from the original cast of RENT, including Idina Menzel, Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, and Taye Diggs. Despite the Airpods in their ears and varying Zoom backgrounds, they sang in harmony, opting to perform \u201cSeasons of Love.\u201d A perfect note to end on."], "authors": ["Lilah Ramzi", "Lilah Ramz"], "keywords": ["charity", "best", "program", "brought", "kors", "im", "glwd", "wintour", "broadway", "world", "gods", "love", "deliver", "fashion", "virtual", "benefit", "aids"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
