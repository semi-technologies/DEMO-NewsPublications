Over the years, the German-American model has busted out some seriously iconic costumes including a zombie-alien, Jessica Rabbit, and Fiona from Shrek, among many other memorable looks. Her commitment is unmatched. She\u2019s known to spend hours in the makeup chair, piling on the prosthetics to look nothing like herself. (Remember when she went as an elderly Heidi Klum?) Her annual Halloween bash, meanwhile, is also always typically star-studded, the event of the season where guests always pull out their best costumes. \u201cWhat I love the most is for people to be able to escape and to transform into someone else,\u201d Klum says of Halloween. \u201cWith makeup and a costume, you can be anyone and anything. That allows most people to be loose and have more fun.\u201d", "Knowing that her annual Halloween party would be a no-go due to COVID-19 this year didn\u2019t stop Klum from marking the holiday in her own special way. What, you didn\u2019t think she would miss the opportunity to dress up, did you? \u201cAs we are all adjusting to this new world, I knew that I wanted to do something special for all the Halloween fanatics out there that are as crazy about the holiday as I am,\u201d she tells Vogue. \u201cWith lockdowns in many countries around the world, and no party to go to, I came up with the idea of doing a horror short film\u2014and who better to do this with than my own family?\u201d", "Photo: Courtesy of Heidi Klum", "Posted to her Instagram this morning, Klum\u2019s take on a horror film sees the model at home with her four children\u2014Leny, Henry, Johan, and Lou\u2014and husband Tom Kaulitz, all of whom suddenly get possessed by evil spirits and become zombie-mummies; Klum then must hide and disguise herself in the house to avoid being eaten alive by her ghoulish family. Shooting the campy video was a wild (and totally amusing) affair for the whole crew. \u201cWe had so much fun shooting this together,\u201d Klum says. \u201cMy kids learned so much in these two days of filming about how some tricks work, how to move and act like mummies, how to remember their lines and cues. Even though they have come to visit me on many sets over the years, this is the first time they have participated.\u201d", "In the clip, she sports two \u201cdisguise\u201d looks to hide from the zombie-mummies: the first is a blend-into-the-wall look, and the second saw Klum transform herself into a bedsheet. \u201cI am a huge fan of transformation and that can happen in many different ways,\u201d Klum says, adding that, for this Halloween, she wanted to forgo the over-the-top creations she's known for in favor of something more cinematic. \u201cThis year for this short film, I did not want to work with prosthetics,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to get back to the basics and get body painted. I worked with the amazing David Gilmore and his team. Each body painting took about 7 hours.\u201d", "Photo: Courtesy of Heidi Klum", "While her costumes may be tame compared to Klum\u2019s past creations, the model says she wasn\u2019t afraid to push the comedic envelope this year, though. \u201cSitting on the toilet was pretty funny, while I was cramped in a room with the entire film team pretending to push one out,\u201d Klum says of the video. \u201cI asked for a really loud bloppp sound, because I really wanted people to laugh while watching this.\u201d You\u2019ll laugh, you\u2019ll scream\u2014and you can say Klum came to save Halloween.", "Watch the full Halloween video above, and below, Klum documented the shoot day exclusively for Vogue."], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "keywords": ["costumes", "zombiemummies", "klums", "behindthescenes", "youll", "wanted", "heidi", "video", "fabulously", "creepy", "film", "klum", "halloween", "model", "look"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
