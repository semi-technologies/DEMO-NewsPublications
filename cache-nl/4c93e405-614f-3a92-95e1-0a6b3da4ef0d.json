In 2006, it burned down after something went wrong in a clandestine laboratory inside, used to wash, cut, and press cocaine. One person died, and two were seriously injured.", "On 8 August last year, a police search at the same address found 12.7 kilos of cocaine, a large quantity of chemicals, a cocaine press, scales, moulds, packaging materials, and stamps used by drugs gangs to print their logos on bricks of coke. None of the four men arrested in and near the house was registered as living there.", "Detectives were in no doubt that they had dismantled another lab operated by a criminal organization. Mayor Femke Halsema ordered that the house be sealed shut for three months to prevent it from being reused for the same purpose. This was welcome news to the Egyptian couple who owned the property: they had rented it to a man who then sublet it.", "\u2018Hospital smell\u2019", "Amsterdam CID officers often find coke labs, in many cases during raids on expensive apartments with no registered inhabitants. They frequently encounter men, often Albanian, who give vague reasons for being on the premises.", "Inhabitants of the Eerste Oosterparkstraat in the Oost neighbourhood of Amsterdam recently noticed what they described as \u201ca hospital smell\u201d. When the fire brigade entered the home concerned, a number of men fled through the garden and tried to get back into the street through another house. They, too, had been operating a coke lab.", "Andr\u00e9 \u2013 he is not allowed to disclose his surname \u2013 is a specialist member of the police team that dismantles drug labs. He says the number of finds has been increasing for years. \u201cThere were eighty-five in the whole of the Netherlands in 2017, and 121 in 2018. This year we\u2019re finding two to three a week, which will probably be a record.\u201d Andr\u00e9 also says the labs are becoming increasingly large and professional.", "\u201cIndustrial scale\u201d", "The increasingly advanced labs making the synthetic drugs of which the Netherlands is a prime supplier \u2013 amphetamines, MDMA, crystal meth, and their ingredients \u2013 have traditionally been in the south of the country. Today, they are increasingly being found in rural areas in the north and east. In the past, they stored chemicals in tanks with capacities of a few hundred litres: these days, police are finding industrial-scale 2,850-litre containers several metres high. Sometimes, synthetic drugs are made in combination with cocaine or heroin.", "More cocaine and heroin processing labs are springing up in cities and other densely populated areas. These require less space: a flat, garage, or shed is all it takes. \u201cYou can set up a coke-washing facility on the twelfth floor of a building, no problem,\u201d says Andr\u00e9.", "Cocaine is increasingly arriving in large batches in containers from central and South America, in one-kilo blocks mixed in with bananas and pineapples. Smaller quantities are hidden in beeswax, plastic, charcoal and other materials to reduce the chance of detection; coke has even been dissolved in small bags of colourless liquid, which are then placed in larger bags of water used to import tropical fish. Quite a challenge for customs officers to detect the illicit trafficking.", "When the coke arrives in the Netherlands, drugs labs often use highly flammable solvents to separate it from other substances. \u201cSpecialists come over from Colombia to do it, or they teach it to gangs here,\u201d Andr\u00e9 says. \u201cWashing gives you freebase coke or crack, which you can smoke. In the Netherlands, gangs process it mainly using hydrochloric acid and acetone to make cocaine hydrochloride, the pearly powder that you sniff.\u201d", "Children\u2019s bedrooms", "In a basement near Amsterdam CID headquarters, Andr\u00e9 shows us around three reconstructed crime scenes. One is a dumping ground for drugs waste, full of leaking jerrycans, hoses, and other bits and pieces, typical of the two to three hundred found each year. The second makes synthetic drugs, and the third coke. On the wall are photographs of laboratories, which have been discovered in bathrooms (where the tiles are easy to wash), and even in children\u2019s bedrooms, one containing a colourful baby carrier.", "The drugs are refined in a chemical bath, and then dried, cut with medicinal or narcotic drugs, pressed into one-kilo bricks, marked with a logo, and dried again.", "\u201cThe drying is done using heatlamps, or sometimes a microwave,\u201d says Andr\u00e9. \u201cUnfortunately, microwaves aren\u2019t suitable for drying acetone, and they can cause a really bad explosion.\u201d The chemical gives off dangerous fumes even at minus 20 degrees, and a single spark can cause an explosion unless the room is very well ventilated.", "Finally, the bricks are wrapped in rubber again \u2013 often using black balloons \u2013 and wrapped in tape, like the bricks that come straight from South America. This is done to imply that the cocaine is pure and uncut \u2013 as Andr\u00e9 says, \u201cYou could see it as a form of brand counterfeiting.\u201d", "Bazooka", "Buyers of cocaine from Colombia and the surrounding countries cut the cocaine, then press it into bricks and pack it. A third, relatively new method is to refine raw cocaine paste, sometimes known as bazooka, and make bricks.", "Because the labs use flammable chemicals and often amateurish production methods, there is a huge risk of toxic vapour, fire, and explosions. Sometimes people die \u2013 it happened in the Noord district of Amsterdam in 2006, and in a flat in Arnhem in summer 2018, killing two men and leaving one seriously injured. More often, the labs just about manage to stay safe, but the Nederlands Forensisch Instituut has recorded twenty-eight explosions in residential areas.", "The team of detectives responsible for shutting down dangerous coke labs is focusing on the acetone commonly used to process cocaine. It takes 1,000 litres of this chemical to wash 100 kilos of cocaine, along with much smaller quantities of sulphuric and hydrochloric acid and ammonia. The acetone can be used only three or four times, and then the cocaine starts to lose its pure white colour.", "Acetone week", "Another member of the team is Anouk \u2013 again, she\u2019s not allowed to reveal her full name. \u201cThe drugs problem in Amsterdam is so big that we\u2019re looking for smart, workable ways of combating it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re concentrating on the illegal use of acetone, which is also used legitimately by nail salons, painters, and businesses that process polyester, such as surfboard and car body repairers.\u201d", "Bulk acetone is available from DIY and hardware stores, wholesalers, paint suppliers, and online, Anouk says. \u201cLegal suppliers are knowingly or unknowingly allowing it to be used for the illegal purposes that we\u2019re trying to combat.\u201d", "The detectives visit stores and tell them about acetone\u2019s important role in cocaine production. They urge them not to sell acetone to customers they don\u2019t know, and to report suspect transactions to customs. Last week was designated as \u201cacetone week\u201d, in which police and retailers placed a special focus on the chemical. Customs officers can also visit companies selling acetone and inspect their books, though resources are limited.", "Illegitimate buyers often claim they\u2019re using the acetone to restore mobile phones, kitchens, wood, or glass. \u201cIt\u2019s all nonsense,\u201d says Anouk. \u201cSellers need to realise what criminals can do with acetone. If you buy it from a wholesaler, you\u2019re supposed to give them your company registration number, but stores shouldn\u2019t sell it even in small quantities without asking what it\u2019s for.\u201d", "It\u2019s also illegal to possess more than 25 litres of acetone, an offence punishable by up to two years\u2019 imprisonment, or four years for repeat offenders."], "authors": ["Paul Vugts", "Translation", "Het Vertaalcollectief"], "keywords": ["acetone", "coke", "amsterdam", "labs", "drugs", "andr\u00e9", "danger", "cocaine", "increases", "does", "bricks", "using", "number", "used"], "pubDate": "2019-11-18T12:10:09Z", "publicationId": "a3002aeb-6d5a-3894-adcb-0212effbc567"}
