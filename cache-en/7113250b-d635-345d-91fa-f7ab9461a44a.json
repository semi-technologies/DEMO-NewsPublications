This week he had to bat away accusations of nepotism over PPE contracts awarded to a local fashion company.", "When the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) started the race for a new leader in February, Laschet, the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia and a centrist, was widely hailed as the continuity candidate, and thus frontrunner, to take Germany\u2019s biggest party into the post-Merkel era, including next autumn\u2019s federal elections. But 10 months on, the leader of Germany\u2019s most populous state is starting to look like a risky bet.", "Laschet\u2019s talent for crisis management first came under scrutiny in the spring when he was one of the pushiest advocates for easing the nationwide lockdown, only to then have to impose the first local lockdown in his own back yard as infections spiralled out of control in the town of G\u00fctersloh.", "Confronted with criticism on political talkshows, the former MEP could come across as petulant and short-tempered, and Merkel\u2019s hysteria-dampening way with words continues to evade the Rhinelander to this day.", "At the end of November, Laschet was widely ridiculed for a lack of perspective when he warned that the coming Christmas would be \u201cthe toughest ever experienced by the postwar generation\u201d.", "This week the married father of three again found himself on the defence when it emerged that the North-Rhine Westphalian state had handed PPE contracts worth a total of \u20ac42.5m to the M\u00f6nchengladbach-based fashion company Van Laack, which also pays Laschet\u2019s son, Johannes Laschet, 32, to show its clothes on his Instagram channel.", "Laschet said the accusations of nepotism were \u201cobscene\u201d and politically motivated. The interior ministry of North-Rhine Westphalia confirmed that Van Laack\u2019s offer had been the cheapest of seven. Johannes, who has 92,000 followers on Instagram, insisted he had received \u201cnot a cent\u201d to facilitate the deal.", "But the episode once again emphasised the contrast between Laschet and the leader of Germany\u2019s second most populous state. In Bavaria the coronavirus fatalities and infection rates have been higher than anywhere apart from in the capital, Berlin, yet Markus S\u00f6der, of the CSU (Christian Social Union), sister party to the CDU, has managed to project leadership qualities that have helped his approval ratings soar.", "Laschet\u2019s public relations struggles are also starting to show up in the polls. A survey by the pollster Civey published by Der Spiegel this week showed Laschet dropping to the bottom of the three-horse race for the CDU leadership.", "The poll showed Laschet to be the least popular candidate with the general public and among CDU supporters, behind the conservative hardliner Friedrich Merz in front and the centrist foreign policy expert Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the supposed outsider candidate, in second place.", "Laschet retains an advantage in that almost 30% of the 1,001 delegates who will cast their vote on the future leadership in a digital party congress in January hail from his home state and could be inclined to prove their loyalty.", "In a recent interview, Laschet ruled out swapping with the deputy in his two-man team to let Jens Spahn, the popular health minister, vie for the top job instead.", "But time is running out for Laschet to boost his image. After the current CDU leader and original Merkel continuity candidate, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, announced her resignation in February, a vote on the succession was scheduled for the spring.", "The pandemic forced the party to postpone not just its congress in April but also the replacement summit on 4 December, leading Laschet\u2019s rival, Merz, to accuse the party headquarters of trying to buy its favourite candidate more time. Laschet, Merz said waspishly, needed \u201cmore time to improve his performance\u201d."], "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "keywords": ["latest", "merkels", "cdu", "merz", "hitch", "nepotism", "successor", "designated", "northrhine", "state", "germanys", "laschet", "claims", "week", "leader", "party", "candidate"], "pubDate": "2020-12-04T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
