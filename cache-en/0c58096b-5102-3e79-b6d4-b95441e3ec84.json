That\u2019s [only] animated? Do you want me to take the board with the added time from the fourth official\u2019s hands and see what happens to me? For some reason I am different.\u201d", "Unsurprisingly Klopp had a different view. \u201cThe win was absolutely deserved,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a top side \u2013 a counterattacking monster \u2013 so you have to be really focused, and because they don\u2019t want the ball too much you have to play around them and keep them busy. We did that really, really well. What a wonderful goal to win it, a nice corner [from Andy Robertson] and a sensational header from Bobby.\u201d", "The Liverpool manager added: \u201c[Mourinho] didn\u2019t say anything to me about my behaviour on the touchline. I thought he said the best team lost. It was not heated at all. I thought he was joking, but he wasn\u2019t.

Then we have the corner and header from Harry, plus other counterattack positions.\u201d", "He was, though, content with the overall display. \u201cThe team was brilliant,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cToday Liverpool didn\u2019t look a team that is champion, European champion, world champion \u2013 that difference was not on the pitch. Even a draw would not have been the best taste \u2013 we had it there to kill it but we missed the chance. We were so close to winning: a draw would be a bad result \u2013 so you can imagine how we feel with a defeat.", "Liverpool's Curtis Jones enjoys the midfield battle and comes of age Read more", "\u201cIt was a very good performance, of course there were some mistakes, some things to improve. My team told me I am right when I say from the beginning of the season we go to every match to win. We played against the champions in their stadium and we had the best chances to win.\u201d", "Having previously described his side as \u201cjust a pony\u201d in the title race, Mourinho also insisted he is now at ease describing Tottenham as firmly in the title hunt. \u201cThe first thing that makes title contenders is to go to every match to win it with that ambition and I promise you the ambition is there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf in any match you see us not trying to win it is not that we don\u2019t want it is because the opponent pushes us to different situations.\u201d", "Liverpool\u2019s ascendancy was underlined by their 200 passes in the final third to Spurs\u2019 count of just 19 with Klopp taking aim at Mourinho and his side over their lack of adventure. \u201cIf you ask me now, I can\u2019t remember the 19.
