Only a few weeks later, the model opted for a classic trench by the label. Now it seems that Shayk is on the Moschino x Palace front, and could be championing that for some time. Now, let\u2019s wait and see what in-demand piece she wears next."], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["moschino", "weeks", "x", "shayk", "look", "life", "puffer", "irina", "burberry", "week", "logomania", "breathes", "palace", "label"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
