In our current fashion landscape, though, the style has taken on new relevance as we discover new ways to embrace loungewear. For a while I tried to keep wearing \u201creal clothes\u201d throughout the pandemic. But nine months later (or is it 10?), I have fallen into a sweater-every-day rut. And while I\u2019m at it, I may as well lean into knitwear fully. The sweater bra turned out to be a game-changing \u201cloungewear turned everyday-wear\u201d item I can\u2019t wait to put on every morning.", "I\u2019ve always been a fan of bralettes and barely-there bras. And frankly, now that I don\u2019t really leave my house and my coworkers only see me from the shoulders up, the case for wearing a bra at all is, well, up to your own discretion. But for the past two weeks or so, I\u2019ve been going back and forth between a Donni bra I was so kindly gifted and a Jacquemus bra (below) that I picked up during an impulse Singles\u2019 Day purchase after thoroughly enjoying my days in the Donni one.", "So far it\u2019s been pretty lovely, and way more practical than I thought a \u201cnovelty\u201d fashion item could ever prove to be. The straps aren\u2019t constantly falling down, underwire is never poking into me, and it doesn\u2019t really feel like you are wearing anything, which is usually the goal for bras that claim to be comfortable. Besides the fact I don\u2019t need much support while hanging around my apartment, that\u2019s not really what I am looking to get out of knitted bras. Why shouldn\u2019t our undergarments be as wonderfully soft and cozy as what we\u2019re piling on top of them? Plus, I feel way more put-together, cute, and just as comfortable in a knit bra, sweater, and a pair of jeans as I do in a sports bra and leggings.", "While I\u2019ve especially enjoyed wearing them around my apartment, I also look forward to the future, when I can style them for out-of-the-house looks. Turns out I\u2019m not the only one who has gone to the knit, either. One of my colleagues, Elise Taylor, also has and loves her Jacquemus knit bra. Like me, she has been mostly wearing it to lounge around the house, but is also considering purchasing the matching cardigan to take the look to the next level.", "So whether you\u2019re in a sweater slump, are looking for the next best cozy item to add to your quarantine wardrobe, or just want to jump on the Khaite-, Jacquemus-, and Off White\u2013backed trend, here\u2019s a few knit and cashmere bras at every price that won\u2019t disappoint.", "Jacquemus Valensole mohair bralette $150 MODA OPERANDI Shop Now Donni sweater bralette $74 REVOLE Shop Now", "Khaite Eda cashmere soft-cup bra $520 NET-A-PORTER Shop Now Simonett ribbed knit sweater bra $55 SIMONETT Shop Now"], "authors": ["Madeline Fass", "Madeline Fas"], "keywords": ["fallen", "ive", "novelty", "jacquemus", "item", "bra", "wearing", "shop", "bras", "really", "donni", "sweater", "knit"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
