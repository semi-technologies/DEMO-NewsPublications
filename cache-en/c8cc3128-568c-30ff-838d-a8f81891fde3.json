It\u2019s also the last thing I want to do. Not because I don\u2019t want to honor the Umbrella Academy star, who came out earlier this week as trans, but because it means talking about the fact that people\u2014celebrities or otherwise\u2014still have to come out at all. That every time someone does there\u2019s a collective breath-holding, waiting anxiously to see the reaction, to see if anything has changed.", "Page, it seems, was prepared for this. In his coming-out post on social media, the Oscar-nominated actor expressed gratitude for both having \u201carrived at this place in my life\u201d and the support he\u2019s received, as well as the work the trans community has done to fight for equality. But, he added, \u201cI\u2019m also scared. I\u2019m scared of the invasiveness, the hate, the \u2018jokes,\u2019 and of violence.\u201d In sharing his true self, Page is also opening himself up to a world of scrutiny at a fraught time for everyone, and specifically for trans people. He noted in his post the amount of violence trans people, particularly those who are Black and Latinx, face, and addressed transphobes directly, adding, \u201cYou aren\u2019t being \u2018canceled,\u2019 you are hurting people. I am one of those people and we won\u2019t be silent in the face of your attacks.\u201d", "Perhaps that is why it\u2019s hard to write about. Any amount of ink spilled\u2014no matter how celebratory\u2014can lead to backlash. Silence rarely helps anything, but it\u2019s hard not to be concerned. The internet is not known for its across-the-board kindness, after all, and a celebrity\u2019s coming out can often be proof of that.", "After Page posted his message on Tuesday, the reaction was swift and mostly positive. At least at the start. On Instagram, everyone from Broad City stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson to Page\u2019s Juno director Jason Reitman chimed in with support. So did the account for The Umbrella Academy, which wrote \u201cso proud of our superhero!! WE LOVE YOU ELLIOT!!!\u201d On Twitter, Page\u2019s X-Men costar Patrick Stewart wrote, \u201cI am proud to be your friend\u201d and fellow superhero Mark Ruffalo offered congratulations too. Transgender activist Raquel Willis also expressed support, as did writer-actor Jen Richards. There was also, amongst the more than 45,000 responses, a garden variety of transphobic comments and arguments about identity and pronouns. But even those were largely rebuffed by other commenters coming to Page\u2019s defense. They did the same when conservative commentator Steven Crowder attempted to make jokes at the actor\u2019s expense.", "Netflix revealed Tuesday that Page would continue playing Vanya Hargreeves on The Umbrella Academy, which is about to begin filming its third season. Vanya is a cisgender woman, but, sources told Variety there aren\u2019t currently plans to change the character\u2019s gender. The streaming service also said it is in the process of changing Page\u2019s name in the metadata for all of his movies and shows.", "What happens beyond that for Page is unclear. Then again, this is 2020, and what happens for anyone is unclear. With time, though, the actor\u2019s brave move could provide inspiration for thousands, if not millions, and gives Hollywood another immensely talented trans actor to hire. (Seriously, Elliot Page is an international treasure. Give him a thousand amazing roles to play.) Perhaps it even means that one day people, let alone actors, won\u2019t even have to come out at all. Nothing will be presumed and everyone will be able to tell you who they are as they see fit."], "authors": ["Angela Watercutter", "Angela Watercutte"], "keywords": ["ascent", "pages", "page", "actors", "trans", "academy", "write", "wrote", "support", "umbrella", "elliot"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "212e56a6-e535-3569-ad1b-2215526c1d9d"}
