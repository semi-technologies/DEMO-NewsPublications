At the moment, her love belongs to Bj\u00f6rk. Just yesterday, the model posted a selfie of herself wearing a polo t-shirt boasting a screen-printed image of the Icelandic singer. It\u2019s quite the style switch-up compared to Hadid\u2019s other look this past week when she stepped out in an equally entertaining but cheeky Playboy Bunny print shirt underneath a Harley Davidson leather jacket.", "Photo: Courtesy of Getty Images", "Hadid\u2019s graphic tee collection is extensive. In late October, the model stepped out wearing a hard-to-find shirt boasting a graphic from the cult-beloved \u201990s series Aeon Flux. She also has archival designer pieces on rotation, including a variety from Jean Paul Gaultier. When she wears a new tee, they often have a yesteryear retro feel, like the cutesy print T-shirt she wore this summer with a mushroom illustration or the style from her close friend Jesse Jo Stark that read \u201cDeadly Doll.\u201d On occasion, she\u2019ll even throw a jersey in the mix, either from the New York Giants or Alexander Wang. While I\u2019m not sure if Hadid is a Bj\u00f6rk fan, a Giants lover, or even likes mushrooms, it\u2019s nice to see that the model is having fun with her clothes.", "Photo: Courtesy of Getty Images"], "authors": ["Liana Satenstein", "Liana Satenstei"], "keywords": ["hadids", "model", "love", "collection", "shirt", "graphic", "tshirt", "wearing", "style", "tee", "stepped", "bella", "really", "print", "hadid"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
