Big firms were shrinking their capital bases by buying back shares. And fast-growing firms, including several hundred tech \u201cunicorns\u201d\u2014startups worth over $1bn\u2014chose to remain in private hands rather than bother with an initial public offering ( IPO ). The result was riskier corporate balance-sheets and the exclusion of ordinary investors from the ownership of the economy\u2019s most exciting firms.", "This year has seen a reversal of this trend with an equity-raising bonanza (see article). In the past few days Tesla has said it will sell $5bn of new shares, while DoorDash, a food-delivery company, raised $3.4bn in an IPO . In Hong Kong shares of JD Health, a digital-medicine star, rose by over 50% on their first day of trading after its $3.5bn IPO . As we went to press Airbnb, one of the largest unicorns, was listing at a valuation of over $40bn. Worldwide, some $800bn of equity has been raised in 2020 by non-financial firms, the highest sum on record. In America in the last quarter the proceeds should roughly match the amount of shares that companies have bought back.", "Equity is more expensive than borrowing, but has attractions. It is permanent capital that does not need to be repaid. And because it does not come with interest payments it is flexible, making firms more resilient. It is back in fashion for several reasons. Some firms need to repair the damage from the pandemic, for example Rolls-Royce, an aircraft-engine maker, and Carnival Cruises. The tech boom means unicorns can go public at sky-high valuations. Frothy share prices allow the founders of firms that are already listed to raise capital without diluting their own stake by as much\u2014something Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk has spotted.", "There are other factors, too. More Chinese firms are coming of age. This year Nongfu Spring, China\u2019s answer to Evian, floated, making its founder the country\u2019s richest man. Investors are experimenting with legal structures that they think are more efficient than IPO s, including SPAC s (special purpose acquisition companies). Finally, because covid-19 has led many firms to cut their buybacks there is less equity being retired than normal.", "Investors are euphoric but they face several risks. One is that prices are too high. Another is that it is not yet clear whether overall corporate indebtedness will fall, partly because the damage from lockdowns is still mounting. For non-financial companies in America\u2019s S & P 500 index, net debt (debt less cash) dropped only slightly in the third quarter of this year, and remains above its level in 2019. Some firms are still burning cash and perhaps a fifth of S&P 500 firms are overborrowed. As the pandemic abates, firms may reinstate buybacks and dividends.", "The last danger stems from a cohort of firms having too much cash. In the 1970s Michael Jensen, a scholar, argued that debt forced discipline on managers. His ideas were taken too far by Wall Street\u2019s junk-bond salesmen, but the risk of executives wasting cash on deals or vanity projects is real. The five biggest tech firms have over $550bn sitting around. They might try big takeovers\u2014think of Apple buying Netflix. Meanwhile, some newly listed firms have oodles of cash, but give outside investors only limited voting power, making managers unaccountable."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["investors", "markets", "ipo", "firms", "s", "making", "shares", "bonanza", "public", "cash", "tech", "debt"], "pubDate": "2020-12-12T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
