Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is promoting a new package of left-wing economic policies, including national rent control and expanding welfare to illegal immigrants across the country, as part of a massive new proposal aiming to achieve a \u201cjust society.\u201d", "The freshman lawmaker, who champions the multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposal to combat economic inequality and climate change, has now proposed a package of bills aimed at solving perceived economic injustice.", "OURBURST AT OCASIO-CORTEZ TOWN HALL WAS POLITICAL GROUP'S DOING, IT ADMITS", "\u201cA just society provides a living wage, safe working conditions, and healthcare. A just society acknowledges the value of immigrants to our communities.

Meanwhile, \u201cThe Embrace Act\u201d would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those immigrants here legally,", "\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any Federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual\u2019s immigration status,\u201d the bill reads.", "A federal public benefit is defined as: \u201cany grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and...any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.\u201d", "A similar bill \u201cThe Mercy in Re-entry Act\u201d uses similar language to stop the granting of public benefits based on whether a person was convicted of a criminal offense.", "Still another bill, \"The Recognizing Poverty Act,\" would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to update the federal poverty level by taking into account \u201cgeographic cost variation, costs related to health insurance, work expenses for the family, child care needs, and new necessities, like internet access.\u201d Another bill would urge the U.S. to ratify the U.N.\u2019s Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.", "It is unclear how such a radical package would go down in the Democrat-controlled House, while it would almost certainly be dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate.
