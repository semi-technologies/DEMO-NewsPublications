Unfortunately, it looks as though the driver overestimated how much space they had to maneuver.", "The footage was originally uploaded to YouTube on Oct. 16 by Remote Ally, a security camera company.

Oddly, instead of stopping, the vehicle keeps moving forward, hopping the curb possibly striking a small tree planted off the side.", "The truck backs up a little bit before pulling forward, once again hopping the curb. This time, it definitely hits a tree and may have struck a fence that\u2019s slightly off-camera. Meanwhile, a smaller car enters the drive-thru, seemingly unaware of the truck\u2019s predicament.", "FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS", "This causes further problems, as the vehicle can\u2019t complete the turn without the back of its trailer striking the car. The two vehicles begin backing up and rolling forward until the truck finally has enough space to get out of the drive-thru. It\u2019s unclear if the driver was hoping to place an order or if they were just passing through, but they definitely didn\u2019t leave with any food.", "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "\u201cFor your viewing pleasure!\" the YouTube caption read. \"Enjoy watching this semi-truck who got into a sticky situation in a Mcdonald's drive-thru.
