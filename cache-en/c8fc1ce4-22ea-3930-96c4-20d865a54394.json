They\u2019ve reduced choices for consumers, they stifled innovation and they degraded privacy protections for millions of Americans,\u201d she declared, summarising the accusations. Forty-five states joined her bipartisan coalition against the giant. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) sued Facebook for monopolistic practices in social-networking and demanded remedies including the firm\u2019s break-up.", "A few years ago co-ordinated action by 46 states and the FTC that could split Facebook apart was unthinkable, says Lina Khan, an antitrust scholar at Columbia Law School. But the case is about more than narrow competition law. The controversies around Facebook\u2019s privacy practices, the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories on the platform, and its exploitation by authoritarian regimes mean regulators and politicians are set on forcing change.", "Will they succeed? The cases look strong. Experts judge Facebook to be the lowest-hanging antitrust fruit, alongside Google (which America\u2019s Justice Department sued over alleged monopoly abuses in October). Amazon and Apple are in the crosshairs, but those cases will take longer, if they come at all, says an antitrust expert.", "Listen on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Google | Stitcher | TuneIn", "The Facebook lawsuits centre on its acquisitions. The firm maintained its monopoly in personal social-networking by systematically buying up potential competitors, both contend\u2014notably Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. A smoking gun could be Onavo, an Israeli firm Facebook bought in 2013\u2014to protect user data, the firm said. The suits claim it in fact used Onavo to track rival apps\u2019 popularity and select acquisition targets. Another alleged anti-competitive practice was blocking rival app developers from its platform. As consumer harm is hard to prove against big tech\u2019s mostly free products, the suits try a novel argument: that damage is done to users\u2019 privacy and advertisers\u2019 choice.", "Facebook will argue that its market is social media, which is broader and more competitive than social-networking. TikTok, a Chinese-owned short-video app, is now more popular than Instagram among American teenagers. The internal Facebook emails on which the lawsuits hinge hardly paint a picture of a lazy monopolist; Mr Zuckerberg and his lieutenants see competitive threats everywhere. Facebook can also argue that breaking it up is well-nigh impossible. Last year it started integrating Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger more deeply. And the FTC \u2019s complaint fails to mention it cleared the Instagram and WhatsApp deals. The government \u201cnow wants a do-over\u201d, sending a chilling warning to American business that \u201cno sale will ever be final\u201d, Facebook said.", "Markets shrugged off the news. Facebook\u2019s shares dipped by 2%, in line with the rest of big tech. Investors either see forced divestitures as unlikely, says Brent Thill of Jefferies, an investment bank\u2014or spy even more money to be made from spin-offs. \u25a0"], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["threats", "whatsapp", "alliance", "facebook", "privacy", "battle", "commences", "firm", "suits", "formidable", "socialnetworking", "takes", "instagram", "antitrust", "ftc"], "pubDate": "2020-12-12T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
