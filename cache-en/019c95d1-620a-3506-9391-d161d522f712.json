Donald Trump, less so. Over the past four years, he has compared intelligence agencies to Nazis, rubbished intelligence that displeased him and replaced professionals with unqualified sycophants. Doug Wise, a former deputy director of the Defence Intelligence Agency ( DIA ), calls Mr Trump \u201cthe global equivalent of an intelligence cancer\u201d, who has damaged morale within agencies and emboldened America\u2019s adversaries.", "The Biden administration will need to undo that damage, while also responding to emerging threats with a set of institutions often deemed too tied to outdated practices. Mr Biden\u2019s first steps are promising. He says he wants his national-security officials to \u201ctell me what I need to know, not what I want to know\u201d. The last two of Mr Trump\u2019s four directors of national intelligence ( DNI )\u2014a role created in the wake of the September 11th attacks to promote better information-sharing among the 17 entities comprising America\u2019s intelligence apparatus\u2014were a former ambassador and a three-term congressman, both of whom had negligible intelligence experience. They were there, according to Robert Cardillo, another former DIA deputy director, \u201cas yes-men to ensure the IC didn\u2019t give [Mr Trump] any trouble.\u201d", "Mr Biden nominated Avril Haines as DNI on November 24th. She was Barack Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser and deputy CIA director; John Brennan, her boss at CIA , praises her \u201chumility, interpersonal skills and tremendous capability,\u201d as well as a \u201cwork ethic...beyond peer\u201d. She vowed to \u201cspeak truth to power\u201d if confirmed. Her priority, according to Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, is \u201crestoring morale [and] reaffirming the notion that [analysts] speak the truth, even if it\u2019s not the administration\u2019s position.\u201d", "Undoing the damage abroad could prove trickier. On the one hand, intelligence sharing among the Five Eyes countries\u2014America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand\u2014proceeded more or less as usual during Mr Trump\u2019s tenure. The non-American intelligence agencies were occasionally more careful than usual in what they told the White House, to avoid triggering a presidential tantrum. Some worried that intelligence coming in the opposite direction may at times have been coloured by Mr Trump\u2019s political considerations. But intercepted communications are shared almost automatically. And Mr Cardillo says that most allies expressed \u201crelief\u201d when he told them: \u201cI get it, I know what\u2019s in the headlines and what you\u2019re seeing on Twitter, but we\u2019re still here, we still have this relationship.\u201d", "Trust funds", "On the other hand, many worry that Mr Trump\u2019s denigration of his own spies has emboldened America\u2019s adversaries. His carelessness with classified information\u2014early in his presidency he offhandedly divulged some to Russia\u2019s foreign minister\u2014may make it harder for America to attract would-be sources. The seasoned professionalism of the national-security team that Mr Biden has already assembled may calm some nerves, but restoring America\u2019s reputation for stability and care for its intelligence sources will take more than just words, and longer than just months.", "Yet it is challenges unrelated to Mr Trump that are likely to prove trickier. After two decades of relentless focus on counter-terrorism, the agencies are shifting resources and attention to \u201cgreat-power\u201d rivals, above all China. That requires different skills and capabilities than those wielded in the militarised war against jihadists. As Mr Warner notes, \u201cit\u2019s not just about who has the best rocket or submarine. Who\u2019s going to control the 5 G network? What will be the ethical and legal criteria around AI ?...We kind of fell asleep at the wheel, and China flooded the zone with engineers in standard-setting areas.\u201d", "If all that were not enough, intelligence agencies are also facing something akin to the problems media companies ran into when news moved from the printed page to the internet, and readers no longer needed a paper to give them information such as sports results or the next day\u2019s weather forecast. \u201cSeventy years ago when intelligence agencies were being set up, collecting and analysing secrets was deemed the best way to understand the world,\u201d says Carmen Medina, a former deputy director of intelligence at the CIA . Today, she says, \u201ca lot of the information that they stamp secret on, I can find anywhere else.\u201d", "Open-source intelligence, from commercial satellite imagery to social media, cannot substitute for the most hallowed sources\u2014an agent in the Kremlin, say\u2014but it offers insight without the encumbrances of classification. A new generation of officials and lawmakers have grown up in a world where they expect \u201canswers on demand\u201d, says Zachery Tyson, a former intelligence official at the Pentagon. \u201cThey are not going to use an IC where you have to go four floors down into the basement and log on to a secret computer with four different passwords to access a simple answer that you can approximate on Google.\u201d \u25a0", "Dig deeper:", "Read our latest coverage of the presidential transition, and then sign up for Checks and Balance, our weekly newsletter and podcast on American politics."], "authors": ["The Economist"], "keywords": ["biden", "americas", "shadow", "intelligence", "deputy", "life", "truth", "agencies", "trumps", "prepare", "trump", "mr", "director", "business"], "pubDate": "2020-12-05T00:00:00", "publicationId": "b7285ce8-a172-3053-b74d-7200a96bce26"}
