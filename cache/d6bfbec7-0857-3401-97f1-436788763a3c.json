While the actors are up there, working to make us feel, through their acute particularity, what it is to be human, we are down here, elbow to elbow with fidgeting, gum-chewing, symphonically coughing specimens of our own kind. The divide can seem vast\u2014one ringing phone can be enough to make you want to cancel everybody, everywhere\u2014and theatre-makers try to bridge it in all sorts of ways. They deconstruct the stage and break the famous fourth wall, enlisting audience members to participate in the action, to varying degrees of success. (I\u2019m thinking of the radically confrontational ending of Jackie Sibblies Drury\u2019s recent \u201cFairview\u201d\u2014and also, with pity, of the outraged theatregoer I saw complaining to an usher at Jeremy O. Harris\u2019s \u201cDaddy,\u201d after one of that production\u2019s numerous displays of simulated swimming-pool coitus left her soaked.) Or they may simply let the story lead, and trust in the power of performance to guide us.", "Jonathan Kent\u2019s restrained staging of \u201cThe Height of the Storm,\u201d by the French playwright Florian Zeller (a Manhattan Theatre Club production that has arrived at the Samuel J. Friedman after a heralded run in London), is as traditional as they come. The action is set in a grand, slightly shabby home in a suburb of Paris; the house lights are kept down, the audience members stowed safely in their seats, asked only to watch and listen. It is the play itself that lurches and rocks us, addling our expectation of narrative coherence in order to take us inside the sort of experience that can\u2019t be grasped with the mind alone.", "That experience belongs to Andr\u00e9 (Jonathan Pryce), an elderly writer in rapid mental decline. He stands in his kitchen, where the walls are painted a robin\u2019s-egg blue, looking out at a bare tree in his garden. His adult daughter Anne (Amanda Drew) is speaking, though he doesn\u2019t seem to notice her. There was a big storm in the night. Did he hear it? It kept her awake, but she\u2019s been having trouble sleeping anyway, because of \u201call this.\u201d It seems that Anne, pragmatic and weary, has come to help her father organize his affairs. There is interest in publishing his diaries, if he agrees. Then, there\u2019s the matter of the house, which may not be \u201cwhat the situation calls for.\u201d Anne has asked a real-estate agent to come by and have a little chat about selling. At this, Andr\u00e9 comes alive. He has an unstoppable tremor in his right hand, but when provoked he can still boom with Old Testament fury. And yet he seems to be in a state of confused denial\u2014about, we presume, the recent death of his wife of some fifty years, Madeleine, whom Anne speaks of in the past tense.", "Suddenly, here is the missing woman herself, briskly returning from a round of grocery shopping with Anne\u2019s flighty sister, \u00c9lise (Lisa O\u2019Hare). Have we misunderstood? Madeleine (Eileen Atkins) doesn\u2019t seem to be a ghost; her daughters speak to her as if nothing were out of the ordinary. At the sight of her, Andr\u00e9 comes alive again, if differently than before. He laughs and preens; his eyes shine as he teases his \u201clittle scorcher,\u201d though Madeleine swats away his flirtatious displays. She has lunch to prepare, and Andr\u00e9 seems to be coming unstuck again. He can\u2019t remember what day it is, and Anne\u2019s gentle answer\u2014\u201cToday, Dad\u201d\u2014tells us how far gone he really is. Or does it? As her mother chops onions, Anne again discusses the matter of the diaries, only now it is her father whom she speaks of in the past tense, before bursting into tears of grief. Is this an alternative scenario, in which Andr\u00e9, not Madeleine, is the dead parent? Or have Anne and Madeleine adopted this callous way of speaking about someone who is present in body but absent in mind\u2014as if he had vanished altogether?", "No clear answers are given during this intermissionless, eighty-minute piece. Like Andr\u00e9, who is sure of himself one moment, befuddled and pitiful the next, we are plunged into a shadowy, fearful place where reality, memory, and imagination mingle indiscriminately. Motifs are repeated in ways that contradict rather than amplify; the pauses between acts don\u2019t so much reset the action as muddle it, and us, further. (Hugh Vanstone\u2019s subtle lighting design does provide some clues as to who is flesh and who is figment.) The moments of greatest lucidity, like a quiet, companionable conversation between husband and wife at the kitchen table, may prove to be the most delusional, if they are, as increasingly seems to be the case, wishful fantasies that Andr\u00e9 uses to moor himself. But fantasy is not a bad place to go when reality proves unbearable. From the outside, dealing with dementia is a heartbreaking, exasperating task. I cringed, watching last year\u2019s production of Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s \u201cThe Waverly Gallery,\u201d to see the middle-aged Ellen (Joan Allen) blow her top when her mother, Gladys (the glorious Elaine May), asked, yet again, if the dog had been fed, but it was impossible to feel superior in the face of her exhaustion and sorrow. From the inside, Zeller\u2019s unstable, flickering play suggests, losing your mind may not be the worst that you can suffer. It\u2019s the effort to hold on to it that will bleed you dry."], "pubDate": null, "id": "d6bfbec7-0857-3401-97f1-436788763a3c", "keywords": ["wife", "madeleine", "asked", "place", "action", "storm", "anne", "unstable", "ways", "andr\u00e9", "flickering", "theatre", "come", "height"], "title": "The Unstable, Flickering \u201cThe Height of the Storm\u201d", "summary": "They deconstruct the stage and break the famous fourth wall, enlisting audience members to participate in the action, to varying degrees of success.\nOr they may simply let the story lead, and trust in the power of performance to guide us.\nHe laughs and preens; his eyes shine as he teases his \u201clittle scorcher,\u201d though Madeleine swats away his flirtatious displays.\nIs this an alternative scenario, in which Andr\u00e9, not Madeleine, is the dead parent?\nFrom the inside, Zeller\u2019s unstable, flickering play suggests, losing your mind may not be the worst that you can suffer.", "authors": ["Alexandra Schwartz", "Alice Munro", "Rachel Aviv", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Richard Brody", "Jane Mayer", "Vinson Cunningham"], "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
