The audience (Vogue editors and members of the Vogue100) were all over\u2014New York, Miami, London. Thanks to Zoom, Cowan was able to showcase his latest pieces to his eager viewers. Out of his hotel room at the Soho Berlin, Cowan and Vogue\u2019s Allie Michler led a conversation centered on cocktails and cocktail dresses.", "The hour-long event went like this. Cowan, who has just finished his Spring 2021 collection and wrapped on filming Germany\u2019s Next Top Model with Heidi Klum, was up late in his hotel room with a rack of his becrystalled look-at-me looks and Toni Dreher, an elegant model, at the ready to try them on.", "But first was a Q&A session led by Michler. Cowan, as a former CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists, was part of a fashion competition that helped to launch his career. Would he have done anything differently? \u201cI would say that I didn\u2019t need to turn my hair green,\u201d joked the designer, who sported a Billie Eilish-esque slime green \u2019do before the singer even came onto the scene throughout his time in the Fund.", "His looks are ones meant for the red carpet, and his fans are ones with Grammys, Oscars, and Tonys on their bookcases at home. What that means is Cowan is often creating one-of-a-kind pieces in addition to his ready-to-wear collections. How do the two processes differ? asked Michler.", "\u201cI love collaboration. You can see that through my career. I\u2019ve done a lot of collaborations, whether it\u2019s [with] artists or it\u2019s companies or whatever. I just think it\u2019s really fun. I think you learn more about your own creative process because you kind of push it into a different thing while you\u2019re working with someone else. So I love that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd different musicians work differently. So like Lady Gaga, she wants whatever you're going to give her. She\u2019s not asking for changes, I love it. But then with other people, it\u2019s a really collaborative process\u2014like Miley Cyrus, draws with you. She sends you sketches. I do quite enjoy that because you really feel like you\u2019re going on a journey together.\u201d", "All the while, guests were sipping on a very special Patr\u00f3n tequila that they were sent in advance to enjoy in unison. \u201cCheers!\u201d would take on like a wave at a sporting event every once in a while as a guest raised his or her cocktail to the screen.", "After the Q&A, Dreher slipped into Cowan\u2019s creations. What proceeded was a mini-fashion show with Dreher serving looks into Cowan\u2019s laptop and the designer walking us through them. This one featured Swarovski crystals in the shape of fireworks because florals, per the designer, were not groundbreaking. Another one, a jacket with billowing sleeves, featured \u201ca lot of yardage\u2014they're like 50 pleats in each one,\u201d he said.", "Before Cowan bid us all gute nacht, he took a moment to speak on the Loveland Foundation. In collaboration with Lil Nas X, sales from Cowan\u2019s Spring 2021 collection\u2014which featured a campaign starring the likes of Marc Jacobs and Amanda Lepore\u2014will benefit the nonprofit, which provides support to communities of color.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been very honored and privileged to work with the Loveland Foundation,\u201d Cowan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a foundation set up by Rachel Cargle, who\u2019s done amazing work in the Black Lives Matter field and I have looked up to her for ages\u2014she\u2019s just fabulous.\u201d He continued, \u201cI feel like often younger brands think that they can\u2019t do philanthropy because they don\u2019t have excess cash. But the thing is, you can always partner with someone else to get it to the charities you care about. There\u2019s never really an excuse. We did it with the Powerpuff Girls for a long time. And then we did it with Lil Nas X in this recent collaboration.\u201d", "", "Cowan went on to explain that he had established a fund with Loveland to help combat violence against trans youths in Atlanta, Lil Nas X\u2019s hometown. \u201cAll the proceeds\u2014from the retail line, to the trunk show, to everything\u2014are going toward that fund,\u201c he said. \u201cSo it feels really special. It\u2019s really nice to do a fabulous collection.\u201d"], "authors": ["Lilah Ramzi", "Lilah Ramz"], "keywords": ["latest", "cowan", "presentation", "collection", "youre", "think", "nas", "love", "christian", "vogue100", "hosted", "work", "loveland", "virtual", "really", "designer", "looks"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
