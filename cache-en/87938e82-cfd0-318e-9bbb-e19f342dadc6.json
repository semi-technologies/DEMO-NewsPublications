The hair is a little greyer and the first thing he says as he takes his seat is that the situation is \u201ccomplicated\u201d, leaving no room for bombastic promises or grand statements. No point, either. \u201cVoters will reward seriousness, rigour, experience and knowledge,\u201d he says. And yet there\u2019s still a glint in his eye, the familiar hint of mischief.", "It is here in this sparse room above his campaign HQ at the Moritz beer factory in Barcelona, and it is there the following morning, 600km away in Madrid. A giant banner with his face on covers the fa\u00e7ade of a 15-floor building on the corner of Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Street, right by the home of their greatest rivals and the scene of his greatest night: the 6-2 against Real Madrid in 2009. \u201cLooking forward to seeing you again,\u201d the message runs. All it lacks is a winking emoji. So much for no grand statements.", "Barcelona take down leaders Sociedad while Ronaldo penalty costs Juventus Read more", "In the capital, many didn\u2019t see the funny side. In Catalonia, many more did. Some enjoyed the ballsiness, the glimpse of the provocative president he was before and the threat his appearance represented to their rivals, how offended some were.", "The banner broke from the studied seriousness, and the favourite for the elections, V\u00edctor Font, insisted: \u201cIn these things he\u2019s the master but banners don\u2019t win you Champions Leagues, build a stadium, or fix the debt.\u201d Yet the emotional impact was huge, the reaction massive, Laporta thrust centre-stage, and it may work. Besides, however conciliatory he\u2019s been since announcing his candidacy, maybe he can\u2019t help himself. If he could maybe he wouldn\u2019t even be here.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Joan Laporta\u2019s electoral poster on the corner of Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Street, with Real Madrid\u2019s stadium in the background. Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters", "Barcelona are in crisis. Whoever wins these elections \u2013 and there are eight men trying to gather sufficient signatures to stand, with Laporta and Font the favourites \u2013 will inherit players, a manager and a mess. The admitted debt is \u20ac488m. There is a stadium to build, a loan from Goldman Sachs to be repaid. Wages have been deferred, another problem handed to the new president. And the team are in trouble.", "As for Laporta, the charisma and easy charm is still there, no sign of him slowing down, but it\u2019s still hard to imagine the energy of 2003 and harder to imagine equalling that era. There\u2019s no Johan Cruyff to guide him, no Pep Guardiola to manage for him, and maybe no Lionel Messi, either. In short, is he mad? Why go back?", "\u201cMaybe that\u2019s the way I am,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest challenge of my life: I know that, accept it, I\u2019m ready. Maybe it\u2019s about where you place a club like Barcelona among the things you value. I\u2019ve been going since I was five, my dad and grandad made me a member at 10 and the club\u2019s values have always been present in my life \u2013 not just football but everything else it represents, more important now than ever. We want people to fall in love with Barcelona again.", "\u201cDestiny seems to want me to be involved in some of the club\u2019s most difficult moments; that\u2019s my fate. I don\u2019t feel an obligation, just motivation. I still think I\u2019ve got the energy. Messi: we still have him. Johan: I always have Johan with me, because of everything I learned, all he taught. And with Pep I have an open line.\u201d", "You talk to him. \u201cYes.\u201d Did you try to convince him to come? \u201cNo. He\u2019s a friend and he also happens to be the world\u2019s best coach but I knew his situation at City.\u201d", "In two weeks Messi can formally negotiate with other clubs and City is a potential destination. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he has [made up his mind],\u201d Laporta says. \u201cI think he\u2019ll weigh up all the options. Messi loves Bar\u00e7a, and I think he\u2019ll consider the proposal the new Barcelona president makes him. I could see it coming because what most upsets Leo is that they lied to him. He\u2019s told me: \u2018You never lied to me; you fulfilled your promises.\u2019 I could see that his relationship with the directors was getting worse: they made him carry responsibility for everything. He didn\u2019t have to put up with that. If I become president, then I\u2019ll speak to him.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Joan Laporta with Leo Messi after the forward signed a contract extension in 2009. Photograph: FC Barcelona/EPA", "Why not now? \u201cLeo knows,\u201d Laporta says. \u201cHe knows what I think. I can only imagine him in a Barcelona shirt and I\u2019ll do everything possible to ensure he continues. I know Leo and what he\u2019s interested in is winning. The best players see immediately if the team is competitive. It\u2019s not about money, never has been; if it had, he would have taken very different decisions throughout his career. We have work hard to continue that beautiful story: Leo Messi and Barcelona.", "\u201cWhen the world\u2019s best player has to watch other clubs lift the European Cup, you know things have been done wrong. We left the best legacy you could leave in 2010: a competitive team with a long way still to go, a healthy economy and without sponsorship on the shirt. But they constantly looked back, driven by rancour, and ruined the sporting project, failing to renew it in time.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Joan Laporta says Ronald Koeman deserves to continue as manager to the end of the season. Photograph: Pablo Garcia", "\u201cIn fairness, I went through that, so can understand it. I had a year of complacency [in 2007-2008]: You think: \u2018Bloody hell, we\u2019ve won everything, we don\u2019t need to change, don\u2019t need a new cycle.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t go well. When we realised, we changed Frank [Rijkaard] for Pep, Ronaldinho for Messi, Deco for Xavi and Iniesta. We convinced the coach to stick with Eto\u2019o.\u201d", "A vote of no confidence in Josep Maria Bartomeu swept him aside early. January, seven days from the close of the transfer window, is not an ideal time for elections, nor is the midst of a pandemic. The room for manoeuvre is minuscule and there is no money. The candidates don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll find: there are contracts to be studied, avenues to be explored, some unpleasant surprises perhaps lying in wait.", "Laporta talks of a \u201cplan de choque\u201d, emergency measures, but change can\u2019t be implemented immediately and he is short on details, a full project yet to be presented. This morning, he has been discussing the new sporting director. \u201cThere are three candidates, and I like all three,\u201d he says. He is cautious on Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, Font\u2019s preferred coach. He says that Ronald Koeman deserves time, to continue to the end of the season. And insists: \u201cI have got nothing hidden up my sleeve [as a signing].\u201d", "Joan Laporta: \u2018Barcelona has been kidnapped. It\u2019s hostage to lies and it\u2019s sad\u2019 Read more", "He laughs. \u201cAnd if I have anything to say it will be at the right time.\u201d There\u2019s that hint of mischief again, and then he\u2019s serious once more.", "\u201cI\u2019ve lived this before. The challenge is similar to what we faced in 2003, although not on the same scale. Back then it was \u20ac123m in revenue, \u20ac192m in expenses, a badly structured team and a divided club. Renewing the team was maybe easier then than now because in order to reduce this season\u2019s costs they\u2019ve kicked the problem of players\u2019 contracts up the road for the incoming board to fix. We have to see the exact numbers but it doesn\u2019t look good. But I don\u2019t want to be alarmist, or act the victim. This all needs to be analysed, we need to look for solutions.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ansu Fati in action for Barcelona against Real Betis last month. \u2018The idea is for great players to stay,\u2019 says Joan Laporta. Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters", "Does that involve selling players? \u201cIt involves reducing the costs, increasing income beyond traditional means, and restructuring the debts,\u201d Laporta says. Yet he also says: \u201cPeople like to say, \u2018We\u2019re not a selling club\u2019, but that\u2019s a mistake: you have to buy and sell well.\u201d", "Ansu Fati, then? \u201cI like him a lot,\u201d Laporta says, but he stops short of an outright hands off, for him or anyone. \u201cHe has a huge potential for growth and I would like that to be in Barcelona. The idea is for great players to stay.\u201d", "One revenue stream is a Super League, previous president Josep Maria Bartomeu\u2019s parting shot, but it is not one Laporta embraces with enthusiasm. \u201cEvery proposal will be analysed and decisions made based on Barcelona\u2019s interests and the interests of football.
