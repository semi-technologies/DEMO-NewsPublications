The author, a foreign correspondent who was based in Pakistan for almost a decade, here tells the story of this complicated nation through some of its most influential personalities, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, its founder; the human-rights activist Asma Jahangir; and the legendary spy Sultan Amir Tarar. Equally perceptive about the megacities of Karachi and Lahore and the remote regions of Waziristan and Balochistan, Walsh portrays a Pakistan that is \u201cmore concept than country . . . strained under the centrifugal forces of history, identity and faith.\u201d After examining the legacy of partition, the grip of the Taliban, and a web of ethnic and sectarian fault lines, Walsh concludes that \u201cthe most pertinent question might be not whether Pakistan will fail, but how it has survived this long.\u201d", "Oak Flat, by Lauren Redniss (Random House). The value of time is at the heart of this illustrated nonfiction book, which blends reportage, oral history, and cosmology in an account of conflict over a copper mine in southeastern Arizona. The mine will cause Oak Flat\u2014an ancient burial ground and religious site of the San Carlos Apache\u2014to collapse into a crater a thousand feet deep. Redniss focusses on Naelyn Nosie, a self-proclaimed \u201cmodern day Apache female warrior,\u201d whose family has lived on a reservation for generations, and on the Gorham family, for whom the new mine promises relief from years of hardship. The narrative resists oversimplification and draws out points of connection among people thrown into opposition by circumstance.", "Nights When Nothing Happened, by Simon Han (Riverhead). This suspenseful d\u00e9but novel opens in a middle-class suburban neighborhood in Texas. The members of the Cheng family, having arrived from China at different times, are wildly disconnected. The career-oriented mother came first, followed by her aimless husband, while their son stayed behind with grandparents. Only Annabel, the youngest, was born in the U.S., and her empowered outlook clashes with the rest of the family\u2019s determination to tread lightly and fit in. Han switches nimbly among family members\u2019 perspectives, and tensions culminate at a potluck hosted out of obligation, \u201cfor to cancel a party was to announce to your guests that something was wrong.\u201d", "At Night All Blood Is Black, by David Diop, translated from the French by Anna Moschovakis (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Alfa Ndiaye, the narrator of this mystical novel, is a Senegalese soldier during the First World War. Recruited by the French Army to \u201cplay the savage,\u201d he sneaks into the \u201cblue-eyed enemy\u201d encampment every night, returning with a severed hand from each kill. He sees the attacks, which earn him a fearsome reputation, as avenging the death of a friend, but they exact a psychological toll. Hospitalized, he is made to draw, an activity that unleashes memories of his childhood in colonial Senegal, reveals parallels between his parents\u2019 suffering and his own, and brings a deepening confrontation with a heritage of brutality."], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "keywords": ["french", "walsh", "reviews", "night", "history", "book", "pakistan", "members", "briefly", "redniss", "family", "novel", "noted", "han"], "pubDate": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "publicationId": "7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35"}
