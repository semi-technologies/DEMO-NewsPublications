This less-than-glamorous sartorial turn was not the result of a style rut, per se, but rather a subconscious (okay, it was pretty intentional) response to many mornings spent agonizing over what to wear to work. Not caring about how I looked or what trend I needed to adhere to was relieving, and something about putting together a full look just didn\u2019t feel right. For nearly six months, my floral dresses, frilled blouses, and lace-up boots have been sitting untouched in the back of my closet.", "As is the case with most quarantine-appropriate activities\u2014watercolor painting, baking, putting together puzzles\u2014my aversion to real clothes began to grow old after a while. In September, with the promise of fall on the horizon and a hint of back-to-school nostalgia, I made a promise to myself that I would start dressing up again. With that, I also decided that I wanted to switch up my style overall. B.C. (Before Coronavirus) I was a major fan of seasonal and trend-driven dressing. This included bright florals in the warmer months and heavier fabrics mixed with prairie-core vibes in the fall and winter. But the tumult of quarantine left me yearning for structure and, therefore, a new wardrobe that was less about bold patterns and rich fabrics and more minimalistic and streamlined.", "When getting dressed earlier this fall, I began to rely heavily on classic staples. These were pieces that I already owned and items that could carry me through the coming season without too many styling variations. I took to wearing rigid jeans, a Breton striped shirt, loafers, and simple button-down shirts. Now, I\u2019m still wearing these chic, easy ensembles, but I\u2019ve realized that making the switch has proven to be more difficult than anticipated, especially during sale season. But while I still love a good vibrant print or playful embellishment, these classics that I\u2019ve adopted into my everyday-style repertoire will definitely remain on heavy rotation for months to come."], "authors": ["Charlotte Diamond", "Charlotte Diamon"], "keywords": ["switch", "putting", "classics", "promise", "style", "ive", "months", "week", "embraced", "vogue", "season", "editor", "fabrics", "fall", "wearing"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
