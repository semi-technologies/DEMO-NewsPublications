The entire paddock and viewers around the world held their breath when the French driver smashed into trackside barriers, his car splitting in two and being engulfed in flames. The visceral, violent and horrifying scale of the accident was sickening and yet Grosjean emerged relatively unscathed, a remarkable testament to the drive for safety the sport has relentlessly pursued.", "Such is F1\u2019s recent safety record the perception of motorsport\u2019s extraordinary danger has perhaps been diminished. With Grosjean hurtling through the brutal moments of distorting metal and fiery heat, the notion was dispelled completely.", "Romain Grosjean's 'life saved' by halo after remarkable escape at Bahrain GP Read more", "Lewis Hamilton, who went on to win, had made a clean start from pole but on the opening lap behind him, Grosjean, who drives for Haas, had suffered the huge accident going straight into the barrier at 137mph at turn three. His car was engulfed in a fireball, which burned fiercely and was still on fire when he climbed from the wreckage. Grosjean had been in the flames for 18 seconds.", "The French driver exited his cockpit, leaping over the crumpled barriers after the most serious accident the sport has seen since Jules Bianchi\u2019s crash at Suzuka in October 2014, the injuries from which led to his death the next July. Grosjean was lucky to be alive after what had been an extremely unusual incident, given how rare it is for modern cars to catch fire.", "He had come across the track and clipped Daniil Kvyat, causing him to veer at high speed over a very short run-off area. His car speared into the steel barrier and completely sheared in half, allowing fuel to escape. Grosjean was in the front half of the car, which punched through the barrier, a severe impact in which his life was almost certainly saved by the halo cockpit protection device. Remarkably the 34-year-old had only sustained burns to his hands and ankles. He was taken by helicopter to hospital with suspected broken ribs.", "The Haas team principal, Guenther Steiner, confirmed his driver had escaped lightly. \u201cRomain is good, he will stay in hospital overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is broken, he has his hands bandaged from the burns but he was very upbeat.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lewis Hamilton looks reserved beneath his car\u2019s halo, after his victory. The device is thought to have played a key part in helping Romain Grosjean survive his crash. Photograph: Getty Images", "F1\u2019s protocols for race safety had proved invaluable. Dr Ian Roberts and the driver Alan van der Merwe, who are in the medical car which follows behind the grid after the start, were vital in helping Grosjean. They were swiftly on the scene, helping him to escape and extinguishing the fire alongside the marshals, who also reacted swiftly.", "Steiner quickly went to find and thank Roberts and Van der Merwe. \u201cIf you see the barrier it is unbelievable, we were lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got away with it, I think. I would like to thank all the marshals. They did a fantastic job to get him away as quick as possible from the fire. It was amazing what they did.\u201d", "Van der Merwe, a South African former racer who has been driving the medical car since 2009, emphasised how F1\u2019s pursuit of safety measures had proved themselves. \u201cI have never seen that much fire and an impact like that in 12 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes to show all the systems we have developed \u2013 everything worked hand in hand. The halo, the barriers, the seatbelts, everything worked as it should. Without one of those things it could have been a very different outcome.\u201d", "Quick guide How Grosjean's life was saved Show Hide Romain Grosjean\u2019s life was almost certainly saved by the halo protection device. The cockpit itself is designed and tested to great extremes to act as a survival cell in the case of major accidents. The halo is a titanium hoop structure which sits over the cockpit designed to protect he driver\u2019s head and was introduced in 2018. It was greeted with some resistance and scepticism, with concerns that drivers would have difficulty quickly extricating themselves from a car in the event of a fire. Drivers do practise the procedure, including proving they can remove themselves within 10 seconds. The violence of the impact and the height of the car entering the barriers would have left Grosjean\u2019s head completely exposed to the steel barriers without the halo and his swift exit proved it was not an encumbrance. Other essential kit Fireproof suits Inner layer including balaclava made of artificial fibre Nomex, resists ignition for 10 seconds. Nomex race suit has same properties. Survival cell Carbon fibre and a layer of Kevlar surround the driver. Designed to absorb energy, it also includes automatic fire-suppression system. Medical car Follows the grid after start. So driver Alan van der Merwe and Dr Ian Roberts arrived within seconds and, with marshals, helped Grosjean escape.", "The role the halo protection device played was crucial. It had been resisted by some on aesthetic grounds when it was introduced in 2018 but this crash has proved beyond any doubt its worth. Grosjean\u2019s head would have been completely exposed to a frontal impact with the barriers through which his car passed but the halo acted to force the metal up and away from his head creating a crucial gap.", "With the race stopped, there was clear shock and concern across the paddock as the drivers and teams saw the incident replayed. Their relief at Grosjean\u2019s escape was palpable.", "Formula 1 (@F1) We are so thankful that Romain Grosjean was able to walk away from this. We did not need a reminder of the bravery and brilliance of our drivers, marshals, and medical teams, nor of the advances in safety in our sport, but we truly got one today#BahrainGP \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\udded #F1 pic.twitter.com/z8OeTU5Nem", "F1 has seen few incidents of similar violence in recent years. In 1981 John Watson\u2019s McLaren spun backwards in to the wall at Monza, splitting his car in two. He, too, was protected by a new safety development \u2013 the carbon-fibre monocoque from which today\u2019s cockpit survival cell has developed. In 1990 Martin Donnelly\u2019s Lotus hit the barriers at Jerez at 140mph, tearing his chassis in half and throwing the driver from the wreckage, an incident he, too, was lucky to survive. It was Bianchi\u2019s crash at Suzuka that had prompted the FIA to investigate adopting a cockpit protection device.", "Hamilton emphasised the sense of relief across the paddock. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful Romain is safe,\u201d he wrote on social media. \u201cThe risk we take is no joke, for those of you out there that forget that we put our life on the line for this sport and for what we love to do. Thankful to the FIA for the massive strides we\u2019ve taken for Romain to walk away from that safely.\u201d", "With the twisted wreckage of the Armco barriers replaced by concrete blocks, racing resumed an hour and a half later. There was no holding back by the drivers despite the horrific nature of the accident they had witnessed but the race, as it has so many times this season, belonged to Hamilton. In control throughout, he led to the flag with ease to deliver another dominant win, ahead of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and his teammate Alex Albon."], "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "keywords": ["grosjeans", "bahrain", "barriers", "overshadowed", "hamiltons", "win", "huge", "romain", "driver", "lewis", "drivers", "gp", "halo", "grosjean", "car", "cockpit", "safety", "crash"], "pubDate": "2020-11-29T00:00:00", "publicationId": "c9a0e53b-93fe-38df-a6ea-4c8ff4501783"}
