Redwoods and sequoias, he said, \u201cstore more carbon per acre than any other forest system in the world, by a long shot.\u201d", "Research has indicated that there have been centuries of regular fires in redwood forests, sometimes every decade or two and most likely set by indigenous people looking to occasionally clear space for other plants. It is unusual to find an old-growth redwood without obvious fire scars at the base.", "Redwoods, unlike their cousin the giant sequoia, can resprout from their roots, a key to their regeneration.", "As if to provide more proof of its resilience, even when a redwood is chopped down it is not always defeated. Dead redwoods often sprout several more trees around the stump, a \u201cfairy ring\u201d that defines second-growth forests.", "But those next-generation forests have less fire tolerance than old-growth forests, with their lower canopies and thinner bark.", "And since redwoods share the forests with a broad range of species, from deciduous oaks to Douglas firs, the land can be thick with vulnerable trees and underbrush \u2014 potential fuels that can feed ever-bigger blazes.", "Among the growing concerns is sudden-oak death, creating the potential for more deadwood to burn among the redwoods, not unlike the drought-stricken fallen pines now fueling fires in sequoia groves.", "\u201cLike a lot of California, our redwood forests are pretty departed from their historical condition and their more fire-resilient conditions,\u201d Ms. Quinn-Davidson said. \u201cAll this brush, the understory, all the thick duff and fuels \u2014 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they looked like, historically, when they had more frequent fire.\u201d", "Big Basin may look that way in a few years.
