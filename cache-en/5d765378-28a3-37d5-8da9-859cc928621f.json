One in 10 people have had the virus in Bastwell, where 85.7% of residents come from a BAME background \u2013 four times higher than a neighbourhood five miles away where only 2% of people are non-white.", "Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service and chair of the 2070 commission into city and regional inequalities in the UK, said the findings proved \u201cCovid has not been a leveller. Nor has the economic fallout been a leveller.\u201d", "He called on the government to \u201cget behind a proper examination of the issues of how Covid has impacted on inequality, particularly on the delivery of their levelling up agenda\u201d and added: \u201cIt\u2019s made the task harder of levelling up but also made it more urgent. And the truth is, we don\u2019t have a levelling up plan from the government, we don\u2019t have a cabinet minister \u2026 we simply don\u2019t have a level of leadership with this agenda.\u201d", "The link between deprivation, ethnicity and an increased risk from Covid-19 has been well established, with black African men nearly four times more likely to die from the disease than white men, according to the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics.", "The Guardian analysis shows for the first time how these disparities exist even among communities living side by side. It drills down to more than 300 neighbourhoods comprising nearly 2.7 million people in England\u2019s 10 local authorities with the highest infection rates, almost all of which are post-industrial towns in the north-west.", "It found that across England, average salary was likely to indicate an area\u2019s infection rate, meaning places with higher average earnings were more likely to have fewer Covid-19 cases. But in the 10 worst-hit local authorities, an area\u2019s proportion of BAME residents had a stronger correlation to its case rate, compared with salary, age and deprivation.", "In these 10 worst-hit councils, the 26 areas with a majority of BAME residents and an average salary of below \u00a325,000 had experienced 7.1 cases per 100 people. This is almost double the average rate in the 22 mostly white areas where most people earn more than \u00a335,000 a year.", "The data, published by Public Health England and running to 25 November, reveals that the huge disparities in Blackburn with Darwen are repeated across the north-west of England and West Yorkshire. In Oldham, infection rates vary from 10.1% to 3.5% in 100 depending on deprivation, ethnicity and average earnings; in Bradford, from 9.3% to 1.5%; and in Manchester, from 15.4% to 3.3% in 100.", "Tim Elwell-Sutton, an assistant director of the Health Foundation, described the findings as \u201cvery stark\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re seeing areas right next to each other having very different experiences of the pandemic and that bring things home.\u201d", "Residents from a BAME background are more likely to live in cramped housing with several generations under one roof, working in public-facing jobs in healthcare, hospitality or warehouses, and are more likely to use public transport, experts have said, increasing their exposure to Covid-19.", "\u201cAt least in part, these factors are a consequence of structural racism and it has left ethnic minorities more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic and could have been predicted,\u201d said Elwell-Sutton.", "He urged ministers to put health inequalities at the heart of the government\u2019s levelling up agenda, arguing that the focus on infrastructure and the economy risked leaving structural issues as \u201cthe preserve of the Department of Health\u201d.", "He added: \u201cIf we\u2019d been healthier at the start of the pandemic we would have done much better and particularly if that gap between the most and least deprived wasn\u2019t as big then we would have found it easier to weather this.\u201d", "Kerslake said the government needed to invest not only in infrastructure but also skills and combating deprivation, and properly fund local authorities to rebuild public health capacity. \u201cIf you were to pick out one thing that left us much more vulnerable to this pandemic it has been the denuding of resources for public health and local authorities,\u201d he said. A failure to do so posed a \u201creal risk\u201d that existing health inequalities would widen, he warned.", "Prof Dominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council, said his area had suffered a \u201cdouble whammy pandemic effect\u201d, which he said was worsening the health and economic costs.", "Residents and businesses urgently needed more financial help from the Treasury, he said, adding that more deprived areas to be prioritised for the vaccine when it is rolled out more widely early next year. He called for a longer-term plan to move new middle class jobs to struggling northern towns post-Brexit.", "\u201cThe inequalities revealed by this analysis absolutely confirm our own local analysis,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWe have higher Covid rates due to higher structural risks, so we risk being in tier 3 for longer, possibly months, and so our local economy is massively more impacted.
