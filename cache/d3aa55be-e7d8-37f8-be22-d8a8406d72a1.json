That gives Democratic candidates the lead in each of the possible 2020 matchups tested in a Fox News Poll of Wisconsin registered voters.", "Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll\u2019s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way.", "Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.", "CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS", "The Democratic candidates mostly owe their advantage to women voters and those with a college degree. Trump does best among white men without a degree and white evangelical Christians.", "\u201cWisconsin is a tough nut for Republicans and the president has an uphill climb,\u201d says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \u201cHe needs to reassure rural voters who are spooked by the tariffs while persuading suburban voters to buy into his low tax/pro-growth economic vision.\u201d", "Trump won rural voters by 27 points in 2016. They now back him over Biden by only 2 points.", "By a 19-point margin Wisconsin voters think tariffs hurt rather than help the economy, and more oppose building a wall along the southern border by 10 points.", "Those favoring the wall prefer Trump by 73 points, while those opposed go for Biden by 76.", "Voters who say tariffs hurt the economy prefer Biden by a 61-point margin. Those who think tariffs help support Trump by 65.", "Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, making him the first Republican to win the state since 1984.
