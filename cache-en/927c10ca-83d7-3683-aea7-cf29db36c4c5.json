Her Majesty is a devotee of the brand Launer, and The Crown stays true to history, featuring her favorite styles from the British heritage brand, the Traviata and the Bellini. (Fun fact: Margaret Thatcher also had a penchant for the impeccably crafted Launer bags, but she was most photographed carrying the Olympia style.) From my research, it turns out the queen often uses her purse as a signal to the people around her that she\u2019s ready to leave one place and head to another. Grab the bag, and it\u2019s time to go. Some sites even go as far as to speculate on my most important query: the contents. Apparently, Her Majesty carries around some mix of a compact, a lipstick, some tissues, mints, corgi treats, reading glasses, a diary, and a fountain pen\u2014all useful things no matter where one is. All the articles I read remarked emphatically, in varying ways, that the queen would never go anywhere without her handbag.", "So, I\u2019ve decided to give it a try. Why not? I\u2019ve always been fond of a timeless, top-handle bag, and so I pulled out my more pint-to-medium-size ladylike options, which had been gathering a bit of dust since I started hunkering down at home last March. I settled on an off-white, lizard-embossed Little Liffner minimalist mini tote that would normally be a great not-too-fancy-but-certainly-brought-out-for-some-sort-of-occasion bag. To be honest, I\u2019ve actually found it quite useful to have my lip balm and glasses (to borrow a couple of items from the queen\u2019s list) in one reliable place instead of haphazardly placed around my apartment. I also added my credit card (which I am constantly leaving in the pocket of my pants or jackets), a hair tie, and some hand cream to combat the hand sanitizer that lives in my XL grocery-shopping carryall. Of course, I also really can\u2019t wait to try to use it as a signal that I\u2019m about to leave, even if it\u2019s just a wave of the top handle to sign out of a Zoom meeting.", "As much as a bag is about function, it\u2019s also just about investing in the kind of fashion that sparks joy. It\u2019s the little things these days, right? Having a bag next to me while I\u2019ve worked from home these last couple of days has not only been helpful but also a bit soothing\u2014a pretty object that I fell immediately back into reaching for as if the reflex had just returned from vacation. I can understand why a woman who is constantly being watched by those around her would also want to have this kind of prop as something to hold, move, use. Plus, when they are only for short trips indoors, the possibilities are endless. Personally, now that I\u2019ve practiced with it, I\u2019m not letting myself be afraid anymore of white leather\u2014a material I certainly wouldn\u2019t have allowed myself in the wild before. I won\u2019t be carrying around any fountain pens, though. That seems like something only an incredibly graceful woman, or a queen, could get away with without tempting fate.", "Shop my favorite royal-inspired purses below\u2014for home and beyond.", "Little Liffner minimal mini tote in light beige lizard $385 LITTLE LIFFNER Shop Now Launer Traviata leather top handle bag $2,125 SELFRIDGES Shop Now", "Hunting Season small top handle leather shoulder bag $565 $282 THE OUTNET Shop Now By Far mini croc emossed leather top handle bag $562 NORDSTROM Shop Now", "Coach Swinger bag $195 COACH Shop Now Tory Burch Lee Radziwill small bag $898 $539 TORY BURCH Shop Now", "Gucci Jackie 1961 mini hobo bag $1,980 GUCCI Shop Now Simon Miller mini retro bag $250 SIMON MILLER Shop Now", "Medea tote bag $563 $486 FARFETCH Shop Now Staud Jackie bag in ivy croc embossed $350 STAUD Shop Now", "Oroton Hazel mini frame bag $399 SHOPBOP Shop Now Khaite Agnes small leather tote $1,880 NET-A-PORTER Shop Now", "Mark Cross small grace box bag $2,290 $1,832 LUISAVIAROMA Shop Now Il Bisonte structured leather satchel bag $680 BERGDORF GOODMAN Shop Now"], "authors": ["Willow Lindley", "Willow Lindle"], "keywords": ["tote", "queen", "handle", "small", "majesty", "ive", "whats", "little", "mini", "leather", "bag", "shop"], "pubDate": null, "publicationId": "ac884d35-ccb4-3937-81f8-8474a4d7a549"}
