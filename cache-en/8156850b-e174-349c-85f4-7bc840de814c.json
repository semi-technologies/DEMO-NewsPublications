We're working on a vehicle that will carry three people to 7,500 feet and we're continuing with a vehicle that will dive to 4,000 meters and carry two people in an even thicker haul. So it's an exciting time that we're living in.\"", "Demand for submersibles has grown considerably over the years, with more and more mega-yacht owners seeking out the vessels as a means of entertaining family and friends while at sea.", "Although nature documentaries like \"Blue Planet\" have no doubt helped, Lahey credits the early pioneers of submarine tourism, such as US businessman Victor Vescovo, who commissioned a Triton 36,000/2 sub for a 2018 diving expedition to the deepest parts of each of the world's five oceans, for demonstrating their capabilities.", "\"The conversation has changed,\" he explains. \"When we first came onto the scene 15 years ago, the idea of a submersible on a yacht was almost ridiculed.", "\"People didn't think it was a good idea at all, largely because their perception of what a submersible was was wrong. They thought it'd be complicated, unreliable and scary.\"", "According to Lahey, the \"early adopters\" have proven that subs provide great experiences and are also simple to operate and easy to maintain.", "'Salon under the sea'", "The luxury vessel has a 360-degree window and 'club class seating'.
