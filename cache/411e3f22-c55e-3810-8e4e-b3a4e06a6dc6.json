So I partly moved here because I knew there was something like that here. And I met a number of writers here, including Don Webb, and ultimately Bruce, and Jessica Reisman and others, and that really was my gateway to the wider community of science fiction writers and readers who participate actively in fandom.\u201d", "Christopher Brown on Rule of Capture:", "\u201cThe US has lost a war with China\u2014not a long drawn-out war, a pretty quick conflict that\u2019s mostly been orbital\u2014but one that has resulted in the humiliation of a country that previously was kind of a dominant imperial power, and is subjected to treaty accords and austerity programs and things like that, the kind of circumstance that both opens up the window of the politically possible, but also provides a fertile ground for the ferment of ultranationalism. \u2026 So the idea is that, in many respects, it kind of feels like Germany in the late \u201920s or early \u201930s, during the Weimer years, or kind of like Chile and Argentina were right before the outbreaks of their respective dirty wars\u2014something that I have some experience with through family.\u201d", "Christopher Brown on lawyers:", "\u201cI was in the middle of [writing Tropic of Kansas], and I went for a coffee break, and I was standing there\u2014getting in my car, with my coffee\u2014by the side of the highway, and I look up, and there\u2019s this billboard\u2014here in Texas, where lawyer ads flourish like prickly pear\u2014and it\u2019s a very Austin sort of lawyer marketing.

And I was looking at that guy, and he\u2019s got a coat and tie and a biker jacket, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Who are the lawyers in a dystopia?
