But the residents of Atherton will be first to say that their little leafy community at the heart of Silicon Valley \u2013 home to tech billionaires, venture capitalists, the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, the former deputy British prime minister Nick Clegg and the Fox News populist Steve Hilton \u2013 does in fact have good neighbors. For all the wealth, they say \u2013 median home prices and home sales ranging between $7m and $8.65m and a median household income of $525,000 \u2013 the community doesn\u2019t flaunt its money.

According to housing advocates, the town has set up legal boundaries to remain exclusive and put up obstacles against efforts to build affordable housing during a statewide housing crisis.", "\u201cAtherton is the most expensive zip code in the country because they have designed themselves to be that way,\u201d said Jordan Grimes, a housing advocate on the San Francisco peninsula. \u201cThere aren\u2019t literal gates. They aren\u2019t literally a gated city, but they are metaphorically a gated one and they have done that by zoning. Many, many cities in the country do zoning in this way, but Atherton is what you could say is the most successful in using zoning to keep out anyone who is not wealthy or white.\u201d", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest The entrance to Holbrook-Palmer park, the only recreation site in the town.

That mindset and history has remained.\u201d", "In a town of just over 7,100 residents, the population is 73% white. No commercial zoning exists within town limits, meaning there are no restaurants, cafes, shops or grocery stores. The town is almost entirely residential \u2013 just 5% consists of parks and open space, and 6% of public and private schools and municipal facilities like the police department.", "house + surveillance Left: Many homes are walled off, with objects preventing street parking along the shoulder.

In a state where land is expensive and housing is scarce, the town\u2019s zoning and one acre-lot requirement has all but guaranteed that only the wealthy can afford to build and live in Atherton.", "California has a mandate called the regional housing needs allocation that requires all cities to create housing for people of all incomes, from very low to above-moderate income. In November, George Rodericks, Atherton\u2019s city manager, drafted a letter to the Association of Bay Area Governments asking that the planning committee reassess its allocation methodology. His argument was that the methodology \u201crelies heavily on proximity to jobs as a factor\u201d and Atherton\u2019s \u201clong-standing character is as a residential community\u201d.", "While he had a point \u2013 Atherton has no land zoned for commercial activity \u2013 the number of landscapers, contractors, plumbers, electricians, painters and cleaners who inundate the town limits to service the various mansions during the work week is a wonder of its own. On a recent Thursday, so many pickup trucks of landscapers and contractors lined Atherton Avenue that a taco truck and a pupusa truck parked along the stretch to feed the workers.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest With limited dining options in the town, food trucks serve service workers.

To housing advocates, talk about \u201cimpacts on community character\u201d is nothing more than a dog whistle for racism and classism \u2013 and also, they said, nothing new for the town of Atherton, where a former Google executive resigned from a local school board last month after his wife tweeted sexist and racist remarks about Kamala Harris, the vice-president-elect.", "tree + women Left: A Tesla parked between two homes for sale.

In particular, the resolution called out a bill that failed by three votes that would have changed zoning laws to allow for more multifamily housing development in neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes. The current structure allows local jurisdictions to determine zoning, and now less than a quarter of developable land in much of the state is zoned for multifamily housing, which has played a large part in California\u2019s housing crisis.", "An Atherton city council staff report on the resolution noted that the \u201cdevelopment of high density and/or high-rise residential structures or commercial uses of any kind would destroy the scenic, semi-rural and open space character of the Town\u201d. Atherton\u2019s general plan consists of mostly being \u201ccommitted to maintaining its semi-rural environment\u201d and that the \u201cpreservation of trees, particularly heritage oak trees, is a high priority\u201d. \u201cThe Town is essentially fully developed and desires to retain its current character,\u201d the report reads.", "California home to 91 of America's 100 most expensive zip codes Read more", "The town was so concerned with retaining \u201cits current character\u201d that it endorsed the closure of its Caltrain commuter train station, in part becausethe bill \u2013 which its author, the state senator Scott Wiener, has committed to resurrecting in some form \u2013 would have eliminated zoning restrictions specifically on transportation to allow for more high-density housing.", "DeGolia said Atherton was not against building affordable housing. He noted the long commutes of the town\u2019s police officers \u2013 some are forced to travel two hours round trip from the Central Valley because housing is unaffordable in the Bay Area \u2013 and wished they had better options closer by. But he said affordable housing couldn\u2019t be a one-size-fits-all solution. The town\u2019s issues with the state legislative efforts, as well as the regional housing allotment, had been that they wanted to override local authority and push for multifamily housing, the mayor said.", "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Zoning, real estate and financial management offices in nearby Menlo Park.

Even though with zoning changes, high-density housing could be built on any one-acre parcel for sale in the town, he worried about the parking problems it would create if the residents had to park on the street. And then there was the aesthetic.", "\u201cWhat are you going to do, you\u2019re going to put a multi-unit building in between 10 other properties that are single-family homes?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to feel like a neighborhood.\u201d", "In Atherton, the city council passed an ordinance that allowed for homeowners to build accessory dwelling units on their properties. The town has issued more than 100 building permits for such units this year, DeGolia said. While these units could be anything from in-law units for extended family to detached guest houses for current residents, DeGolia hoped that they would become rental units for teachers and police officers.", "He acknowledged that it was not guaranteed that these units would become rentals \u2013 it would be up to the individual homeowners to build them and rent them out. \u201cBut that\u2019s always true,\u201d DeGolia said. \u201cIt\u2019s not guaranteed that housing is ever going to happen.\u201d", "El Camino Real Left: A Goodwill drop off location just outside of Atherton.

When his neighbors\u2019 hens got loose, he and another neighbor went door to door to find out who they belonged to. Afterwards, as a thank you, that hens\u2019 owner and her two children baked them chocolate chip cookies. \u201cLast summer, our neighbor\u2019s rabbits got loose, and we were all out there with flashlights, looking for them,\u201d he said.", "During the pandemic, the circus club was quick to set up a socially distanced physical education camp for the kids to blow off some steam and offer some relief for working parents. They also asked all their members to voluntarily donate to an angel fund for their staff. \u201cWe were able to, on two different occasions, give money to our employees, recognizing that their families were maybe not as fully employed as they were beforehand,\u201d he said.", "\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Seabolt said. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed.
