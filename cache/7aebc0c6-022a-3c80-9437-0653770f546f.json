Since shame accrues to debt as inexorably as interest, many people don\u2019t like to talk about the topic, rendering it even less visible. (An exception is the President, who has boasted, \u201cI\u2019ve made a fortune by using debt.\u201d) Like many other problems in America, debt is often a systemic dilemma for which individual solutions are expected\u2014save more, cut up your credit cards, get a second or a third or a fourth job. More than half of all overdue debt on Americans\u2019 credit reports is from medical bills\u2014which, given the fundamental facts of human morbidity and mortality, can be neither avoided nor entirely planned for, especially in the absence of universal health insurance. Meanwhile, forty-five million people in the United States carry a collective total of 1.5 trillion dollars in student debt, a direct result of a punishing formula: since the eighties, college tuition has risen at four times the rate of inflation and eight times that of household income. People make, and spend, their own money, to paraphrase Marx (who knew a thing or two about debt, both personally and politically), but not under circumstances of their own making.", "For all of these reasons, a good deal of the power in the new book \u201cThe Debt Project: 99 Portraits Across America,\u201d by the photographer Brittany M. Powell, comes from a kind of transgressive mundaneness. Powell set about photographing ninety-nine Americans who owe money (she ended up with a few more, including herself, but started with that figure as a reference to the slogan \u201cWe are the ninety-nine per cent\u201d) and asked them to handwrite accompanying text about how much they owe, and to whom. The litany of reasons gets repetitive, because that\u2019s how it goes\u2014difficulty finding a job in one\u2019s field after graduating during the recession, a bad marriage, a bad divorce, vertiginous rents in expensive cities, medical crises, many, many student loans. Occasionally, there are epic and awful variations: one woman\u2019s mother took out credit cards in her name and, in a ten-year period, racked up \u201ca mortgage worth of debt\u201d to fund her \u201ccompulsive shopping and hoarding habits.\u201d", "Powell photographed her subjects in their homes, often in their bedrooms, and the portraits have the intimacy and lived-in particularity that derives from seeing people in their own spaces, surrounded by their own possessions. Powell told me that she had Flemish portrait painting in mind\u2014the way the genre depicted people among their belongings, conveying both economic rank and the ephemerality of worldly goods. Like such portraits, Powell\u2019s are suffused with dramatic natural light, saturated color, and calm dignity. She wasn\u2019t going for a fly-on-the-wall documentary feel\u2014no sense of \u201cgotcha\u201d here. Her subjects are all photographed from eye level or below, what she calls an \u201cempowering\u201d perspective.", "Naomi, an art therapist in Brooklyn, who says she owes seventy-five thousand dollars, mostly in student loans from a graduate degree, is shown seated on a gray couch, gaze straightforward, hands clasped in her lap, feet encased in striped socks, next to a shelf full of nuts and seeds in mason jars that made me think of the phrase \u201csquirrelling away\u201d for a rainy day. A woman named Simone, who owes three hundred and thirty-two thousand dollars, for a mortgage and student loans, poses outside a tent on her property; she is living in the tent while she rents out her house to save money. She is neatly dressed in a sky-blue skirt, her legs crossed at the ankles, a mug with an upside-down rainbow on it cradled in her hands; there\u2019s a camping stove visible in the background. Simone is resigned to a lifetime of debt: \u201cMy mortgage isn\u2019t changing and I\u2019ll never pay off my student loans,\u201d she writes in her accompanying text, \u201cso although I obsess about them, I don\u2019t really \u2018worry\u2019 about them.\u201d The youngest person in the book, a nineteen-year-old from Boston named Lauren, is a student and waitress who is already sixty-four thousand dollars in hock, \u201cfrom this past year of college in addition to living expenses and my father being out of work due to legal and health circumstances.\u201d Her room is a congenial clutter of memories, a college student\u2019s palimpsest: photos of friends and family taped to the walls, a tarot deck, piles of notebooks, a little cactus in a red pot on the windowsill. Lauren gazes downward, cuddling a pet bunny.", "Powell started the project in 2013, just after filing for bankruptcy herself. She, too, had student-loan debt. She was living with three roommates in San Francisco, where so many people leave their hearts and their financial solvency. She had landed a dream project, working on a long-term assignment for National Geographic, but, even with the other gigs she managed to stitch together\u2014freelance work, teaching surfing on the weekends\u2014Powell \u201cwas always inches away from disaster, putting car repairs and vet bills on a credit card, or charging necessities and gasoline\u201d in order to pay rent or make debt payments. As she proceeded through the bankruptcy system, Powell began to think about how debt shapes American culture, \u201csocially and financially,\u201d she writes in the introduction to her book. \u201cI was surprised that once I filed, I no longer felt ashamed about my experience, and I wanted to talk to others about theirs.\u201d", "At first, Powell photographed people she knew, but, she told me, \u201cI wanted it to be about more than my artist friends in San Francisco who were struggling.\u201d So she put together a Kickstarter campaign for the project (\u201cI didn\u2019t want to rack up more debt doing this\u201d) and started advertising on Craigslist, offering people twenty-five to fifty dollars to pose and share their stories. Taking to the road, Powell photographed subjects all over the country\u2014some whose livelihoods you might guess would be chancy (grad students, musicians, writers, restaurant workers, a tattoo artist, a hair stylist) and some whose you might not (a surveyor, a clinical-trials supervisor, a physician, an economics professor). She finished the project seven years later\u2014\u201cexactly the amount of time it took for my bankruptcy to be removed from my credit report and financial record\u201d\u2014and just before the pandemic tipped so many more Americans into economic precarity. Between 2016 and 2019, she moved to Vermont, got married, had a baby, and bought a house.", "Stories of people clambering out of debt on their own, as Powell did, are hopeful, but even more so are those people who have organized to help one another. The foreword to Powell\u2019s book is written by Astra Taylor, a filmmaker and veteran of the Occupy movement, who co-founded an organization called the Debt Collective, which exposes predatory lending practices, informs people of their rights, and organizes student-debt strikes. Its slogan, a rich double-entendre, is \u201cYou are not a loan.\u201d Powell\u2019s portraits in \u201cThe Debt Project,\u201d with their forthright and mostly unsmiling subjects, are a record of people struggling to remind themselves that such a statement is true.", "\u201cDebt Portrait #84, Waterville Valley, NH, 2020.\u201d", "Fran\u00e7ois Bessing, freelance performer.", "Fifty-five thousand dollars in debt.", "Bessing writes:", "-Graduated top of my class in 2017 with B.A. in Music (Vocal Performance)", "-Can\u2019t find stable work in field", "-Had legal troubles.

From 1988-1998 she incurred \u2018a mortgage worth of debt\u2019 (according to my bankruptcy attorney) on my SSI, mostly to fuel her compulsive shopping and hoarding habits. I have no credit debt, just about $3000-$5000 owed to various banks and cell phone companies and other evil corporations who hit me with erroneous charges. But I was an idiot and took out the maximum student loans available to me, even though I had a graduate teaching assistantship w/a stipend and tuition remission. I have defaulted, and interest has risen. I owed about $139,000 last time I opened a bill several years ago.
